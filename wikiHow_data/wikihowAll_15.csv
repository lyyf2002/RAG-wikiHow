This of course should include all your friends, but also consider inviting the shy quiet classmate who is always by him/herself. Try to get this person to come out of their shell and party; you never know what you might learn.


Choose good music. Pick something you can dance to!
Get snacks.Provide mini hot dogs on a toothpick, Hawaiian punch with sherbet and sprite, squares of cheese on a stick, fruit kabobs, hamburgers and some desert.
Have a contest or plan fun games.;
, You can either do this by yourself or invite your friends. Print out a bunch of photos and buy some stickers, glue, etc (You can purchase what you need from a dollar store or a Walmart). If you are with your friends, ask them to bring copies of pictures they have. Have some snacks while making it and come up with captions for each image. Don't forget you can use old magazines and draw on the scrapbook too! Add glitter and/or stickers.

, Be it in in a nature preserve, a park, or in your back yard, picnics are a fun way to get out and about with your friends. Depending on where you have the picnic, you could also include a slip and slide, water balloons or water gun fight at the picnic, especially if it's a hot day. Provide a little extra food and tell everyone to bring raincoats or at least old rags and goggles (so that no one gets something in their eyes) for a food fight.

, See if you can get together an entourage of ten or twenty. If the theater happens to be in a mall, after the movie is over you can go shopping or eat in the food court. Smaller groups are great too of course, but going in a large group is a great way to join all your friends outside of school.

, See who can get the most tickets. Consider having a contest: Set a cash limit and the person with the most tickets once everyone has spent that amount gets a portion of everyone else's tickets! If there are twenty people participating and everyone gets a lot of tickets, just think about a big prize that at least one person might be able to win.


Remember to bring plenty of quarters or dollars to cash in for tokens.

, Invite your friends over for a sleepover. Have a pillow fight. Watch scary movies, play video games all night, talk, have makeovers... what ever you want. You can play tag in the dark at your house or play hide and seek in the dark. Do something that is fun! If you have redone your bedroom, you can also take this as a chance to show off your room's new look.

, There are all kinds of Cons: Anime-cons, Furry-cons, Renaissance Fairs, etc. If all the actual cons that interest you are too expensive or too far away, create one in your backyard! It can be anything you want it to be, such as a Danny Phantom Con, or a Scrubs Con, or a South Park Con. Get all your friends to come up dressed up as a character.


Have various friends provide food and drinks. Ask your artist friends to draw or make things to sell or give away at the con. You should also come up with some appropriate games that go along with the theme.

, Joining a club is a great way to make new friends who share your same interests. If you can't find any clubs in your area that interest you, consider making up a club with your friends! You can invite new people to be members or just keep it between you.

, If you like wolves, you can always play a wolf on a role-playing forum that is all about wolves. That or you and your friends can create a role-playing forum for that specific purpose and it doesn't have to be wolves, it can be tigers, lions, bears, meerkats, Harry Potter, university, etc.

, Try to do this somewhere where it's safe and allowed. You could always make an area in your own yard if your parents allow you to make a small square and place concrete there. You could make make-shift ramps. However, it's just as easy to go to a park with a place designed for skateboarding. You could show off to friends what you know and Try to teach others to skateboard so that they can join in too. You could also pick a few impartial judges and have a skateboarding contest.

, Invite a bunch of your friends to go camping. You don't have to go camping in the woods—if you'd rather you can camp out in your backyard or even the beach. If you are going to go camping in the park or backyard, have a barbecue or picnic. If you are camping at the park see if you can go fishing if there is a pond there. If you are going to go camping at the beach or park make sure that you are allowed to camp out in those areas!

, This is an awesome way to get out of the house for a couple weeks and you discover a new talent such as trekking or rock climbing!

, To some this idea might not seem fun, but it can be turned into a fun activity, and it will make your parents happy. Ask your parents if you can listen to very loud music while you clean to help motivate you.


Make a contest with your friends! Before starting, take pictures of each section of your room including: the floor, under your bed, the closet, your dresser, and your bed. In addition, take a single picture of the entire room from the door. Then, repeat the photos after you've finished cleaning. Have your friends do the same. Get an impartial judge to decide who did the best job—the winner gets a prize! You can also put the pictures you took into a scrapbook and then you can begin redecorating your room.

, Summer is a great time to reinvent yourself and your room. Consider giving your bedroom a makeover!


Begin by getting some catalogs on bedspreads, paints, bedroom furniture, curtains and maybe even carpets and lights too.
Go through each catalog and cut out what you like best. See if you think it fits together with the rest of the things you might like.
Remember that new carpet and dressers costs more than paint, bedspreads, and curtains combined. If you're set on the more expensive makeover, consider getting looking at second hand or thrift stores for unique, cheap(er) dressers.
Go shopping for accessories, such as: posters, pictures, games, bulletin board, bean bag cushion, lava lamp, bookshelf and books, wastepaper basket and whatever you think you might like to have in your room.

, A short story can be as short as 500 words and as long as 10,000 words. Your story can be about anything you want. Have a friend or two look over your first draft (offer to look over theirs too if you want!). Then, have an English teacher or librarian go over for any missed spelling or grammar mistakes. When you're done, get the cover laminated and give it to your librarian to keep in the library!

, Alcohol free, obviously, but you can still make drinks like at bars without the alcohol. Consider making a Virgin Bloody Mary, piña colada, Root beer Float, Pink-Grapefruit 'Margaritas', etc. (Non-Alcohol beverages that are made to seem like the real deal are called ""Virgin Drinks"") You can find recipes online or ask a parent and see if you can use glasses that are similar to those used in bars. Be the bartender and ask a friend or two to be the waiter and set up a couple mock tables with card tables and folding chairs. Put pretzels and salted peanuts on each counter and table.


Don't forget to have a deck or two of cards on hand! You could pretend gamble with fake/monopoly money or poker chips. Give each card player the same number of poker chips. To take some poker chips out of the game after people have been playing awhile offer some drinks up for a number of poker chips until no one has anymore poker chips.
If you have a Foosball table already or a dart board hang it somewhere outside to give it more of a bar feel.
Put up a price list for everything if you want—you could make real money, or have funny prices like ""Virgin Piña Colada costs 1 silly dance"".
Allow your parents to come check and make sure they are okay with you mimicking a bar setting (with no alcohol). If you want, ask them if they'd stay in the house and they can come out once every half-hour or hour.

, Everyone loves sweets right? Have fun over the summer by baking sweets and chocolates! You can find recipes in old cookbooks and online. Have fun—invite friends over and take silly pictures where you're covered in flour or chocolate.


If you make a lot of treats, take some over to a senior center! Enjoy getting to know the people there and watching them eat the treats with tea. If you want, take some pictures and develop them. Then, mail the senior home a copy! Make sure you call ahead of time—some senior centers might not let their residents have anything sweet.

, Not only can it be fun and enjoyable and you at least have something to do for a couple hours a week or a day, it'll look awesome on a resume or college application. A great place to volunteer is a local animal shelter or retirement center, but depending upon where one lives not the only possibilities.


Look into possibilities at women's shelters, homeless shelters, soup kitchens. Ask around your community for where the need is greatest and offer your time and skills there.
You can also do volunteer work that's cleaning up a park, or helping in an urban community garden which are great ways to get outside in the summer!

, Some children might not have siblings or two parents, some might be foster kids or need better influences. As a big buddy, you get to be an older teen and hang out with a child or younger teen as a good influence. You can do whatever you want, be it a night at the theatre, your favorite restaurant, a sunny park or sports game. You can also take pictures and make scrapbooks of your time together. And, as always, you'll get to laugh at the funny things little kids do.


If you can't find a program in your area, ask a teacher at an elementary or middle school if they can help you find a Little Buddy. Don't think of this as babysitting without pay, but like another form of volunteering. You might end up with a new friend for life!
If they invite you to their birthday party, go to it! You will make your Little Buddy's day.

, It can be co-ed and can be any sport such as Basketball, Baseball/Softball, Football, Rugby, Ultimate Frisbee, Golf, Horseshoes, Lawn Bowling, Pool, Kickball, Soccer, Hockey, Dodge Ball etc.. as long as you have enough friends who want to play. You can also join a program for certain sports during the summer season to practice. These are especially important if you want to Try to get a scholarship to college for a certain sport or even want to be a professional someday.

, You'll be earning some pocket money and will be occupied. Get a job where it will be fun. Some places to consider apply are the bowling alley, pizza shop, ice cream shop, the mall, the amusement park, or the zoo. You can also Try to get an internship if you want to get more experience related to a specific career.

, If you're planning to take the SAT, consider taking a prep class over the summer. You'll meet new people and improve your chances of doing well on the SAT!

, Help out whichever parent does most of the cooking and cleaning so that they can get a break! If you have younger siblings offer to take of them for a while each day so that your parents can have some time off.

Learn to cook so that you can wow your family with fun and exciting summer recipes!

, Use and improve your skills while you have time. It may become a hobby to enjoy once you're good at it. Let's say you are enthused about classic cars. You can help your dad restore a classic car and show it.

, Summer doesn't have to be fun and games. It can also be a time for resting your brain after all that hard work at school. Go ahead; sleep in if you want. Watch some television, walk around in your bare feet, just whatever puts you in a calm mood.

, You will learn to work in a group, which will be both beneficial in life and fun. Choose one that you truly enjoy or that requires the skills that you have (such as hand/eye coordination). There are always summer sports, camps, and some schools may have sports in the summer, such as track or lacrosse.

, Now you can actually work towards them without the worries of what others at school will think of you. Go ahead and lose weight, clear up your skin, pursue a hobby, feed your knowledge, just whatever floats your boat.

, Go to the mall, the beach, the library, ride a bike, or hang out with a group of friends. You can also have a party or sleepover if you're allowed. Now you don't have to worry about your parents saying, ""No, because it's a school night.""

, During the summer there can be a lot opportunities. Start a fundraiser to help support a good cause! Have a garage sale, a yard sale, a bake sale, a car wash, anything!

, You could take time to write a novel, find out who you truly are, discover the meaning of life, look for true beauty, or have some ""family time."" Now that you don't have the stress of peer pressure and studying, you have the time.

, Not only will you get a chance to work on your tan in the hot sun and spray your friends with hoses, but you'll be making money too. You can use that money to do something later.

, This is still fun during the day as well as night. Just make sure you can convince some friends to come with you. It's somewhat embarrassing to be caught alone in a movie theater.

, Exercise is healthy and is a good way to meet members of the opposite (or same) sex, or to entertain any younger siblings that you may caring for. What's not to like?

, It sounds childish, but it actually can be fun if you have enough people and enough space. Try it in a public area like a mall or a crowded shopping type area., You are your own master and if you want to stay home one day to relax, do it!

,, If you live in a warm area, grab some blankets and a pillow and sleep out on the lawn furniture, under the stars. It's very relaxing, and might be the best night of sleep you'll get all summer.

, Crack a window open if you can, and wake up to the sounds of the morning; people mowing the lawn, your mom making breakfast downstairs, etc. If you're not tired, go on a late night walk or jog. Usually the sprinklers are on at this time and its just a lot of fun to see your neighborhood in the middle of the night.

, This will help you keep up on your writing skills for school, too. Write down words that you like, poems, song lyrics, what happened during basketball practice, anything you want! Keep it under your mattress if you want to keep it private; this only works if you step up and change your own sheets. And most importantly, write in it everyday; maybe wait to look at the previous pages until the very end of summer, when it should be all full.

, It will help you get in shape and you will enjoy being in nature.

, It's something to do, you meet new people, and you will have a great body when school starts again!

, This is entertaining and will help you do better in school come fall with the new vocabulary you have learned. Focus on your brain; something useful to make you smarter and more interesting to others.

, It's a great way to get rid of junk or things that you don't use anymore! Plus you can make a good amount of money through this. You can also ask your parents to create an eBay account so you can buy and sell items on eBay.

, That is a way to catch up with your schoolwork, learn a new hobby, or prepare for future education. In this generation, you don't have to be ""college age"" to go to college; you can get college degrees online at the age of 14. If you can't find any online classes, try taking community ed classes at your local library.

, Enjoy it; the rest of the year you are involved in school.

Relax.",How to Survive Cotillion for Girls," Whether or not you want to participate in cotillion, it's very important to your parents. You might feel that cotillion is an outdated custom, and in many ways it is, but cotillion is not without its benefits! It provides a chance to learn life skills and make important connections that will benefit you once you start making your way in the world.


Try to appreciate the gesture. Cotillion might not be a blast, but your parents want you to participate because they want the absolute best for you.
Your parents feel that the benefits of cotillion are important enough to require your participation, so try to give it a chance.
Besides, you probably aren’t going to be able to talk them out of it, so just accept it for what it is – a few months of classes and a fancy party.;
, You will get to meet lots of new people, learn some very useful social skills (even if they don’t quite seem useful to you yet), dance with your new friends, see relatives that you love, and eat some delicious food while everyone celebrates your entry into adult society.That’s not so bad! You can definitely get through this.


Learning etiquette and dancing may feel stuffy and boring now, but in time you’ll understand why they made you do it.
Since there’s essentially no way you are getting out of it, it only benefits you to start looking on the bright side now! Try to look for the silver lining if you can.
Dreading cotillion every second of every day until it happens will probably only make the entire ordeal worse for you.

, Cotillion classes and the ball itself may not sound very exciting to you, but since you're in it for the long haul, try to get what you can from the experience. Learn what you can and get to know your classmates. Try to have a little fun in whatever ways you can.


No matter how you feel about cotillion, it will be an experience unlike any other you'll have in your lifetime. Collecting new experiences is always interesting!

, Yes, you probably have things you’d rather be doing during the months of October through April (which is the traditional cotillion season) other than going to boring classes about fork usage and manners. You already have to go to school all day, and now you have to take all of these extra classes on top of that? You are probably thinking it's a little unfair.


Vent to your friends if you need to, but complaining to your parents will only make your life harder.
Not only that, but complaining solves nothing and generally just makes you feel worse.

, Not everything you learn in cotillion classes will be incredibly useful, but there are definitely some important things to take away from them. Social skills are necessary if you want to be successful in life. Manners and proper etiquette might be boring to learn about, but having those skills will actually help you a lot in the future.You may never dance those particular dances ever again, but learning dancing of any kind will teach you physical coordination and grace

.

Pay attention in class and absorb this stuff because you will have to prove that you know it – in front of a bunch of people – at the cotillion ball.
Tuning out the classes may feel like a rebellious act toward your parents now, but on the night of cotillion, everyone will be looking at you – not them.

, If nothing else, cotillion is a chance to meet a lot of new people.You might meet your future best friend at cotillion, or your future boyfriend or girlfriend at the ball. You will get to mix and mingle with your peers, all of whom are dealing with the stress and suffering of cotillion, just like you.


Even if the subject matter bores you to tears and the ball itself completely freaks you out, the opportunity to meet new people is never a bad thing.
Once you make friends, cotillion-related things that seemed dull before might suddenly seem legitimately fun. Or at least funny! Friends make everything better.

, Your parents are proud of you and they want to present you to the entire world. Yes, all of the classes and preparation can be a little tiring, but there are plenty of opportunities for you to have some fun at cotillion.


If you don't feel excited about cotillion, that's ok! But you can feel excited about your future, which is what cotillion is really about.

, Start dress hunting around Christmas time, which is about 5 months before the event. You know what you need – the tradition is a fancy white dress and white satin gloves.Your particular cotillion may or may not ascribe to that tradition, but some sort of evening gown will be required. Even if you hate wearing dresses, try not to worry too much! It's only for one night.


If you aren’t sure what style of dress to get, check out some cotillion photos online to see what other girls have worn. Take a trusted friend or family member with you when you go shopping, so that you can get an honest opinion when you try things on.
Make sure you get something that fits you well, and that you feel good in. The ball will be anxiety-inducing enough on its own – make sure your dress is the least of your worries!

, You will be dancing and moving around quite a bit at the ball, so you really want to make sure you get the right shoes. If you choose your shoes based on looks alone, you may end up being miserable that night because you can’t dance in them, or because they are squeezing your feet too tightly.


Try your shoes on before you buy them and walk around the store until you get a sense of how they’ll perform at the ball.
Practice walking and dancing in your chosen shoes during the weeks leading up to the ball, so that you’ll feel secure in them when the time comes.

, You’ll be practicing plenty at your classes, but do a little additional practice at home, as well. Put on your dress and shoes and practice all of the things you know you’ll be doing at the ball. After you practice a bit, you’ll start feeling a lot less nervous.


Invite your friends from class over so that you can practice together. Try to make it fun instead of dreading it.

, Traditionally, cotillion balls were mainly held so that girls could find potential suitors. Today, that is no longer the case. Instead, they are mostly viewed as networking opportunities.Don't feel obligated to act super girly or pressured to find a significant other. Cotillion isn't really about those things anymore.


You’ll have your new friends by your side and you’ll be practicing a lot before the ball, so you will know exactly what you need to do and how to do it.
Although it may not feel like it, cotillion will be over before you know it.

Another option is to go to the beach or to visit a nearby lake or pond. If those options aren't available to you, simply sit under a sprinkler to cool down.Swimming helps to work your muscles that are often neglected during workouts, such as deltoids, triceps and biceps.

, Make sure that you avoid running during the hottest part of the day, which tends to be from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m. in the summer. Try running either before the sun comes up or after the sun goes down to stay comfortable. Stay hydrated and drink plenty of water after your run., Walk along a trail that has been marked, or blaze your own trail.

If using the oven or cooking implements that don’t belong to you, be sure to first get permission.

, If you are traveling to another country or city, then go to many different venues and attractions. Don't restrict your visit to malls and restaurants.

, Doing stupid stuff is always more fun when you have a friend over.

, You can do almost all of this at home, and if you can't go to the mall to reinvent your clothing, try Internet shopping!

, Try wikiHow and Urban Dictionary, as well as looking up or discovering bands on PureVolume. YouTube is also excellent. And, on all of these sites, you can create or add pages. Or, if you're really bored, you can try World of Warcraft or the Sims. Keep up with your friends and play around with the stuff on your favorite social networking site such as Facebook, Instagram, or Tumblr.

, Like redecorating your room, or starting a website or making a new album. (See related wikiHows). Make it time consuming, and work on it in a focused and conscientious way until it's finished. This will give you great satisfaction when it's done.

, Learn about stuff. The Internet is great, and so is the library. Choose a subject and become an expert.

Or for a less ""old-school"" read, try ""East of Eden."" If a book's too much like work, try some poetry - it's nice and short. Lord Byron, Tennyson, and Emily Dickinson are all very cool. If you've started a Classic but never finished, here's your chance to do so now! Or, if you find slogging through the book too difficult, try listening to it on a cassette, when you can tune out of the boring bits!

, Watch movies on TV and then think about them, discuss them, pick them apart with family members or friends. That's what movie critics do. It's fun, and you'll be able to win at Movie Trivial Pursuit or Scene It? later on. Do the same thing with music - analyze the style, the beat and critique about it. You might be on All Music Guide.

, Lie out on a sun lounger with a good book or magazine or listen to music with your iPod/MP3/PSP. You'll get some fresh air, a nice tan and it's a great way to spend the day. You don't have to do anything special to have a fantastic summer! Enjoy the peace and quiet and the chance to relax!

, If you can't find anything to watch, you can always go to your library and rent movies and TV shows, or stream them or download them off the internet if you have a fast enough internet connection. You can rent a few good movies or go to the show with friends if there is a great summer blockbuster.

Search camps according to location.,
Review camp websites.,
Call camps for additional information.,
Ask your counselors and teachers for camp recommendations.,
Talk to your counselors and teachers about your goals.",How to Find a Summer Camp Job1," Camps like to have staff in place well before summer sessions begin, often before registration. Some even begin hiring during the winter. Therefore, if you know you want a summer camp job, you should start looking as early as possible. Doing so will give you more options and increase your chances of landing a desirable job.;
, If you have a specific location in mind, conduct a search for camps in that general area. Use your favorite internet search engine and enter the keywords “summer camp” and the name of your desired area. When this information pops up, you can make a list of possibilities and do some research on them.

, If the camp has a website, you can gain all kinds of valuable information by spending some time there. Read as much as possible. Some basic information to consider:


camp culture
camp mission
programs available
session dates and times
special requirements for employment (minimum age, experience, or certifications)
available jobs

, If there is no camp website (or if the website offers minimal information), call the camp to speak with a representative and request that a brochure be mailed to you.

, Counselors and educators sometimes have lists of camps in your area based on their specialties (for example, robotics camp for future engineers). They may be personally familiar with some of these camps, or they may have worked at some of them. These people can therefore me excellent resources – ask them for recommendations!

, While you are asking for camp recommendations, be sure to discuss your strengths, weaknesses, and long-term goals.

, Some camps have rules and regulations about who can work there or who can work in specific jobs. This is information that you need. It is pointless, for example, to apply for a job that requires nursing certification if you are not a nurse. Age may also be a factor: some camps require counselors to be 16, 17, or 18. Call, email, or check the camp website to determine what the regulations are for a particular camp.

, Camps want to hire individuals who can pass a background check and provide excellent references. Seek references from people who know you well and are not family members; make sure you choose people who will provide positive information about your character and skills. Potential referees include:


teachers
coaches
counselors
former employers

, Traditional slumber parties take place indoors, usually in the living room or the bedroom of the hostess. However, if you want to take your party to the next level, consider hosting an outdoors pajama party using the backyard as the party area. You can also set up tents as your shelter.

, From video games to board games to pajama party classics like truth or dare, the possibilities are endless. Set aside a few games that you know most of your friends like playing. During the party, let your friends vote on which ones they would like to play.

, A pajama party can be a great time if you and your friends just talk the night away. However, having a few activities planned out can make the night even more fun. You and your guests could:


Make homemade spa treatments. These can range from applying face masks - cucumbers for the eyes are a must - to doing mani/pedis or makeovers. Snap before and after pictures.
Set up a selfie wall. Hang fabric on a wall and print out signs that you can use as props for an amazing photobooth-like experience.Create a dance routine. Look up YouTube videos for choreography inspiration or try to mimic your favorite artist’s moves. Record yourselves for a fun memory to look back on.
Do karaoke. If you have a karaoke machine, this would be the perfect time to use it. If you don’t have one, look up song instrumentals on YouTube to sing along with or simply sing loudly over the track. You can use hairbrushes or water bottles as your microphones.

Make a pillow fort. If you have big couch cushions, you can use these as ‘walls.’ Thin sheets or blankets make the perfect roof., During the party, let your friends choose which one(s) to watch. Go for movies that aren’t scary so that all your guests can have a good time.

, The perfect snacks for pajama parties are fun finger-foods. Your best bets are popcorn, pretzels, and chips, plus some fruit for good measure.These snacks are delicious and easy to clean up. If you can, purchase a variety of snacks so that your friends have a variety of options to choose from.


Don’t forget to buy disposable cups, napkins, and plates.
Only buy caffeinated drinks or sodas if you plan on you or your friends being awake all night.Ask your friends to let you know if they're allergic to any food so that you can avoid serving it.

, Balloons and streamers are great decorations regardless of the theme of the pajama party. Dim or turn off the main lights and add fairy lights instead to create a cozier atmosphere.Pick a theme for the party and decorate accordingly. For example, if you’re having a rockstar-themed pajama party, you could have decorations like CDs or cutouts of music notes taped to the walls. You might even lay down a red carpet for your friends to pose on.
If your pajama party is outdoors, count on setting up tents and having flashlights ready.

, This only applies if your pajama party doubles as a birthday party.Party favors could vary from store-bought trinkets, like mini-notebooks or key chains, to something you make with your guests at the party, like friendship bracelets or tye-dye shirts.


If you plan to create party favors during the event, make sure to gather all the necessary items beforehand. For example, if you’re making keepsake collages, set aside glue, paper, scissors, and magazines the day before the party.
You might also provide toothbrushes and toothpaste for your guests - these often go forgotten at pajama parties, but they are a thoughtful detail.

, Ask your friends to help you put away things - from games to food - in the morning so that cleaning up seems less like a chore. You can even make a game out of it - whoever can put away the most items gets a prize!

Pack personal hygiene products.,
Bring your gadgets.,
Check if there will be a bed provided.,
Bring a sleeping bag.,
Pack a stuffed animal.,
Pack your favorite board game.",How to Pack for a Last Call Sleepover (Girls)," This could be your school backpack or even a duffel bag, as long as it's an appropriate size to be able to hold any necessary items. Before packing, check your bag for any tears or signs that it's falling apart; otherwise, it might rip and cause all your belongings to spill out.;
, Once you have found a bag, pack a change of clothes and extra underwear for the next day, but make sure to check the weather ahead of time before deciding on an outfit. If it's cold, toss in a sweater or cardigan in case you need it.

, You can bring your favorite pajamas or some old clothes as long as you feel comfortable in them. However, make sure that your sleep attire is appropriate and that your top isn't too loose or low since you'll be with other people. You should also be sure that you won't feel embarrassed about others seeing your pajamas; if you feel uncomfortable at the thought of bringing them, choose another pair or simply bring an old T-shirt and comfortable pants.

, If you're planning on wearing sneakers, you'll most likely need them for the next day, as your old pair may smell bad. You may also want to bring a pair of flip-flops in case you want to feel comfortable or something happens to your shoes. You should also consider the weather and what activities you and your friends may participate in - that will help you choose the right pair of shoes to bring or wear.

, These necessary items include a toothbrush, toothpaste, hairbrush/comb, makeup for the day, makeup wipes, and deodorant. You may also want to bring your facial cleansing products. It's best to mentally go through your morning and night routines so that you can decide what items you'll need to bring. If it helps, make a checklist and go through it to ensure that you don't forget anything important.

, Make sure that you have your cellphone in case you need to contact your parents or an emergency occurs. You can also bring your iPod and chargers if necessary, although charging all your electronic devices the day before can help save space in your bag. If you want to take some pictures with your friends, you could also bring a camera or simply use your phone.

, Being familiar with your temporary sleeping arrangements is essential, as it helps you decide what items you'll need to bring for a good night's rest. If your friend will be giving you a bed, you won't need to bring anything, although you could pack a pillow or blanket if you want to.

, If you won't be provided with a bed, you'll need to bring any necessary items to make sure you'll be comfortable on the floor. Along with a sleeping bag, you should also bring a pillow and one or two blankets to keep you warm and cozy.

, This is recommended if this is your first time sleeping away from home or it makes you feel safer, as having a soft cuddly toy with you can help soothe your fears and worries. Although you may feel embarrassed about bringing one, remember that you have every right to do what you want as long as it makes you happy and doesn't harm anyone. If your friends are truly there for you, they will understand and not hurt your feelings. However, if they do tease you, firmly tell them to stop and ask that they respect your decision.

, Sleepovers can quickly become boring if there are no fun activities to participate in. It's best to bring along a game that can keep everyone entertained and allow you to bond with them. You could also play games on your phone if you like, although you should use it sparingly in case you need to make an important call or an emergency occurs.

Grab some comfy pajamas (PJs).,
Pack the basics.,
Pack deodorant.,
If you wear makeup or use beauty products, pack these.,
Add hair accessories or hair ties if relevant.,
Bring a fresh change of underwear.,
Choose an outfit for the next day of your trip.,
Lay out all the things you have gathered together on your bed or on the floor.,
Zip up or close your bag.",How to Pack an Overnight Bag," The style of pajama will depend on where your overnight stay will be––if it's winter or cold weather, or you are going to a humid place where you're prone to mosquito bites, you'll probably need long-leg and long-sleeve pajamas, and in some cases these may need to be thermal. If it's summer or warm weather, pack short pajamas, a nightie or even a t-shirt and boxer shorts. Pack only one pair of pajamas.


Skip the PJs if you like sleeping in the nude. However, be sure that this will be acceptable where you're staying (and won't be too cold). Also bear in mind that carting along a dressing gown to cover up that nude body may add more weight than taking a pair of PJs.
In some cases, sleeping in your underwear might work at a pinch. Just be sure to put on fresh underwear the next morning.
Borrow something. If you're staying with someone you're close to and who has a similar size to you, perhaps ask if it's okay to borrow a spare pair of their PJs. Only do this with close relatives or friends though, as it could be construed as being too personal otherwise.;
, You'll need a toothbrush, toothpaste and floss for your teeth. A hairbrush for your hair––some compact hairbrushes include a small mirror in the handle to make it easier to see what you look like.


, Smelling fresh the next morning will be guaranteed with this important addition to your bathroom bag.

, Both women and men have their own preferences and it's not hygienic to borrow other people's, so take your own. But keep it pared down––no need to cart your entire beauty selection with you for an overnighter.

, This will enable you to quickly tidy up your hairstyle if you have medium to long hair. You could also bring headbands, and hair gel for boys / men. ], Not something you want to forget, as clean underwear leaves you feeling fresh the next morning.


If you do forget the knickers, turn yesterday's inside out. It's better than nothing, although do change out of them as quickly as you can upon returning home again.

, Take into consideration the likely weather, which should be readily available at your favorite online weather forecaster as it's just the very next day. If possible, aim to only change your first layer above the underwear, such as the t-shirt or shirt. That way, you can wear the same jacket/cardigan and pants/skirt/shorts as the day before. Unless you're a fashionista, this will work just fine for you. (Add a silk scarf to dress it up if needed.)


Don't forget to add shoes if they're going to be different from the ones you're currently wearing.

, Start to pack them into your overnight bag.


Choose an overnight bag that is just large enough to carry your items without squashing them. The smaller you can keep this, the more discreet it will look and the more comfortable it is to carry with you.

Enforce a “lights-out” time.",How to Organize a Preschool Sleepover," At this age, your preschooler would likely do best with only one to three children sleeping over. With more than that, the gathering may become too overwhelming for all the kids., Don’t have children arrive much earlier than dinner time because spending too many hours together can cause kids to get on each other’s nerves.A start time around 5-6 p.m. allows your guests to get settled and then eat dinner without too much downtime., Make sure parents know what time to pick up their children the following morning to avoid having any kids lingering well into the day. You’ll likely be providing them with breakfast, so a pickup time between 10 and 11 a.m. gives you enough time to have them up, fed, and packed when their parents arrive., You can make a physical invitation to hand out if it’s a birthday party or special celebration, but most sleepovers are more casual than this.Consider emailing parents so that they have a reference to look back at later regarding start and end times. But a simple phone call is usually good enough too.


If handing out a paper invitation, avoid doing so in front of other children who aren’t invited to avoid hurt feelings.

, Make sure the invitation includes your name and your child’s name, the start and end times, and your address and phone number. It may be helpful to also include an alternate phone number, like your spouse’s cell phone, in case parents have trouble reaching you., Make it clear if you’ll be supplying pillows, sleeping bags, and blankets for all the children, or if they need to bring their own. Encourage them to bring comfort items like security blankets and stuffed animals.

Consider including a reminder about personal care items like toothbrushes and toothpaste, so that you don’t need to hand out extra toothbrushes to everyone.

, Board games and card games are easy solutions for filling time. But you can also choose a more physical game, like hide-and-seek, charades, or musical chairs. If you have puppets, encourage the children to put on a puppet show, or make your own puppets out of old socks and craft supplies., Plant small items for the children to find around the house or yard. Small rubber dinosaurs, plastic action figures, or mini stuffed animals make for a fun suprise that they could take home with them. Just be sure you buy enough for every child to have one., Encourage the children to get creative by setting up a finger painting station, or tracing cartoon characters with glue and then sprinkling macaroni on it. Try working on a papier mache project together, like making a piñata, and let the kids break it open in the morning., This should be age appropriate and not scary. Show the movie toward the end of the night since it’s an opportunity to have everyone wind down and get into their sleeping bags.Choose a classic Disney movie like The Little Mermaid or The Lion King, or go with something more contemporary like Despicable Me, Finding Nemo, or Frozen.

, Let the kids have fun with prepping their sleeping arrangements. Push large furniture aside and let them build a fort of cushions and blankets in the middle of the room. Then they can place their sleeping bags inside if it’s safe to do so. Or have them make different designs with their sleeping bags on the floor, like a sunburst, triangle, or square., Write down a list of each child’s known allergies, such as peanuts, tree nuts, dairy, eggs, soy, etc. Reference this list when you go to the grocery store to shop for snacks, and read the ingredient lists on all packaging., Not only is this an easy, crowd-pleasing dinner, but it also doubles as an activity for your guests. If you don’t want to make your own dough, English muffins can stand in as the base for their pizzas. Then set up a “buffet” of toppings so that they can pick exactly what they’d like to have., Chips and candy are popular sleepover snacks, but to avoid overloading your guests with salt and sugar, offer healthy options as well. Chop up vegetables and serve them alongside different dips. Swap potato chips out for pita chips. If you’re offering ice cream, slice some fresh fruit to offer as a topping., Don’t give the children sodas or energy drinks, especially right before bed, since this could keep them up far later than you’d like. Offer beverages like water, milk, low-sugar juices, or lemonade., Everyone, including you, will likely be tired the next morning, so plan a simple breakfast. Have a selection of cereals ready, as well as easy-to-peel fruits like clementines or bananas. Make pancakes in large batches and dress them up with fruits, chocolate chips, or whipped cream., You never know when a young child might become homesick and want to leave the party. Make sure parents are prepared to receive your call asking them to come pick up their child.If someone does go home early, offer to have them back for breakfast so that they don’t feel like they missed out on everything.

, An extra sleeping bag and set of pajamas are important to have on hand in case any of the children wet the bed in the middle of the night. And even if you told the other parents what to bring, it’s likely someone will have forgotten a pillow or a toothbrush, so have those ready as well., Communicate to all the kids that the lights will be turned off at a certain time, and that they’re expected to settle down when this happens. Expect that some talking and laughing will continue beyond this time, though if it goes on too long, you may need to remind them that it’s time to sleep.


Preschoolers aren’t accustomed to staying up very late, so select a time that allows them to stay up a little past bedtime, but not too much. For example, if your preschooler is normally in bed by 8 p.m., turn the lights off between 9 and 10 p.m.
If the kids are still loud and hyper well after lights out, go back into the room where they’re sleeping and tell them it’s quiet time. Offer picture books and book lights to those who don’t feel tired enough to sleep, but be firm about the noise.

",How to Make VIP Invitations to Your Slumber Party," Go for glamour, have a black-and-white event, or choose sunglasses, sports cars, or something high tech.

, In addition to where and when and whom to contact, you could remind your V.I.P. guests what to wear or bring, and exactly what the occasion is.

,, You can just fold it in half, or you can learn a bit of origami or envelope-folding. If you'd like your fancy fold to go with your printing or lettering, try it on a piece of plain paper first to find out where to put the letters so they line up with your folding (or fold first, although this could be hard).

, Use stickers, or glue on ribbon or bows, little rhinestones, pop-up cutouts, or anything else cool that you like. Choose decorations that go with your theme.

, Use pinking shears or shaped scrapbook scissors to put a shaped edge on your cards, or add paper or ribbon trim (or both).

, If you don't do too much fancy folding, cut a shaped window in the front cover so that a feature inside peeks through to the front. It could be a simple square or circle or it could be much fancier like a curlicue.

Stick to the cheaper sleeping bags.,
Choose a favorite design.,
Wait for the sales.,
Look online.",How to Pick a Sleeping Bag for Sleepovers1," Good quality sleeping bags intended for camping, back country hiking or expeditions tend to cost a lot of money. There is good reason for this––these bags are intended to endure being put through all sorts of outdoor punishment and they need to keep the wearer warm, sometimes in sub-zero temperatures. For this reason, they're not the ideal choices for your average sleepover or backyard camping night! Instead, look for sleeping bags sold in places such as toy stores, department stores, general sporting goods stores, bedding stores, and other generalist sellers of soft furnishings.


Don't spend more than you need to. If you want a sleeping bag that works for both hiking trips and sleepovers, then perhaps it's okay to justify spending more but if not, stick to the sleeping bags that act like blankets with a zipper.;
, Many fun sleeping bags have designs, from Disney to pets. Or, they come in interesting patterns and colors. If you don't like designs, stick to plain shades.

, If you want to keep the price down (especially to win over your parents), keep an eye out for sales time. You should be able to get very reasonably priced sleeping bags when sales are on.

, Another way to find cheap sleeping bags is to look for online sellers, including on auction sites. If you're lucky, you might get one through Freecycle but ask your parents for permission first, as they'll need to check out that it's all okay.

Ask your parents if now is a good time to buy a new sleeping bag.

Tell them that you want one for real reasons.",How to Pick a Sleeping Bag for Sleepovers2,", Begging, whining, and crying make you look pathetic.

, Here are some good reasons:


You don't have a sleepover currently, and for sleepovers and camp-outs, you will need one.
The one you have now will get you mad fun of at school and at social places. Your social status can't afford to drop much lower.
It's more hygienic or less hassle than using other people's sheets and blankets.

It is best to ask the people who are coming over for the sleepover for their best snack recipes, as this will mean that everyone will like the snacks which are provided. If you have no ideas of what to do for everyone, look for recipes on cereal boxes, in cooking magazines, etc.

, If one of your friends is allergic to peanuts, don't provide them. On the other hand, if your friends all adore cheese, have several kinds.

, Also if you want something healthier, try fruit trays, or sub sandwiches, that you can purchase at many grocery stores.

",How to Make Invitations for a Sleepover," Figure out exactly how many people, bearing in mind that a sleepover works best with a small group of good friends. Be sure to check in with your parents first to see what they suggest.

, Are you hosting a birthday-sleepover? A Halloween one? A summer-themed one? A Christmas-themed one? Or is it just for fun, with no purpose but to cure you and your friends' boredom? Make sure your guests know what they're coming to!;
,,, Include the address, too. For example, ""Please come to my house at 100 Chocolate Cake street"".

, This includes information such as: What to bring, what you will be eating at the party, and the activities/games that will be played. If your parents are bringing everyone home or picking everyone up before or after the party, make sure to include that.

, RSVP is a French phrase, which stands for ""réspondez, s'il vous plaît."" In English, that just means ""Reply Please."" Your RSVP could be your cellphone number, your home number, or your email address. It is advisable to set a date to RSVP before. For example, ""RSVP Before October 12th.""

, This could include cardstock, colored construction paper, printer paper, or stationary. Get creative! You can also buy some stationary that is aimed toward the theme of your party.

, Don't be afraid to use glitter, rhinestones, feathers, stickers, sparkles, pom-poms, drawings, ink stamps, lots of colors, cut-outs, markers. Choose anything you like to decorate with.

, Write your guest's name and address clearly and legibly on the envelope. You can decorate the envelope, too. Add a stamp and mail them! (Or if you can hand them out discreetly enough, give them at school, but be aware that if someone who wasn't invited finds out, they may be upset.)

, Don't get spotted, striped or pre-messaged cards, as if they are boldly decorated they will not be classy or neat, and the pre-message may not be what you want.

, Include rules that prevent destruction and frustration such as, ""No hitting or pushing, no name-calling, no painting on the walls ,etc."" Your list can be altered depending upon the nature of your guests.

, Include board games too. They are time consuming but interesting and fun.

, They can help to supervise. For example, set up a situation like: You take care of them for half an hour, and then we shift. The little kids can play other games, like games of their choice or organized games such as duck-duck-goose and, ""house"", or Monopoly. Meanwhile older kids can do something else.

, Never overreact. Instead, inquire what the problem is and take the right action, making the conflict end by forcing the fighters to make up. If particular people complain too much, ask them to stop.

,, The best way would be to use them on a tile floor or covered table. Provide smocks for people to wear or ask them to bring old clothing.

, Ask everyone to line up and wash their hands. Now seat the guests as a table or on the tile floor so spills can be cleaned up easily.

, If they need help, offer to help them. Help them one by one, asking them what they would like. Much hassle will be saved this way.

, Let them take pictures with you. Talk to them nicely. This will make them feel better.

, While one or two of them supervise the little kids or they are close enough that you can all keep an eye, do things you would like, such as gossip, make up, singing contests, etc. The possibilities are endless.

, After everyone has brushed their teeth, inquire if they are hungry and tell them what to do if they need anything in the night. Make sure everyone is in bed so as to minimize distraction and play the movie.

, Serve the breakfast carefully, away from a carpet that can get stained easily and quickly.

, What were the good things you did? How could you improve? What were some problems? Make sure to improve.

Don't stress!",How to Throw a Summer Party (Youth)," Make sure you have permission from your legal guardian first, and then pick the date and time. No use having it at the end of summer when it's time for school! And no use in the middle as many of your friends may be away on holiday. Instead, have your party the day after you break up for summer, or on the very same day! Hey, you can even invite your friends round after school and have them sleep over!;
, Who are you going to invite? Is it going to be a mixed party? Or a girls only bash? Boys only? You decide! Make sure you have plenty of friends to enjoy the day away with!

, It's great to have lots of other activities too! Especially if you have a smaller circular pool, not everyone will fit at the same time-depending on how many people you invite! So I always like to have a table-tennis/ping-pong net game, basketball and volleyball all set up! Put out some other plastic toys such as bowling or sand pits! It may seem childish, but it's a lot of fun!

, It's finally summer! Boiling hot days and cool summer nights! Get those sprinklers on, so even when your chilling in the shade - you still get that occasional spritz of mist!

, In fact - go to a store and just buy loads of food in bulk, that way it'll keep your pals going throughout the day (and night if you're having a sleepover) and will probably last you the whole week too! Remember to get drinks as well, the sun can dehydrate you quickly!

, Grab some 99 cent balloons from you local party shop or store in different bright summery colors! Banners, confetti, it all starts here!

, Don't worry too much about everything being perfect because that will make it seem too organized, it's so chill!

, Make sure you also get around and play other games and talk to different people! Hey, you could even make some new friends!

, you don't have school the next day! School's out! When it gets really dark get some lights: Christmas lights or tea lights, candles, whatever! Put them everywhere! Even put some in the pool! (provided no one is swimming). If you can, try to get a hold of some sky lanterns and light them up with your friends. Although, these can be expensive, so you can just set fire to paper instead and watch it float!

, If you have a portable large screen projector, put it outside and watch a chick flick with your gals (or a uni-sex film when you're with the guys!) and watch a film in the garden! With all the lights down and some candlelight, it's a beautiful scene!

, However, make sure some more patio lights and pool lights are on! You don't want someone to ruin your awesome start to summer by banging their head on the ground!

, if you want you could set up a tent with your pals and sleep outside! Or if it's a little chilly, head inside for some wicked midnight fun!

, Make some pancakes with smoothies or milkshakes with different sauces and toppings! Then you could go for a morning dip in the pool! Or you could play the other games set out the day before!

, Go out at around noon (provided you're up by then!) and spend the day in your local city or park. For you Londoners, Hyde Park or Oxford Street is the place to hit! Stay out all evening and catch a film or a movie, or hey, why not both?

, No one's usually around during late night shopping, so it will be almost like having the entire mall or shopping center to yourselves!

, Call your friends parents(or let them call - it would be weird if you called!) and let them know that your friends are on their way home or are ready to be picked up.

, Great thing is, you may be sad your buddy's leaving, but you've got the whole summer! You could have a party like this every week!

Let all the people attending the sleepover that you're going to do an all-nighter.,
Be in an active place.,
Have your guests bring any and all portable electronics.,
Have energy-giving drinks around, like caffeine.,
Have the TV on.,
Don't let anyone lay down.,
Play funny games, such as truth or dare, would you rather, ""s*x, marry, kill"", or charades.,
Don't be afraid to wake people up.,
If somebody says they're tired, have them splash their face with cold water and/or have a glass of soda or coffee.,
Play video games.,
Listen to music.",How to Keep Your Friends Awake for an All Nighter," If you only let them know the night of, they might have already been prepared to sleep, or just weren't ready, or had something important to do the next day. If you let them know beforehand, they can anticipate being awake, which can help them be ready to stay up. This is mental preparation.;
, If you're next to the kitchen or in a room with a 50"" TV, you're in an active place. Rooms with the most light, noise, and/or technology are good places to keep everybody awake. Having easy access to the kitchen helps as well, so you can grab sodas, iced tea, ice cream, cake, coffee, and other sugary and/or caffeinated treats. It's also the best to be as far from parents and snitches or whiny siblings.

, If they have a tablet, an MP3 player, and a phone, have them bring them all. Gaming devices such as DS's, Gameboys (if you still have any), and maybe the Wii U can also be brought. Technology stimulates your brain to keep you energized. If you're on an iPad all night, you most likely won't even feel tired.

, Coffee, energy drinks, soda, iced tea, and root beer floats/ice cream soda are all great sources of energy. You should drink at least a half-glass of one of these every 1-2 hours. Lemonade an juice can also give a smaller, but still effective, amount of sugar (make sure they aren't sugar-free!)

, Watch scary movies, comedies, and adventure movies. Exciting or adrenaline-pumping movies are fantastic. You can also watch similar TV shows. If you have to camp in your room, set up your TV, laptop, or tablet to play Netflix or Hulu somewhere.

, If they lay down, they're in the position for their body to tell them to fall asleep. This also makes a click in their brain that says they're tired. If anyone lays down, they'll probably fall asleep, so don't even let people lean down very far. Horizontal positions are a great, big, giant NO!

, It'll make everyone jump around and laugh, which pumps you up. And, as much of a ""cliché"" this is for sleepovers, have pillow fights! This creates so much activity, it'll probably keep you up for hours.

, Make the penalties - first strike, get woken up. Second strike, get embarrassing sharpie tattoos drawn on your face. Strike three, get ice down your back. This might even keep people awake with fear of getting penalties, or wanting to witness the penalties in action.

, This probably means that they're shutting down and ready for bed. Cold water activates nerves, and caffeine is a gateway to insane. You won't want anyone to say they're asleep. No matter how many times they say they're tired, make them follow through with the rule each time.

, If you or your sibling has a console, play exciting games like Call of Duty, to even Sonic. Bright, grim, or action-packed games are the best for this. Ratchet and Clank is a great adventure game that can keep your attention for hours.

, Party hits or songs in the Billboard Top 100 are the best. Good party songs are ""Can't Hold Us"" by Macklemore, ""We Can't Stop"" or ""Wrecking Ball"" by Miley Cyrus, ""23"" by Mike Wil Made It, ""Roar"" by Katy Perry, and even ""Here's to Never Growing Up"" by Avril Lavigne. If you're streaming through an MP3 player, create a playlist with popular party songs. Hint: if you want to dance to it or sing it out loud, it's a good party song.

Consider lighting.",How to Throw a Summer Backyard Party," If you are having a lot of people over a large backyard is a must. It doesn't have to be your yard. Ask your parents if their yard is larger, join forces with the neighbours and spread the fun across more than one yard. Ask the local authorities if you can spread the party to the lane, road or green space in front or behind your yard if you wish. Backyards are best for backyard parties but the front yard or some communal space can work too. If the summer weather lets you down, you might need an alternative location, your house can work.;
, Invite all your friends. If it is a end-of-school party then a good idea would be to invite all your classmates. The more the merrier. Make it a way to get to know your neighbours if you wish, invite them to your backyard party. Invite your family if appropriate.

, Make sure it is a date where a lot of people will be free. Make sure your invitees know the date, time, and location, i.e., your backyard.

, People will get hungry! Be sure to have a wide variety of food and drinks laid out. Borrow tables if required. Picnic tables and patio furniture are ideal for backyard parties. Consider carefully the pros and cons of taking your dining room furniture out doors. It's probably better to throw a clean white sheet over a trestle table than cart your antique, oak dining table into the garden.

, Try to find games that work for a large group of people, like truth or dare or spin the bottle.

, Use paper plates and plastic cups if you don't like washing up. Make sure you have enough cutlery for everyone. Have a way to keep food a drink cool if required. Some people like to fill a child's paddling pool with ice and water and put all the bottles and cans in that., Having a party without permission never ends well! Make sure you clear all your ideas with your parents before anything is set in stone.

, The guests' own parents might feel better if your parents are in the house should anything go wrong, but you don't want party pooper chaperones hovering over your fun.

, People don't want to be standing around hungry for hours waiting for the coals to start to glow or gnawing on ribs that are burnt on the outside and raw inside., First of all, tidy up. Mow the lawn, sweep the patio, weed the flower beds etc. Get the yard looking neat and tidy. Then, you can add some decorative touches. Use bunting on your garden fence or in any trees. Tie balloons to fences or garden furniture. Cover tables in decorative table cloths. If you have a patio umbrella, gazebo, rose arch or other similar item, decorate it with banners, streamers, flags etc., It's sensible to keep people out of house if they don't need to be in their, this is a backyard party after all., If you'll be in the yard after dark your guests will need to be able to see. Turn on outdoor lights, hang lanterns, float tea lights on your pond, hang candles in jam jars in the trees or use glow sticks and outdoor party lights."

, You're more likely to get a lively discussion if you find a field he or she is passionate about.

, Whether you are arguing from a basis of fact or opinion, neither the teacher nor the class is likely to accept your word over the teacher's without persuasion.

, In the world of academia, this means documented sources. If you disagree with a teacher on a subject such as gun control, for example, you will need to be able to cite statistics relating to violence, injury, gun use, gun ownership, and so forth, from credible sources.

, Rational arguments are more persuasive than heady, emotional ones.

, The most common mistake in any argument is trying to bully over the other person with your viewpoint, a tactic unlikely to work on an accomplished academic (i.e. most teachers). By asking questions and then supplying alternative answers, you control the direction of the argument.

, The point of any discussion with a teacher is to learn something. Maybe you'll stick to your position, or not. Remember you don't ""lose"" if you change your mind.

Think about your feelings so that you can turn them into meaningful statements.
For example, ask yourself, ""Am I feeling embarrassed or like I did something wrong? What was it about my reaction that makes me feel embarrassed? What do I wish I did differently so I wouldn't feel this way?""
Once you can state clearly what you regret about your overreaction, think about how the situation could have went differently. Think about how the conversation might have gone if you hadn’t overreacted.;
, Think about how whatever you said or did affected your teacher. Consider all the stress they might be under, and how much disrespect they might have to put up from students.If your teacher has a reputation for being mean, remember that “good” or “bad” reputations don’t make a teacher good or bad. You wouldn’t want other people to make assumptions about you based on a false reputation.
Think about how difficult it is to be a teacher. It is an incredible challenge to have a classroom full of kids, to be responsible for their wellbeing and education, and to be responsible for meeting a wide variety of educational and performance standards.
Try not to immediately jump to the conclusion that your teacher is just mean. Spend your time considering your own overreaction and how you could have acted differently.
If you do find that you’re experiencing constant problems with a particular teacher and you think you’re being treated unfairly, write down the details of each situation. Talk to a parent, guidance counselor, or other trusted adult for help mediating the situation.

, Use “I” statements to communicate to your teacher that you have thought about what you did or said. Avoid using the word “you” too much in an apology, at least as far as placing responsibility goes. Be specific about why you’re apologizing, and make sure you recognize the fact that you are in the wrong and need to apologize.For example, don’t apologize by saying, “I’m sorry that you feel I was being disrespectful.” Saying “you feel I was disrespectful” places the responsibility on the other person.
Rather, hold yourself accountable by saying, “I’m sorry that I disrespected you in class. It was wrong for me to say that you weren’t a good teacher. I shouldn’t have said something like that at all, let alone in front of the entire class.”

, When you’re making a heartfelt, meaningful apology, don’t use words like “but.” Saying “I’m sorry I did this, but I felt I was in the right” is an attempt to excuse, qualify, or justify your actions. Similarly, avoid using the word “if” when making an apology: don’t say, “I’m sorry if you felt disrespected.”Remember to be specific and hold yourself accountable. Say: “I’m sorry that I mouthed off when you wouldn’t give me an extension on my paper. I overreacted and acted immaturely.”
Instead of excusing your actions, consider offering a reason, while still maintaining what you did was wrong: “I overreacted and was immature when you told me I couldn’t get an extension on my paper. It’s of course no excuse, but I’ve been under a lot of pressure balancing my time between homework and my part-time job.”
To demonstrate that you’re not simply making an excuse, show that you’ve given some thought to how to resolve the situation with better alternatives: “I should have come to you sooner about my time management issues, and I’ll definitely be putting effort into prioritizing my school work in the future.”

, You do want to make a timely apology, but saying you’re sorry right in the moment isn’t the best, especially if you are angry at the teacher. Take a day or two to consider how you overreacted, how you could have handled the situation differently, and to plan out what you want to say to your teacher.If you do feel sorry in the moment, it’s not wrong to say something like, “I’m sorry I just said that. That was really wrong of me.”
All the same, you’re less likely to make a fully developed apology in the moment, so you should still take a day or two to reflect, then follow up with a more thoughtful apology.

, When apologizing to a teacher, it’s best not to apologize in front of the entire class. There are too many distractions and other people in class to make a meaningful, personal apology. Consider going before or after school, going to class early, staying after class, or apologizing during lunch.


If there isn’t an obvious time to make your apology in private, consider writing your teacher an email or using another convenient means to get in touch with them to schedule an appointment. Try writing, “Hello, I’d like to talk privately about how I behaved in class yesterday. Do you have a few minutes in the next day or two for a conversation? Thanks!”

, The best way to apologize is in person. When making an apology face-to-face, be sure to make eye contact and use facial expressions that convey remorse. Remember to listen carefully and don’t interrupt if your teacher offers any feedback or other responses when you make your apology.Practice your apology in the mirror before meeting with your teacher. Make sure your face doesn’t convey anger or defensiveness but rather, communicates sincerity and remorse.

, While apologizing in person is best, you might want to consider writing an apology note if you think you might have any difficulty communicating your remorse face-to-face. If you want to write a meaningful letter of apology, avoid text or email. Think about what you want to say, then handwrite a letter to give to your teacher or leave in their mailbox.Even if you write a great, heartfelt letter, make sure to follow it up with a quick face-to-face conversation.
Try saying, “Did you receive my letter? I wanted to write it out, since I wanted to make sure I could clearly and sincerely apologize. I didn’t want to risk getting jumbled up or tongue tied.”

, You don’t want to turn your apology into another overreaction or argument. Keep your cool, and remember what the purpose of your conversation is. You are there to apologize, to explain what you did wrong, and to show how you intend to act better in the future.


If your teacher says something that gets under your skin, try to brush it off and remember that you were the one that overreacted in the first place.
They might not accept your apology right away, especially if this isn’t your first offense, but that’s not your decision to make. All you can do is be sincere, apologize, then get over it, and hope that your apology is received well., Mumbling can convey that someone else is making you give your apology, or you don't really want to apologize at all. This is why you should enter into the conversation with a plan, having spent some time thinking about how and why you overreacted. Be real, and use direct language spoken in a clear voice to show that you’re not making a fake apology., In addition to making eye contact and using remorseful facial expressions, use your other nonverbal cues to communicate sincerity. Stand up straight, and don’t slouch or otherwise show that you’re disinterested or don’t want to be there apologizing.Try not to cross your arms, as this closes you off and separates you from the other person.
If your teacher responds to your apology by giving you a talk or feedback, show that you understand their point by nodding and saying “yes” or “I understand” when they make natural pauses in their statements.

, The most important part of making a genuine apology is sticking to your word. Once you’ve identified how you overreacted and explained how you can act better in the future, make sure you don’t blow up again in class the next week. Tie your actions to your words and follow through on what you said you’d do when you apologized.Think about what led to your overreaction, not just for the sake of making your apology but for understanding yourself and your emotions. Understand your emotions so you can prevent a future outburst.
Ask yourself if you under a lot of stress, and what causes stress in your life. Does this particular teacher often get under your skin? Are there difficulties at home that are putting too much pressure on you?
When you plan out your apology, keep a draft or bullet points of your apology for your own reference. Keep looking back to the points you wanted to make, and spend some time a few times a week thinking about how you have or haven’t stuck to your word.

, If you have a lot going on and it’s difficult to control your emotions in the heat of the moment, consider talking to someone. Ask your parent, another teacher, coach or activity leader, or some other trusted adult for advice and to get whatever’s bothering you off your chest.


Consider making an appointment with your school’s guidance counselor, or ask a parent or guardian to help you find a therapist or counselor outside of school.

Reflect on what you did wrong.,
Practice ahead of time.,
Find a good time to talk to them.,
Say you are sorry.,
Explain why you are apologizing.,
Take responsibility.,
Don’t make excuses.,
Promise it won’t happen again.,
Have appropriate body language.,
Write your teacher an apology note.,
Ask for forgiveness.",How to Apologize to a Teacher," In order to make your apology sincere, you have to actually understand where you were at fault. There is a difference between being sorry you made your teacher mad and being sorry you did not do the homework that made your teacher mad. Before you apologize take time to reflect on your actions and why you did them. , If you feel really nervous about apologizing to your teacher practice ahead of time. Write down what you want to say and practice in front of the mirror, a trusted friend, sibling, or parent. This way you will be able to get all of the kinks of the apology out before you are in front of the teacher. , Some suitable times to do that would be after class, during lunch, or before or after school. The best time is when your teacher is not busy or trying to teach. It is important that your apology is timely (preferably only a day or two after the incident), not three months after the incident. Ask for a minute of their time: ""Mr. Smith, may I please speak with you for a moment?”

, Don’t talk around the point you might frustrate or confuse your teacher. Start immediately by saying “I am sorry” or “I apologize.” Don't mumble. Speak clearly and make eye contact. Don't look down or glance around the room. , You can’t just simply say you are sorry and expect them to forgive you. Tell them what you are sorry for and your motivation for your actions, if you have any. Be as specific as possible.


Say something like, “Mrs. Peters, I am very sorry for how I behaved yesterday. It was not okay for me to talk loudly to Steve. I should have been paying attention to you teaching.” , Let your teacher know that you know you were in the wrong. Be genuine and sincere and don’t point the finger at someone else. Don’t say something like, “I am sorry for talking loudly with Steve, but it was his fault for talking to me.” Instead say, ""I am sorry for talking to Steve. I should have been listening to you.""
Don’t say “if” in your apology: “I am sorry if I was being disrespectful.” Instead say “I am sorry that I was being disrespectful.” , Admit that what you did was wrong. Don’t try to justify what you did with an excuse. If you are apologizing for not doing your homework, be honest but don’t make excuses. Don’t say: “I am sorry for not doing my homework but I didn’t do it because I had a soccer game yesterday.” Instead say: “I am sorry for not doing my homework. It was my responsibly to find time to get it done.” , End with a promise that you will never repeat the behavior that caused you to apologize again. Intend to follow through with this promise. If you are apologizing for not doing your homework, start making sure to do your homework. If you were talking loudly during class, make sure to correct this behavior. The apology will mean a lot more if it does not have an empty promise on the end. , What makes an apology much more meaningful is when it is in person. This shows that you have courage and allows your teacher to see your face and body language while you apologize. Your body language should show that you are sorry. Don’t put your hands on your hips or cross your arms as if you don’t care about the apology or are trying to challenge your teacher. Be relaxed and make eye contact with your teacher. , You can't replace an in-person apology, but you can add to your apology by giving your teacher a note or card to show you care. A simple note or handmade card saying you are sorry and what you are sorry for will be really appreciated by your teacher. , End your apology with a request for forgiveness. Say something as simple as, “I hope that you can forgive me.” Don’t expect forgiveness. Your teacher might say they forgive you, but if they don’t say that don’t worry about it. They might need time to think about your apology. The important part is that you stop doing whatever you did that made you apologize. Following through with your promise to not do it again might be what they need to forgive you. "

Sit quietly in your seat.,

Be sincere.,
Understand that you don’t have to like everyone.,
Be as polite as you can.,
Say as little as possible.,
Deal with inappropriate behavior accordingly.",How to Act when You Have a Substitute Teacher," Your substitute may introduce themselves and explain why your normal teacher could not be there that day. The substitute may also choose to tell you a bit about themselves, or they may not. When they begin speaking at the beginning of class, give them your full and undivided attention.

This means that you should put away anything you were working on for a different class. You should also put away any cell phones, laptops, tablets, or or other electronic devices that may take your attention away from the teacher.;
, Many substitute teachers will take attendance by calling out the name of each student at the beginning of class. This is because they don’t know the names of everyone and they want to see who is present and who is not. Though some students may try to give the substitute a hard time by making jokes or telling them the wrong name, resist this temptation. Giving them a hard time will only show them that they have to be very strict with you to keep you under control.

When they say your name, simply say “here” and raise your hand so they can find you quickly and easily. If they go around the room asking everyone’s name then say your name clearly and loud enough for them to hear when it is your turn.

, Your teacher likely left behind an assignment for you to complete while they are away. If so, complete the assignment as instructed. If the substitute makes it clear that you are allowed to work with your neighbor on the assignment, then talk quietly. If you are not normally allowed to work together, don’t push the boundaries by trying to work together on the assignment when the substitute is there.

If you need help with the assignment, take it up to the teacher and ask if they can help you with your question. Understand that they may not be able to help you since they don’t normally teach the class. Try to ask your question quietly so that you don’t embarrass them in front of the whole class if they don’t know the answer.

, If your teacher has given you a free-day, then use the time to work on other assignments. If the substitute has said they don’t mind if you talk to one another, then feel free to do so, but keep it quiet. Don’t take this as permission to go crazy.


Sometimes substitute teachers will put on a movie to watch. If you don’t want to watch the movie, you don’t have to, but don’t be disruptive to everyone else. Work on another assignment, or do something quiet like drawing or journalling.

, When the substitute gave you the assignment, they likely explained when you should hand it in. If they instructed you to hand it in as soon as you are finished then bring the assignment up to their desk as soon as you are finished. If they instructed you to hold on to the assignment until the end of class, then leave it lying on your desk until you have been instructed to pass it in.


If the substitute has not made it explicit that you can work together, then don’t share your answers with a classmate. The teacher may think you are cheating, which could cause a lot of problems.
You may also be asked to turn in the assignment when your teacher returns. If this is the case, keep it in your school bag so you don’t lose it.

, Just because you know you have a substitute teacher doesn’t mean you can be late. Even if your normal teacher doesn’t usually get mad if you are late, you should plan to be on time. A strict substitute teacher may send you to the principal if you are late. Even if they don’t send you to the principal, being late to class still gives your substitute teacher a bad first impression.If you are late because, for example, you were finishing up an assignment from a different teacher, ask that teacher if they can give you a note explaining why you were late.
If you have to be late, but aren’t able to get a note to excuse your lateness, apologize to the teacher when you arrive in the classroom and sit down as quickly and quietly as possible in order to avoid being too disruptive.

, If you are on time and waiting for class to begin then sit quietly. If the substitute has not arrived to class yet, you can chat quietly with whoever is sitting next to you, but as soon as they arrive stop talking and wait quietly for them to begin class.Some substitute teachers will feel intimidated walking into a full classroom. If everyone is chatting and ignoring them, it will only make them feel more anxious about taking control of the class. If they can see that you are trying to be respectful and not give them a hard time they will be more relaxed and friendly.

, Sometimes there will be situations where the substitute doesn’t know everything about how things are normally done. If your substitute isn’t sure about something, such as when class normally ends, then help them out. If they don’t know how to work the smart board or the computer offer to help them if you know how.If your substitute teacher has had bad experiences with students in the past they may be a bit distrusting. If the teacher isn’t sure what time class ends raise your hand and politely say what time the class ends. Offer to show them a copy of your class schedule, which will show the beginning and ending time of each class if they seem skeptical about you are telling them.
If the substitute has asked you to stay for some reason wait as instructed. However, you should politely remind them that you have to get to your next class on time.

, This isn’t entirely necessary, but if you think the substitute teacher did a good job let them know by saying, “Thank you for a nice class” as you walk by them on your way out.


They may appreciate this acknowledgment of a job well done more than you think.
If you didn’t enjoy the class or you don’t think they did a good job, don’t have to say anything. Resist the temptation to say something rude. You may be right, but being rude won’t make the situation any better.

, Try to remember that all teachers, even substitute teachers are also human beings. They can usually tell if you are being insincere when you say something, and they don’t enjoy being treated badly. Therefore, when talking with your teacher, be polite and friendly.If you are not normally polite with your teachers, then consider trying to improve your behavior. Think about why you don’t normally treat them with respect. You don’t have to love every teacher you have, but remember that they are there to help you learn. Being rude will only make this more complicated.

, Throughout your life, you will meet many people, and you probably won't like all of them. However, you should try to be courteous even if you don’t really enjoy their company. Doing so will make your life easier because you won’t be having confrontations with everyone you disagree with, and it will make you a more likeable person as well.

For example, one day, when you have a career, you will probably have to work with people that you don’t get along well with. If you are unable to find a way to work with this person you could lose your job so it’s important to find ways to communicate and be courteous with those you don’t like.
This doesn’t mean you have to pretend to be best friends. It does mean that you have to find a way to work together to accomplish the goal at hand. In this case, the goal is to get through the class without causing problems, while also learning any new information or completing any assignments left behind by your teacher.

, This can be difficult with someone you don’t like, but as you grow into an adult you will learn that you have to be civil, even with people you don’t like. Dealing with a substitute teacher you don’t like offers good practice. If they are rude to you, don’t respond by being rude back as this is probably what they are counting on.


When the substitute addresses you, respond politely. Hide your dislike behind your manners.
For example, if the teacher asks you a question, don’t respond by saying something rude. For example, if they ask you something, don’t say, “I don’t know. Why don’t you figure it out?” If you don’t know the answer then say something like, “I’m sorry Mr./Ms. (say the last name of your substitute), but I don’t know the answer.” If possible, offer to try and find the answer.

, If you don’t like the teacher, you may feel tempted to say rude things or give them a hard time simply because you don’t like them. This may give you some satisfaction in the moment, but in the long run it probably won’t be worth it. The substitute may report you to your teacher, which will probably get you in trouble. If you encounter this substitute again, it is unlikely they will have forgotten you and your behavior so they will treat you as a bad student.


This doesn’t mean that you should ignore the teacher if they speak directly to you. If they ask you a question or say something to you, then acknowledge this by answering as politely as possible. However, try to keep the conversation short. If you want to avoid confrontation, then don’t encourage an argument or further discussion by asking a follow-up question or by trying to start a debate with them.

, Although unlikely, if your substitute teacher is threatening students with physical violence or is making inappropriate remarks then you should get help immediately if you fear for your safety or the safety of another student.If you are worried that you or someone else is in danger, leave the classroom immediately. Go to the main office where you can find the principal, the vice-principal, or the secretary. If you can’t find someone there, go into the nearest classroom to tell the teacher there. Explain to them what is going on, and ask them to come help with the situation because you are worried something bad may happen.

"
Ask to borrow a pen or pencil frequently.,
Bring the wrong materials to class.,
Turn in your homework late.",How to Annoy Your Teacher Without Getting in Trouble1," Writing instruments, like pencils and pens are basic necessities in the classroom—you will need to use a pen or pencil at some point throughout the school day. When you forget to bring a pen or pencil to class, you can’t participate in the activities your teacher assigns. Every time you forget a pen or pencil, your teacher will have to lend you a pencil or reluctantly be okay with the fact that you’re not doing your work—both options are highly annoying!


To avoid consequences, bring your own pencil to class a few days out of the week.
Five to ten minutes after everyone else has started working, let your teacher discover that you don’t have a pencil. Your teacher will be frustrated that you didn’t think to ask for a pencil sooner.
Ask your teacher for multiple pencils in one day.;
, Some teachers require students to bring a specific folder, notebook, or book to class every day. Instead of bringing these items to class, intentionally leave them at home or in your locker. When you repeatedly show up to class without the required reading or the course packet, your teacher will become irritated by your frequent forgetfulness.


To avoid punishment, only do this one or two times a week.
If you leave these items in your locker, your teacher may reluctantly allow you to go and get them.
Before you try this, read through your classroom and/or school policy. Forgetting to bring your materials to class may result in consequences.

, Teachers set deadlines for your benefit and theirs. Due dates teach students to plan ahead and manage their time; teachers often set deadlines to correspond with the days they have time to grade papers, tests, and assignments. When you turn in your work late, you disrupt your teacher’s grading schedule.


Be selective about the assignments you turn in late—you still need to maintain a passing grade. Tests, exams, and final projects are usually worth the most points and should not be skipped. Choose to skip a few assignments that are worth very few points.
Turn in your assignments one to two days after the due date.
If you hand the assignment to your teacher, ask them when they will have it graded and in the books. Continue to ask them until they have graded it."
"
Come to class late.,
Ask to use the restroom at inconvenient times.,
Sharpen your pencil frequently.",How to Annoy Your Teacher Without Getting in Trouble2," Teachers expect students to arrive to class on time and ready to learn. When you arrive after the bell, your tardiness may disrupt the teacher’s routine and/or distract your classmates. Increase your teacher’s frustration by:


Talking to other students on the way to your seat.
Asking, “Did I miss anything important?”
Saying, “We don’t do anything in the first five minutes anyways.”
Asking to use the restroom as soon as you sit down.
Don’t come to class late every day. You will quickly surpass the number of tardies allowed at your school. , Teachers establish elaborate bathroom procedures to prevent students from leaving class at inappropriate times. Blatantly ignoring their restroom rules is a great way to get under their skin.


Limit the number of times you do this to avoid repercussions.
Ask to use the restroom immediately after class begins or right before the bell rings.
Ask to use the bathroom in the middle of a lesson.
Ask to use the restroom while your teacher is giving instructions.
Fill out your pass incorrectly., Pencil sharpeners make loud, irritating noises—it is really difficult for students to hear a teacher over the deafening noise of the pencil sharpener. Annoy your teacher (and a few of your classmates) by sharpening your pencil while your instructor is talking.


Take your time sharpening the pencil. Pull it out of the pencil sharpener frequently to check its level of sharpness.
Before returning to your seat, accidentally “break” the pencil so that you have to sharpen it again."
"
Don’t participate in the lesson.,
Act overly excited to participate in class.,
Waste your teacher's time.",How to Annoy Your Teacher Without Getting in Trouble3," Teachers put a lot of time into each lesson so that the content is exciting and accessible to students. Instead of appreciating the effort they put into planning the lesson, you can annoy your teacher by choosing to not to participate in the lesson.


Doodle in a notebook instead of taking notes.
Surf the internet on your tablet or laptop.
Put your head down on your desk and pretend to sleep.
Talk to your classmates while your teacher is talking.
Look at the clock constantly.
If your teachers speaks to you, don’t continue with this behavior. You may get in trouble., Teachers tend to get annoyed with students who frequently draw attention to themselves. Rather than acting calm, cool, and collected, exaggerate your emotional response to the extreme.


When your teacher asks you a question, raise your hand and act extremely eager to answer the question—wave your hand in the air, jump up and down in you seat, scream and screech to get their attention.
If you’re frustrated, don’t just roll your eyes and sigh. Instead, yell something very unoriginal like “Unbelievable!” or “Oh my gosh!”, Teachers try their best to keep their students on task and focused. You can thwart their efforts, and annoy them in the process, with tangents and/or harmless pranks.


When the teacher asks if the class has any questions, raise your hand to offer a comment. Once called on, tell a long, drawn-out, unrelated story.
Waste your teacher’s time by hiding objects they use every day, such as whiteboard markers, remotes, and staplers.
If your teacher starts to get suspicious, take a few weeks off from the prank."
"
Tattle on other students.,
Seek attention from your teacher.,
Be an excellent student with little drive.",How to Annoy Your Teacher Without Getting in Trouble4," While students may view tattling as a helpful, and perhaps even necessary, behavior, teachers do not want to spend their day refereeing every minor dispute. Teachers appreciate students who can handle their own problems and stay out of other people’s business. However, they often won’t punish students for coming to them with petty problems.


Draw your teacher’s attention to minor problems throughout the school day. Tell them when someone isn’t doing their work, sharing, or being kind.
Be careful, because this could get you in trouble with your peers. Snitching and tattling is seen as an unwritten social rule not to do, and if you snitch you could have your reputation ruined., Teacher’s pets are often well mannered, high-performing students. Instead of blatantly acting out, you can annoy your teacher by constantly seeking their attention and approval. You can do this by:


Asking for help even when you clearly understand a concept
Following your teacher around the room
Showing your teacher completed assignments to gain their approval, There is nothing more frustrating to a teacher than a brilliant student who refuses to put adequate effort into an assignment. If your class work comes easily to you, breeze through the assignment and turn it in quickly. When you take a test over the material, turn in a perfect evaluation.


Don't breeze through assignments if you will receive a low grade. If you are capable of doing the work, try your best to complete the assignment quickly, but correctly. "

Talk really slowly.",How to Annoy Your Teachers," This is the single easiest way to annoy your teacher. Most teachers have some distinctive talking style, may pronounce some words outlandishly, or use certain gestures, and emulating them in front of them in a discreet way may upset them. The best way to go about it is to act really sincere as you imitate your teacher, so it may take him or her a little while to catch on to what's happening; your classmates, however, will quickly know the score and will start cracking up.


When your teacher gets angry, just play dumb. Say, ""What? What did I do?"" and shrug your shoulders. Use body language.;
, There are so many great noises you can make to disrupt the classroom — you can make a farting noise, you can scuff your shoes on the ground, you can repeatedly click the top of your pen up and down, or you can clear your throat every few seconds. If these sounds make your classmates rock in laughter, then all the better. If you want to be more subtle, quieter, repetitive noises are also sure to annoy your teacher. Here are some other sounds that may annoy:


Rip a piece of paper an inch at a time. Do this only when your teacher turns toward the board.
Scratch your nails on your desk.
Click your pen or tap your pencil.
Repeatedly sniffle without blowing your nose, or cough.
Scratch your legs loudly.
Hum to yourself.
Drop your pencil multiple times.
Rub things around as if getting something.
Quietly repeat what the teacher is saying as you take notes.

, If your teacher is a bit of a space cadet, then this should work well. If you're watching a movie in class or using the overhead projector, see if you can get a hold of your teacher's remote when he or she isn't looking — this will work best if you can leave a replacement remote that doesn't work in its place. Then, when your teacher isn't looking, turn the TV off, pause it, or change the settings on the projector. This will definitely annoy your teacher and will ruin her lesson — however, don't expect that this won't get you in trouble!


You can either use the remote openly, to have your classmates laughing, or sneak it under your desk so no one knows what you're up to and so that no one can tell on you.

, This works best if you are either in the back of the class or if you are watching a movie in class; all you need to do is put your head down and close your eyes. Nothing is more annoying or disrespectful than falling asleep while your teacher is talking. If you can't actually fall asleep, you can fake it.


You can fold your arms across your desk and get a big smile on your face or snore, making sleep look so appealing that other students want to copy you.
Another annoying thing you can do is to pretend to sleep for a while, and then wake up and ask a bunch of questions that the teacher answered while you were ""sleeping.""

, Another thing you can do to really annoy your teachers is to throw stuff at other students when the teacher isn't looking. You should start small, with objects such as erasers, crumpled paper, pencils, or chalk. You can up the ante a bit and throw a smaller book, an apple, a tennis ball, or even your shoe if you really want to make your teacher mad. You should try to do this when your teacher is turned around and then look all innocent when she turns back to you. Be aware that, depending on what you throw, you could get suspended or charged with assault. Your victim may even retaliate.


For this trick to be most effective, you should get a partner in crime — a student who will throw something back and forth across the classroom with you. Otherwise, you're going to run out of tools pretty fast.

, (Empty a pen's inside and suck on bits of paper, stick them in the ""barrel"" and blow.

, If you want to drive your teacher crazy, start drawing something while she's talking. Make it pretty obvious that you're doodling — this can work great if you're in the front of the class and she sees what you're up to. It'll be even better if she can see that you're doodling but you try to act really interested in what she's saying and pretend to take notes, while you're actually just drawing.


If you really want to be extra annoying, you can even bring in a set of highlighters or colored pencils and go all out. Create a masterpiece in thirty minutes.
You can also show off your drawing to other students in the class, to show your teacher that you really don't care about what's going on.

, Another way that you will annoy your teacher is if you pass notes. You can pass notes to your friends, or just to anyone in the class. Make it clear that you're writing a note by writing it on a notebook on your lap, and then fold the note into a square or a football and throw it to a classmate. If you're reading a note, hold it out in front of your face and laugh, making it really obvious that something other than the class curriculum is cracking you up.


It can be extra annoying if you have a sly smirk on your face while the teacher is talking to let her know that you're writing something funny to your friend.

, Teachers hate when students habitually show up late. Roll into your teacher's class a few minutes late with a shrug and a smug smile on your face; if you apologize, that will annoy your teacher a bit less, unless your apology sounds really insincere. You should not only show up late but look visibly frazzled, dropping your books, running, or taking forever to rummage through your bag to find the right supplies.

, Another way to annoy your teacher is to try to keep as many of the students off task as you can. Ask the others students lots of questions, crack jokes, laugh loudly for no reason, and talk about personal stuff during group work. Distracting other students can disrupt the entire classroom and undoubtedly annoy your teacher.


The important and tricky thing you have to do is to make sure the other students like and respect you, so they go along with what you're doing. If they just think you're obnoxious and roll their eyes any time you talk, then you won't be able to distract them.

, Take out your phone and text people, play Angry Birds, or just look at it every once in a while and smile. You can even look things up on Wikipedia to try to prove your teacher wrong. Your teacher may take your phone away after a little while, but it'll really annoy her while the game lasts. You can also set your alarm to go off during class, making sure that the alarm is as annoying and distracting as possible.


You can annoy your teacher by pretending to be sneaky about using your phone under your desk. Teachers are on to this, and they'll be extra annoyed that you're trying to hide your phone.

, Every teacher has his or her own set of rules, and if you want to be annoying, you should ignore as many as you can without getting sent to the principals office. Even breaking smaller rules can get really annoying. For example, you can get the formatting wrong on your essays or turn in your assignment a day late, acting like you were sure that was the due date. If your teacher has a certain rule about going to the bathroom in the middle of class, try to break it.


When your teacher tells you you've broken a rule, you should act surprised or say something like, ""But that rule makes no sense..."" or, ""That's not how the other teachers do it.""

, Your teacher assumes that you will take notes, write assignments, and use a writing tool during most classes, so showing up empty-handed shows that you really don't care. It'll be extra annoying if you say, ""Anyone have a pencil I can borrow?"" Or, ""I don't have any paper!"" so you completely disrupt the class while getting the materials you need.


You can bring the wrong book to class and laugh loudly, saying, ""I brought the wrong book again!""

, If your teacher is being observed by the principal or a senior teacher, you should try your hardest to be as annoying as you can possibly be. This can mean talking out of turn, showing up really late, or just generally making it look like the classroom is completely chaotic. The more you can make your teacher look bad, the better.

, When you get your exams back, you should complain loudly and contest every single question you got wrong, even if you know that there's no use fighting it. If the answers are multiple choice or very black-and-white, such as the answers on a math test, you should be really insistent, telling your teacher that she's wrong.


You can try to waste your teacher's time after class, asking her to go through every question on the test with you.

, If you are given a long exam, after 10-15 minutes or so, just slam your paper down on your desk or turn it in and say, ""Done!"" You can even say, ""That was easy!"" to be extra annoying. This will make there other students nervous about what was taking them so long and will cause confusion and nervousness. Of course, just be prepared to have your grade suffer — in more ways than one — as a result.

, Teachers get very mad when you pretend you don't care., You may have to annoy your teacher for 20 minutes or 1. Also annoy him/her enough so they get bothered, but not enough to put you in detention. You don't want to get there!, Nothing can drive a teacher crazy faster than talking while she is trying to give a lesson or to explain something. You can whisper to your friends, or even talk openly to your friends. Act like you really don't care that your teacher is trying to give a lesson, or like you don't even notice that your teacher is up there, working hard. It can be even more annoying if you ask one of your classmates a question that your teacher should be the one to answer. This will definitely annoy your teacher, but you won't be able to get away with it for long! It doesn't even matter what you say, it can be anything.


This can be particularly effective when you see that your teacher is low on time and that you'll be able to prevent her from finishing her lesson.

, If you really want to bug your teacher, then you should act like an expert on every topic she brings up – with little or no evidence to back it up. Whenever your teacher is trying to explain something, look really skeptical, like you know she's got it all wrong, even if she's talking about something really basic and obvious. Scrunch up your face as you stare at her until she feels compelled to ask if you have a question. Putting your teacher in constant doubt like this may make her lose her train of thought and bother her.


After your teacher says almost anything, you should say something like, ""Can you explain that?""
If your teacher actually indulges you and tries to explain her point further, you can say something like ""I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.""

, If being a know-it-all isn't annoying enough, you can also waste your teachers time by saying, ""I talked to my dad, and he says something completely different..."" You can also tell her that your old teacher, or even your teacher in another subject, does things differently, implying that other people know the teacher's stuff better than she does. This can be extra annoying if you have a younger teacher who is trying to prove him or herself.


You can reference TV shows or books to say that other scientists or educators know more about the subject than your teacher does. Say something like, ""I saw this show on Discovery Channel that says...""

, Usually asking questions isn't a problem, but it will be frustrating if you can't understand a math equation and ask your teacher to explain it to you for the tenth time. This also works with irrelevant questions such as ""What color was George Washington's hair?"" Try to act really earnest when you ask these questions, so your teacher can't tell if you're just joking around or not; if your teacher thinks you're serious, he or she will try harder to answer your questions.


It may get annoying if you keep asking the teacher questions that she's answered a million times. If she says as much, you can say, ""Oh, really? You covered that? I must not have been paying attention...""







, When he or she is talking about something important, raise your hand and keep making random points that have nothing to do with what he or she is talking about, or ask questions that only make everything more confusing. Interrupting your teacher is really rude and annoying, and it can be even more annoying if you raise your hand and your teacher keeps telling you to wait, to show that you are trying to interrupt her ""politely.""


Talking out of turn, especially if you're just going to crack a joke or distract the class, is annoying under any circumstances.

, If your teacher asks a really basic question, like what the capital of Florida is or what 10 x 15 is, then you should raise your hand and talk at length about your family's trip to Florida or about how you think the number 10 is the most perfect number on earth. When your teacher looks frustrated and confused, talk even more slowly so you really end up taking up way too much time.


Act completely oblivious, like you don't think you've done anything wrong.

, You can annoy your teacher by reading ahead in the textbook and then asking about all the stuff you've read about a week too early. Your teacher will say, ""We haven't gotten to that yet,"" or, ""I'll explain later,"" but you should be really insistent, until you end up confusing all of your classmates.


This can work especially well in an English class, if you read ahead and announce the ending of a book way before the other students know what happened.

, If your friend, or even a random person, is walking by your class after the bell rings, say something like, ""What's up?"" or, ""I'll text you in a minute!"" to show that your mind isn't really on the task at hand. This will annoy your teacher, as it'll show a blatant disregard for his or her rules.

, Raise your hand and answer a question, but mumble a lot, say ""uh"" and ""um,"" and act like you forgot what you were going to say; generally take forever to get to the answer. Talking as slowly as possible, without making it look like you're doing it on purpose, may annoy your teacher.


If you're called on to read, you can try to read very slowly and stumble over words.

Stay out of trouble.,
Do all of your work on time.,
Be as pleasant as possible.,
Ask your teacher what you can do.",How to Annoy a Teacher Who Hates You1," Following the rules and never giving your teacher a reason to punish you is a great way to annoy a teacher who seems to hate you. If you have a teacher who seems to pick on you or punish you for things more often than your classmates, then make sure you never break any rules. This can be hard if some of the rules seem unfair or unnecessary to you, but it is crucial if you want to annoy a teacher who seems to hate you.If you never break any rules, then your teacher will have no reason to call you out and that will be annoying to your teacher.
For example, if you are required to ask for a pass to go to the bathroom, then make sure that you do so. Be as polite as possible when you ask, such as by saying, “Mr. Smith, may I please have the hall pass? I have to go to the bathroom.”
If your teacher does call you out despite never breaking the rules, then this is unfair treatment. Talk to your parents about what is going on.;
, Turning in work late can also give some teachers a reason to punish you or single you out. To ensure that your teachers can’t use this against you, always turn in your homework and other assignments on time.Double check your work as well to be sure that it is complete and correct. This will help you to earn better grades, which will also frustrate a teacher who dislikes you.
You might even try handing in your assignments a bit early to show that you are really on top of things. Just make sure to ask if this is okay with your teacher first. For example, you might say something like, “I finished my paper a bit early. Is it okay if I hand it in early?”

, Smiling and being as pleasant as possible may annoy a teacher who dislikes you. If the teacher is unhappy with his or her circumstances, then it is possible that your teacher may be taking it out on you. But not letting on that anything the teacher says or does is upsetting to you will be annoying to the teacher.If the teacher yells at you, then keep a calm demeanor and avoid yelling back. Speak in a low, calm voice to the teacher. This will be annoying to a teacher who wants to get a rise out of you.
Greet the teacher every day with a smile. Try saying something like, “Good morning, Mrs. Jones! How are you today?” Showing that you are in a great mood (even if you are not) will be annoying to a teacher who is always in a bad mood.

, Showing personal responsibility may also frustrate a teacher who seems to dislike or hate you. Using “I” statements and asking what you can do about a situation may also help to defuse the teacher’s anger, which will benefit you as well.If your teacher reprimands you or says something to criticize you, then try replying with something like, “What can I do to correct the problem?” or “I want to do something about this. What do you think I should do?”
Responding in a calm, proactive manner will help to show your teacher that you do not want to engage with him or her in a juvenile way. If your teacher truly hates you, then this will be extremely annoying to him or her.

Vent to someone about it.,
Practice conversations with your teacher ahead of time.,
Get help for bullying behavior.,
Consider whether you might just have different personalities.",How to Annoy a Teacher Who Hates You2," If you have been dealing with a teacher who seems to hate you for a while, then it is important to talk about it with someone. Tell a parent, friend, or school counselor what is going on and why it upsets you. Share on a regular basis. Don’t just hold on to your frustration until you can’t take it any more.


You can also try writing about the situation in a journal. Try writing about what your teacher did and how it made you feel every day after school. Keep your journal at home to avoid having it fall into the wrong hands.

, Communicating with a teacher who seems to have it out for you can be stressful and it might be hard to keep your composure. To ensure that you are prepared, try practicing what you want or need to say ahead of time. You can enlist the help of a parent or friend to help you role play the situation.Try having a parent or friend play the part of your teacher. Then, say what you want or need to say to your parent or friend as if that person is the teacher.
Do this multiple times to make sure that you feel ready for the real encounter. You might even ask your teacher or friend to do a worst case scenario role play with you. For example, your parent or friend could yell at you and say things to try to upset you. If you can stay calm and communicate effectively even with the worst case scenario, then you may feel more confident in your ability to talk to your teacher.

, If you feel your teacher dislikes you so much that he or she is bullying you, then it is important to get help. Although it is rare, teachers can sometimes bully their students, which can interfere with your learning and affect your overall well-being.Some things that might be considered bullying by your teacher include yelling at you in front of the class, slamming his or her hand on your desk, calling you names, or using other tactics to upset and embarrass you.
Talk to your parents about the situation. It may be necessary for your parents to have a meeting with the teacher or to talk with the school principal about the situation.
Try saying something like, “I think my teacher might be bullying me.” Then, describe what has been happening to lead you to this conclusion.

, In many cases where teachers seem to dislike their students or vice versa, that issue may simply be that you both have very different personalities.Consider this as a possibility for the problems you are having with your teacher.


For example, if you are an outgoing person and your teacher is a quiet person who prefers solitude, then this could be a reason why you clash. If your teacher loves to read and you hate reading, then this could also be a possible reason why you might clash.
Instead of being frustrated by these differences, you can try to look at the situation as a learning experience. For example, what might you be able to learn from this teacher that you would not learn from someone who shared all of your interests?

Talk with your parents about the teacher.,
Approach the teacher about your concerns.,
Arrange a meeting with your school principal.,
Ask to change to a different class.",How to Annoy a Teacher Who Hates You3," If your problems with this teacher continue despite your best efforts to improve the situation, then you may need to get help. Talk with your parents about the situation first. Tell them in detail what has been going on and what you have done to try and make the situation better.For example, you might tell your parents that your teacher often singles you out in class and punishes you more than other students. Provide some specific examples of when this has happened, such as yesterday afternoon in class or last Thursday before lunch.
If your teacher frequently treats you in a way that you think is unfair, then document it. Write down what the teacher says and does along with the date and time. Keep this log somewhere safe where your teacher will not see it, such as in your backpack. Share the entries with your parents so they know what is going on.

, Your parents may decide to arrange a meeting with your teacher to discuss the issues you have raised. This meeting may happen with or without you present. Either way, you may want to speak to your teacher ahead of time to let him or her know that you want to improve the relationship between the two of you.Showing that you are willing to work for a better relationship with your teacher may cause him or her to ease up. Try saying something like, “My education is important to me and I want to do all that I can to promote a positive educational experience for myself. I am willing to make changes to the way I behave to make that possible.”

, If your teacher still does not change despite talking with him or her, then you may need to go up to the next level. Arrange a meeting with your school’s principal next to discuss what has been happening.Be sure to provide lots of details and explain what you have done to try to improve the situation, such as changing your behavior or talking with your teacher.
The school principal may also meet with the teacher to discuss what has been happening and to get both sides of the story.

, If meeting with your school principal does not change the way the teacher treats you, then you may need to request a class change. This may be the best way to improve your situation.Talk with your parents and your school principal if you think that a class change might help.

Learn how your school defines cheating.,
Determine the evidence against you.,
Have a single story.,
Schedule a meeting with your teacher.,
Prepare for the meeting.,
Inquire about your rights.,
Own up to your actions.,
Ask for help.,
Ask for extra credit.,
Show remorse.,
Face the punishment.,
Make a plan to move past cheating.,
Think about why you cheated.,
Learn from your mistakes.",How to Admit to a Teacher That You've Cheated," Many schools have academic codes of conduct outlining specific policies concerning cheating. Some academic policies separate cheating on a test from plagiarism. Before admitting to academic wrongdoing of any kind, define your actions and look up the potential consequences.


Cheating is usually defined as copying or sharing answers, using concealed information during an exam, or submitting the same assignment for multiple classes. Plagiarism is generally considered to be using materials created by another a person without permission or citation. Some schools take a harder stance on plagiarism and may even define it as paraphrasing another person’s viewpoint as your own.;
, Even if you were inclined to deny the allegations, it will be difficult if a teacher saw you copying answers or using hidden materials during an exam. If a teacher only has a suspicion that you engaged in academic wrongdoing, you may be able to deny the allegations.

, It will appear suspicious if you tell different teachers or school authorities varied versions of your story. Decide what you are going to say and stick with it. This will make you appear more credible. For example, if you tell your teacher you cheated because you didn't study, it won't help your case to tell the principal you cheated because the teacher is a tough grader.

, Set up a time to have a one-on-one meeting with your teacher to discuss the cheating allegations. If the teacher already suspects you of cheating, you may want to say the meeting is specifically about cheating in advance. You could say: ""Would it be possible to meet with you sometime this week? I would like to discuss an important matter about my approach to the last test with you.""

, Go over the evidence the school has against you and work out some key points to say, such as how you plan to move forward from the incident. Learn as much as possible about the academic code of conduct at your school and the potential consequences of your actions. Many schools will have a written protocol that you can consult to learn about the consequences., You can do this by asking your teacher directly or reading your school's code of conduct. Some schools have very serious consequences for cheating and plagiarism, including suspension or expulsion. In most cases, there will need to be a hearing before you can be suspended for more than 10 days or expelled., Don’t try to dodge the issue if you cheated and your teacher caught you because it likely will not prevent you from getting into trouble. Instead, explain why you cheated. Be clear about why you made that choice. For example, if you didn't have time to study or couldn't grasp the material, be straightforward about it. You can say something like, ""I made the choice to cheat because I didn't have time to study, which was in error. Next time, I will give myself more time to properly prepare.""


Be clear about which assignment or test you cheated on. If it was just on one assignment, you will want to clarify that you did not cheat on other assignments. Be aware that your teacher will probably want to review your previous work or keep a closer eye on your future work to make sure cheating is truly a one-time incident.

, If you cheated because you were struggling in the class, tell the teacher you need some additional help in the subject. Be specific about which elements of the course material you don't understand. They may be able to recommend a tutor or some additional resources.


You could say: ""I am not sure I understand how to measure the surface area. This was one of the reasons why I cheated on the test. Do you know of any tutors who might be able to help me understand this topic?""

, If you received a failing grade for cheating on a test or assignment, ask for a makeup assignment or extra credit work to start salvaging your grade. Your teacher might be able to give you a make-up assignment or have you do more problems than other students so that you can catch up.

, Being apologetic may lessen the consequences and punishment from cheating, but you will need to be genuine. You will need to take personal responsibility to move on from the incident. Tell your teacher the cheating was out of character for you and not something you intend to do again in the future. Although you will still likely be punished for cheating or plagiarizing, being remorseful can help minimize the lasting effects to your academic reputation.You could say: ""I am very sorry that I cheated on last week's test. I understand that this was a wrongdoing and that my actions have consequences that I will need to face. At the same time I also want to reassure you that this was a one-time incident and it will not happen again.""

, Accept whatever the punishment is. It may be suspension, detention, or a failing grade on the test or assignment.


Don’t argue. Trying to talk your way out of the punishment likely won’t make a difference and your teacher may add on. Arguing will detract from showing remorse for your actions.
Stay positive. Keep your head up while serving your punishment. Treat it as a learning experience and move forward. It will also show your teachers you are serious about recovering from the incident and you don’t plan to cheat in the future.

, Collaborate with your teacher to get extra credit or make up for failing grades.


Produce quality work. Whatever the extra assignment is, study and focus to turn in a quality assignment. Work on it as soon as possible. This can help salvage your grade in the class.

, An important way to Deal with getting caught cheating in a test is to determine why you did it. This will require some self-reflection. Consider whether you were running short on time or you did not understand the material. Knowing this can help you avoid the same situation in the future.

, After identifying the cause for your cheating or plagiarism, reflect on it. If it was from a lack of studying, work harder or see a tutor in the future. If you didn’t leave yourself enough time to prepare for an assignment, schedule time to work further in advance.

Send a handwritten note.,
Choose your thank you card.,
Address them properly.,
Specify why you appreciate them.,
Keep it professional.",How to Thank Your Teachers1," A physical card is much nicer than only sending an email to say thank you. It’s a more personal gesture and it is more meaningful than an ecard or email. It will also give your teacher a physical keepsake to remember their old students by.If you aren’t sure of your teacher’s mailing address, then you might need to do some investigating. Some options to try for locating the address include contacting the school directly or contacting the alumni or local teacher's associations. If the teacher you’re thanking is a high school teacher, then you can simply address the card to your teacher at the school’s address, which will be available on the main page of the school’s website.
If you’re thanking a former college professor, then things get a little trickier. You’ll need to either call the office of the department in which your professor teaches to find out their specific mailing address or search the school’s website to find out the address of a particular department. For example, if you want to thank your former Political Science professor, then you will need to call or search the website of that department to find the correct mailing address for your professor. Do not send the card to the general university mailing address, as that is for school administrators, not faculty.
College faculty are often very mobile, more so than K-12 teachers, so they might not still be teaching at the school where they taught you. If this is the case, you can contact the department office and ask for a forwarding address for them.
You can also hand-deliver your card on the last day of class if you wouldn’t feel awkward about it and you’re still geographically close enough to do so.;
, When you go shopping for a thank you card, keep in mind what you want to convey with your card. Do you want it to be serious or would you prefer a more playful message and design? Make sure the tone of your thank you card is appropriate for the relationship you have with your teacher. If you’re unsure, err on the side of caution. You’ll be personalizing the card, so pictures on the card are less important., Your card should begin with ""Dear ."" To ensure that your thank you note doesn't feel stiff or sound strange, address your teacher the way you addressed them in class. For example, use ""Ms. Smith,"" ""Dr. Jones,"" or ""Amy,"" depending on how you referred to them in class.Likewise, if your college professor has their doctorate, use “Dr.” and not “Mr.” or “Mrs.” If you’re unsure of their proper title, this will require some research on your part. Check out the university department’s website. There is usually a faculty page with brief biographies and resumes that will let you know whether “Dr.” is the right title to use.

, Teachers love to get positive feedback from their students, so you should let them know specifically what they did that endeared them to you.For example, did they stay after class to help you understand some course material better? Did they make an ordinary lecture interesting or inspiring? Were they flexible or understanding when you had personal issues during the school year? Be sure to say thank you, but also make sure to include specifics.

, Begin your letter with “Dear ” and make sure that you use proper grammar and punctuation throughout. Avoid using “hey” as your greeting because that’s not a respectful, professional greeting. If you’re worried you’ll make a mistake while writing, try writing your message on a separate piece of paper and then transcribing it onto the card. This way you can avoid having to scribble out or white-out over mistakes."

Consider giving a homemade gift.,
Avoid gifting personal items.,
Donate to their classroom.,
Consider a gift card if you’re not sure what to give.",How to Thank Your Teachers2," You don’t need to feel like your gift needs to be expensive or extravagant. Giving a gift to your teacher to say thank you is already going above and beyond, so think about giving a handmade gift. Gifts that represent an inside joke or are from a favorite local business are great choices.


Think about what would be easiest for you to give. If you’re good at baking, try making cookies or cupcakes for them. Or, if you are creative and had them for a year long high school class, you might make a scrapbook or a photobook of your time in their class., Even if you feel like you bonded with your teacher, don’t gift them personal items like perfumes or bath products. This can turn the gift from thoughtful to awkward quickly. Also avoid scented items like candles, as those are extremely taste-specific, and you might guess wrong, leaving your teacher with a scented candle they can't use., If you can, a good way to show your appreciation to a K-12 teacher is to donate something back to their classroom. This doesn’t have to be monetary. You can donate some classroom supplies or you can donate your time. Volunteering to help them clean out their classroom or to help them with student projects is a great way to show your appreciation., If you aren’t close enough to your teacher or professor to know exactly what to give them, a gift card of a small amount to somewhere like Amazon, Starbucks, or a local shop or restaurant is always a safe bet. Don’t give a huge amount because that’s inappropriate for a gesture of thanks for a teacher.Giving your teacher a gift as a way of saying thank you is definitely a situation where the old saying “it’s the thought that counts” applies. The fact that you even made the effort is what they’ll remember, not the precise dollar amount of your gift or gift card. Shoot for $20 or less as a general rule, and even a $5 gift card would be appreciated.

Give your teacher a positive evaluation.,
Nominate them for a student-voted award.,
Recommend them to others.,
Dedicate an accomplishment to them.",How to Thank Your Teachers3," In college courses, teacher evaluations carry a lot of weight toward professors winning awards, receiving tenure, or simply feeling that they do a good job. An anonymous but impactful way to thank your teacher is to leave them a detailed positive evaluation specifying exactly what you loved about their course and what their dedication meant to you., Many schools have superlative awards like ""Favorite Teacher"" or ""Best Art Teacher."" Colleges have similar awards that are partially student voted or nominated like “Outstanding Physics Department Faculty” or ""Outstanding Adjunct Faculty."" Do some investigative work if your teacher really went above and beyond and nominate them for an award. This will mean a lot to them and is a great way to thank them.

, If you loved a particular teacher or course, let others know! High enrollments in classes are often due to positive word of mouth, and this tells your teacher that they are doing something right. Even though this is an indirect thank you, student interest in classes matters to teachers at the high school and college levels. Spreading the word that they’re a great teacher will help them in this area and is a great way to show your appreciation., This is especially applicable in college where you’re likely to have a major project or paper as part of your curriculum. Usually you can dedicate these to someone of your choice. If you had a teacher who influenced your choice of major, specialization, or direction in college, then you might want to consider dedicating a college accomplishment to them.For example, if you had a History teacher, high school or college, who really got you interested in the Battle of Gettysburg and you end up writing your senior thesis or Master’s thesis on that subject, then it would be appropriate (but not required!) for you to dedicate that project to them. This is a great way to show your teacher not only that you appreciate them, but also that what you learned in their class stuck with you over the years.

If you don't get to choose your room-mates and it's someone you don't like, just keep to your side, or try to get along! You don't want fighting ruining a great memory.

Most of the time you can bring a cell phone, so keep emergency numbers in your contacts. Don't forget your charger! You may need to bring a blanket, pillow and/or sleeping bag, so make sure it's warm! Don't forget your little teddy bear! Tell your parents everything about your trip, so they'll be reassured of your safety.
Create a check-list to help keep track of things you have, and things you need to purchase! Check the weather and the conditions so you know what to wear!



 


Always make sure to check with teachers if it's okay to bring your iPod, MP3, cell phone etc. Some schools won't allow it, and it may be taken away until the trip is over.
A few days before the trip look at the weather forecast for the days your trip is on. If the weather is rainy, you'll need to bring a poncho, some rubber boots and some old clothes that it doesn't matter if they get muddy or wet. If it's sunny, be sure to take sunglasses, sunscreen and lots of shorts and t-shirts. Also, always take sweaters and long pants (preferably not jeans). You never know when it might get cold outside. Bring a pair of good sneakers. And for pajamas, bring some long pants and a few t-shirts. And always bring at least 2 extra pairs of socks and 3 extra pairs of underwear.
The most important thing to take with you is a suitcase. A duffel or a backpack is a good type of suitcase to bring, if your school is using a bus to get to your destination, because it is easier to fit into bus compartments. However, if you will be doing a bit of walking while carrying you suitcase, it is good to have something with wheels, so a rolling duffel or backpack would be the ideal bag in that case.

, Soap, body wash, shampoo & conditioner, toothbrush, toothpaste, tongue cleaner, mouthwash, floss, body lotion/moisturizer, facial cleanser, bath puff, facial washcloth/rotating head, deodorant, perfume, facial moisturizer, pads/tampons, shaving cream, razors, hair products, 3 towels (at least), hair dryer, flat iron/curler, hair accessories, makeup (don't overdo it; just bb cream and mascara, or maybe a little more), sunscreen, tweezers, jewelry, medicine, nail files/clips, cotton swabs, bandages, baby powder, hand sanitizer, pain relievers, hairbrush, comb, lip balm, shower cap, tissues, allergy medication & more. A lot eh? It's much better to have more, than less.


For make-up, hair products, toiletries etc. bring them in a plastic bag. That way nothing will leak out all over the rest of your luggage. Pack one bottle of shampoo, conditioner if you'd like, a minimal amount of make-up, tampons/pads (even if you haven't started, just in case), a hair dryer if you're allowed, hairbrush, toothbrush, toothpaste and whatever else you use to get ready. You can also transfer your toiletries into a travel size bottle.

, Have one outfit per day, plus one extra outfit, just in case. If it's only for a few days, you should only need one set of pajamas, but if luggage space isn't a problem, you can pack an extra set of PJs as well. Better safe than sorry! Pack rain boots or snow boots if it's fall, winter or spring. Don't forget the necessities! Panties, boxers, socks, bras, tank tops and more, try bringing a weeks worth! Always bring a pair (or 2) of stockings to wear under your sweatpants or jeans! It keeps you much warmer! Always bring a jacket, hats, scarves & gloves (if it's cold) for warmth! Bring an extra sweater, no matter what! Bring a swimsuit, just in case!

, Other things. Phones, MP3 players, cameras and iPods might or might not be allowed. Don't worry though! Your field trip will be tons of fun! Charge them the night before & buy extra batteries, you never know! Bring money, always! Bring at least 50 bucks if you know you're going to buy lunch! Don't forget teddy (again!)! Bring a water bottle (hopefully reusable!) Bring a bag for messy clothes! Don't forget your running shoes!

, Bring your binder & an extra pencil for anything you need to write down. Talk to your friends about saving you a seat! You don't want to end up with an enemy or a teacher! Plan early! Most kids love to sit at the back, so get to the front of the line first! Pack a snack if you get hungry! Set your alarm!

, Obviously you can't act the way you act at home here (most of our behaviour is too ridiculous for anyone to see!). Sometimes, you might want to step up the class here (brushing your teeth every hour or combing your hair every minute). When you're eating, eat with manners & politely. Clean up after yourself, because if you're a slob in your room, no one will want to be your room-mate again! Play some minor pranks! Don't go over the top, because the teachers will catch you as your friends (or victims) may tattle! Stay neat. Wake up early all the time! Mum isn't here to wake you up! Also, set an alarm! Call your parents every night so they know you're okay! When showering, don't use all the warm water, otherwise your room mates may get really mad! Stay up all night if you want, but beware, you'll definitely be tired! Put all your valuables in a super safe spot!

Determine the educational goals of the trip.,
Consider the age and learning abilities of your students.,
Make a list of potential sites.,
Contact potential sites.,
Choose an affordable destination.,
Decide on a location.",How to Plan a Class Field Trip1," The first thing that needs to be done when planning a class trip is to determine how the trip will support the educational curriculum of the course. Ask yourself “How will this trip enhance the classroom program?” For example, you will not get approval if you want to take a science class to a historic monument, despite the fact that a monument is educational. Consider the following:


Learning outcomes of the trip.
Key vocabulary that will be used and taught during the trip.
Major concepts that will be taught.;
, When selecting a destination for a field trip it is important to keep the class curriculum and learning objectives in mind. You should also consider the age and learning abilities of the students in your class.For instance, an overnight ropes course to learn cooperation is not suitable for students in the second grade.
Young children will not be able to physically complete a ropes course and they are too young to attend an overnight trip.

, Once you have clearly determined the learning objectives of the trip and assessed the age and learning abilities of the students in your class, make a list of potential field trip destinations. For example, if you are teaching an 8th grade health class you could consider the following sites:


Grocery store: Perform a nutritional scavenger hunt. Ask students to read food labels and create a weekly meal plan that would adequately meet their nutritional needs.
Local restaurant: Learn to cook a nutritional and well balanced meal at a local restaurant.
Farm in the area: Visit a farm and learn how livestock are raised, fed, and distributed to customers.

, Once you have created a list of potential sites for your field trip, you should contact them and learn more details about the programs and educational activities they offer. Some places will have pre-trip information packages that they can provide. It is also important to find out the available dates and times, and admission costs associated with each siteYou should also ask the site how many students they can accommodate. You want to make sure that they can handle the size of your group.
This additional information will help you to narrow down your list and ultimately select a site.

, When deciding on a location for a class trip, you should take into consideration the cost of the trip. You want to make sure that it is not too expensive so that most students in your class will be able to attend. You do not want your students to miss out on an important learning activity because they can’t afford to attend a class trip. Here are a few suggestions to cut down costs:


Choose a local site to cut down transportation costs.
Find a site that allows students to bring their own food and snacks so they don’t need to spend money on lunch or food.

, Choose a location that meets all of the criteria you have outlined throughout your selection process. The site should meet all learning objectives, provide appropriate activities for the age and learning abilities of your students, be able to accommodate the number of students in your class, and be reasonably priced.


Once you have officially selected a destination, you should get the name, phone number, and email address for a contact person at the site. This will make it easier to book the trip, once you have received the necessary approval.

"
"
Talk with the principal of your school.,
Obtain permission from your school board.,
Gain parental permission for each student.,
Ask parents to fill out medical release forms.",How to Plan a Class Field Trip2," Once you have decided upon a suitable field trip location and determined all of the learning objectives, you should speak with the principal of your school in order to gain permission. Explain the educational value and the relationship to the curriculum of the grade level(s) that will attend.You will also want to clarify the date with the principal in order to ensure that the class trip does not conflict with any other mandatory school activities.

, Speak with a representative from your school board in order to gain access to standardized letters for parental permission as well as the standard trip planning package. If your school board has a trip planning package you will need to fill out all of the forms included in the planning package in order to get permission from the superintendent.This will vary between school boards. Talk with the principal or a senior colleague to determine the exact requirements associated with taking a class on a field trip.

, Each parent will also need to fill out a permission form in order for their child to attend the class trip. Permission forms should be sent out well in advance of the trip date in order to give families time to read over the forms, pay any costs associated, and arrange their schedules accordingly. Things to include on a permission form are:Date and location of field trip as well as all transportation arrangements.
Educational purpose of the field trip.
Cost associated with the trip and date the money needs to be submitted.
Information about meal arrangements.
Trip schedule or list of activities for the day.
Place for parental signature and contact information.

, If you are not travelling with an insurance company, you should ask parents to fill out a separate medical form which includes information regarding student health, medical insurance, and parental permission for medical treatment if required. Your school board may provide a standard form for medical releases or you can conduct an internet search for “medical release forms.”"
"
Finalize your reservations for the group.,
Arrange for transportation to and from the field trip.,
Conduct a pre-visit to the site.,
Recruit chaperones.,
Compile all of the necessary paperwork into a single binder or database.,
Take careful attendance on the day of the trip.,
Make alternate arrangements for the students who do not go on the trip.",How to Plan a Class Field Trip3," Once you have received permission from the school and school board, you will need to finalize the reservation with the site. You will also need to be in touch with them again once you have final numbers after receiving all student permission forms.

, Schools usually have different systems for organizing buses and transportation for field trips. You will either use an outside contractor or the regular school board buses. If you are using buses through the school board you will need to make sure that the field trip does not interfere with the bus driver’s regular scheduled route.Regardless of the type of bus you use, you will need to clearly communicate to the driver the proper addresses and times for pickup and drop off.
You should also introduce yourself as the class leader on the day of the trip and thank the bus driver for their work.

, Most field trip venues will allow teachers to visit the site in advance free of charge. This will allow you to familiarize yourself with the site and scheduled activities, meet the staff, and learn where the washrooms are located. You may also want to take pictures of some of the exhibits to show to your students prior the field trip.Explore some of the exhibits and activities that your class will be visiting in order to come up with ideas for pre-trip class room activities.

, Depending on the size of your class and the requirements of the venue you may need to ask for volunteer chaperones. Parents or family members of your students make great chaperones. You may also be able to ask a colleague or administrator at the school to help out with chaperoning duties.Once you have acquired enough adult chaperones, you should provide them with any behavioural guidelines and a detailed schedule for the trip.
Do not assume that adults will intuitively know what is expected of them.

, Throughout the planning process you have likely accumulated a large amount of paperwork that you may need to access on the day of the trip. Compile the following forms and information into a single binder or store it electronically on your tablet or cellphone:Signed permission forms.
Student medical and insurance information.
Parent/guardian emergency contact information for that day.
Extra money in case of an emergency.
Checklist of all students and chaperones in attendance.
List of students who must take medication during the trip.

, You will need to have a clear idea of exactly who is attending the field trip and you will also need to communicate this information to the following people:


The school office: Provide a list all of the children attending the trip, the children absent that day, the children who will remain at the school and their location, and a cell phone number where you can be reached.
Chaperones: Provide a comprehensive class list, a list of each subgroup, and the name of the supervisor for each group.
Teachers: Provide a master list of all the groups, all the buddy partnerships, the parent contact information, the student health and insurance information, and the school phone number.

, Ideally, all children in the class will attend the trip because it is part of the instructional day. However, some students will not be able to attend, for various reasons. Make sure that you provide these students with fun activities to engage in while they remain at school. If possible try and provide them with a similar experience.


For example, you could have them complete an online scavenger hunt by researching a similar topic to that being covered on the class trip.
Be creative and try and come up with a fun activity for these students.

"
"
Integrate the trip into classroom lessons.,
Explain all activities prior to the trip.,
Communicate behavioural expectations.,
Discuss safety with your class.,
Send a letter home providing students with additional information about the trip.",How to Plan a Class Field Trip4," Studies have shown that students who receive pre-trip instructions and lessons learn and retain more from the trip than those who had no pre-trip preparation. For example, if you are doing a unit on animal habitats and are going to visit a zoo at the end of the unit, you may want to begin by learning about different ecosystems and habitats in the classroom:Have your students study the habitats of a variety of animals they will see at the zoo.
Then ask them to record the features of the habitats that the zoo provides for the same animals.
Have them compare the natural habitats to the constructed zoo habitats to see if they are getting a similar type of lifestyle.

, Prepare your students for the field trip by explaining to them the activities they will be expected to perform throughout the day. Going over a detailed schedule in advance will allow students time to prepare.


This will also give you the opportunity to provide any instructions, which will save time on the day of the trip.
You could also brainstorm questions that the class may want to ask of the instructors at the site. Alternately, you could teach your students how to ask thoughtful questions., Discuss all behavioural expectations prior to the trip as well as any and all consequences that students will face if they misbehave. For example, if you are attending a museum you may want to remind students to be quiet, respectful, and avoid touching any of the museum artifacts. Failure to do so, may result in a call home to their parents. By outlining your expectations clearly, you will likely run into less problems on the day.Outline expected behaviour during transit as well. For example, students must remain seated while on the bus and should not distract the bus driver.

, Regardless of the type of trip you are taking you should always clearly outline certain safety precautions in advance. For example, if you are taking a group of young students on a field trip, you should go over traffic safety beforehand.Depending on the type of trip you may want to establish a buddy system or seating plan for safety purposes.
You could also divide the class into smaller groups with adult supervisors and chaperones. This will make it easier to monitor student behaviour.

, Aside from the permission and medical forms, you should also give students more detailed information about the schedule and what they should take with them on the trip. For example, you can include:The destination, with a physical description of the site.
Detailed list of the planned activities.
Any special preparations the parents and students need to make for that day, such as special clothing, boots, lunches, money, sunscreen, gloves, backpacks, water bottles, etc.
The drop off and pick up time for the children, if it differs from the regular school day.
A packing checklist if the trip involves overnight travel.

Don't go overboard and risk getting your items confiscated!;
, Tape a list of items you are bringing to your suitcase to avoid lost items.

, For example, on a trip to a non-English speaking country, it might be wise to bring a foreign language dictionary.

, You can borrow one from a family member, friend, or borrow it from the library.

, Check the weather forecast for your destination and determine what they weather will be like.

If it will be very cold, or snowing, bring a heavy jacket, mittens or gloves, a hat, and waterproofed boots or shoes.






If the weather will be moderate (spring or fall-like temperatures), bring a light jacket and clothing to layer.






If the weather should be hot and sunny, pack light pants and short sleeve shirts. Also consider packing a light jacket for evenings.







, Ask your teacher or chaperon if you will be able to do laundry on your trip. If so, bring a few foreign coins to pay for it.

, It is recommended to bring a collapsible umbrella and a light waterproof jacket, so they can fit in your suitcase or backpack.

, You can also buy one at your location. Remember to bring any phone numbers you might need to remember.

If you have access to WiFi at your destination, you can also catch up with them via video calling or instant messaging,







, Even people who have never been homesick can feel homesick when in a different country.

, If you are bringing a diary, it is best to find a place to hide it, if you are sharing a room with other people. Bonus points if your diary has a lock

, You may find yourself taking as many as 50 photos a day.

, Your trip won't cover that, so you will need traveler's checks or something like a debit card which can be used to get cash from an ATM machine. You might also want to get some money from your local bank in your destination's currency before you leave, or trade them at a currency exchange.
, Many hotels provide soap and shampoo for free. Try to get travel sized toiletries or transfer your existing toiletries into a travel sized bottle.

, You might want to include snacks, a book, a music player, or even small travel games. If you can, check the website of the airplane your class is going on so you can know what they offer.

Depending on where you’re traveling to, the weather might be completely different from where you’re coming from.Use a site like Weather.com to figure out the projected weather forecast for the days of your trip.
Look at both the highs and the lows. Temperatures fluctuate throughout the day, so check to see both how warm and cold it will get and pack for both sets of conditions.;
, If you’re going on an overnight trip, you’ll need far fewer outfits than if your trip lasts an entire week. Figure out how long you’ll be away, then plan to pack for that length of time.Plan to pack one extra outfit, in case you spill or have a problem with one of your other outfits.
Plan to pack at least two extra pairs of underwear and socks. They’re small enough that they won’t take up a lot of room, but you’ll miss them if you don’t have them.

, Now that you know how long your trip is and what the weather will be like, it’s time to plan your outfit for each day. Think about the purpose of the trip – are you going to visit museums? Are you competing in a choral competition? Whatever you’re doing, make sure you’re packing clothes that will work for the occasion.Lay all of your outfits on the floor, organized by day of the week. This way, you can see what you’re missing or forgetting.
If you’re going to be doing a lot of walking, pack sneakers or other walking shoes.
If you’re staying in a hotel with a pool, pack a bathing suit.

, Think about all the items you need to bring with you that don’t qualify as clothing. This includes hair and makeup products, bathroom products, such as a toothbrush, toothpaste, and razor, plus any electronics or books you might need to keep you entertained.If you’re going to a competition or festival, make sure you pack any school related items you might need.
If you’re staying at a hotel, you do not need to pack shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel.
Pack some extra feminine hygiene products – you never know when you’re going to need them.

, At this point, you probably have a pile of unpacked items on your floor. Look through the pile and take out anything you don’t envision yourself using.Talk to your friends who are traveling with you so you don’t double up on the same items. If you’re all sharing a room, only one of you needs to bring a hairdryer.
If you accidentally overlook something, you can always purchase it when you arrive at your destination.

, The size of your bag should depend on the length of your stay and the kind of travelling you’ll be doing. If you’re taking a short trip, you can pack your clothes in an overnight bag. For a longer stay, you might want to use a duffle bag or a suitcase with wheels.If you’re going backpacking or hiking, make sure to bring a backpack with you.
If you’re traveling on a plane, check to see if your group will be checking bags. If not, your bag will need to be small enough to fit in an overhead bin.
Try to choose a bag that is brightly colored, so you can easily identify it.
Label your bag with your name and a phone number in case you and your bag get separated.

, You only have a limited amount of room, so make the most of it. Roll your pajamas, T-shirts, and sweaters to save room and cut down on wrinkling. Stick your socks and underwear in your shoes to create more space.Make sure to pack some empty plastic bags. You can use these to hold your laundry and wet bathing suits.
Save a small amount of space in your bag for any souvenirs you might want to bring home.

, On trips, it’s nice to pack a smaller bag with your most prized possessions and the possessions you use the most. This bag should stay with you at all times, even if you check your larger bag.This bag should contain things like your wallet, any forms of ID, your electronics and chargers.
You should also pack one of your outfits in this bag, in case your other bag doesn’t reach your destination at the same time you do.
Include a book, hand cream, lip balm, hair ties, gum and any tickets you might need in this bag as well.

, No matter where you’re going, it’s always good to have some food and water on hand to snack on between meals. Throw some snacks that travel well into your bag, along with a water bottle.Granola bars, fruit snacks and pieces of fruit travel well and are easy to eat on the go.
If you’re traveling on a plane, bring an empty water bottle. You’ll be able to fill it up as soon as you get through security.

, If you’re someone who needs a little beauty rest when you travel, add some earplugs and an eye mask to your bag. If you’re taking a long bus trip, you may want to include a blanket and neck pillow or roll up a soft jacket.If you’re not staying in a hotel, pack your own towel.
If you’re staying somewhere with group showers, pack flip-flops too.

, While most of your trip is probably already paid for, it helps to have cash on hand to pay for food and souvenirs. If you’re traveling on a plane, you’ll also need a state ID, as well as your boarding pass.If you’re traveling internationally, pack your passport.
Pack your student ID, just in case. It may get you a discount on something!

Try to pack in a satchel or backpack and make sure all toiletries can fit in one makeup case or bag. If not a backpack, then the smallest suitcase ever. Chances are there won't be much room where you are going.


Take clothes for all types of weather. If you're staying for a couple of nights.
Don't take too much makeup. You only need concealer, blusher, waterproof mascara, lip balm and perfume.;
, This will give you have something to listen to if you're bored.

,,, You'll be everyone's best friend!

, Both on the bus/car and in your room or cabin at the destination. Bring an iPod (if allowed) and tons of books or paper pads and pencils. Block out the world from your own little bus seat, or maybe talk to some poor soul who needs their own oasis too.

, When you arrive, claim a bunk or bed or loft as yours and make it home. Arrange pillow, books, and sleeping bag exactly how you like them because hey! No parents to tell you otherwise!

, Or, if it suits you, enjoy some alone time on your suspiciously lumpy camp bed, reading. Volleyball is fun, or swimming or the ultimate last resort. Re-imagine movies in your head, that you can't watch now because you are on this trip.

, Drama is bad! It's seriously fun to watch drama go down from a comfy perch on the top bunk, but it is no fun from the middle of everything. So stay out of it, but for extra entertainment it isn't the worst thing to watch. But remember: It is not fun to be involved.

, Don't forget anything because chances are you will not get it back. Get your stuff out for the drive back and keep in your own little bubble, just like the drive there. And, unless the bus wrecks, count yourself lucky. You survived.

, Wear your seat belt if your seat has one fitted.


Sit on your seat properly. Whilst it is tempting to kneel on the seat so you can chat to the person behind you, remember if the bus has to brake very sharply or is hit from behind, you are at risk of being flung the length of the bus.
Don't walk around the bus if traveling by bus. Remain seated.
Avoid distracting the coach driver. Most professional drivers will have encountered their fair share of excitable school children but keep the singing, shouting, fighting and throwing things to a minimum.
Don't distract other road users. Flashing, mooning, making obscene gestures and showing other road users ""amusing"" signs is hilarious until they mess up overtaking your bus because they are distracted, spin out of control and inadvertently cause a vehicle pile up.
Keep emergency exit doors closed. Falling from a vehicle traveling at only a few miles an hour can result in serious injuries and if you or one of your classmates is unfortunate enough to be run over after falling from the bus or coach, death is a strong possibility.

, Listen carefully to the instructions provided by the instructor and teacher. Do not be afraid to point out any problems that you see, such as weather issues, equipment problems and unusual things you've spotted. It is better to raise these things and have them explained or assessed, than to not speak up and have a problem occur.

",How to Pack for a Field Trip," Ask what you will need on the field trip (and what you won't need). Also, write a list of the things you want to bring personally. Once that is done, cross out anything that wouldn't make sense to bring and add anything that you forgot.


A checklist is useful for this as you can tick items once you've packed them.
When it's only a day's field trip, not an overnight trip, you don't need a lot. On the other hand, if it's a week long or more field trip, you'll obviously need to plan in greater detail.;
, It'll need to be large enough to fit everything but still the right size and weight for you to manage. If you're buying it for the first time, get the retail assistant to help you load bags and walk around with them on, to get a feel for the bag plus weight. If must be a tolerable weight if you're walking a lot, or doing a lot of physical activities.

, If not, here are some things to consider:


Backpack (see above)
Backpack liner if rain is likely to be an issue or you'll be traversing fords or wading in mud or swamps; if you do fall, a waterproof liner wrapped around your items will protect them from waterlogging
Writing equipment (paper, notebook, pens, pencils, paints, etc.)
Measuring instruments (as required)
Digital camera
Tablet (this may be useful for documenting things, if you're used to using it; make sure it's fully charged though)
Flashlight
Modeling clay (for impressions, models, etc.)
Cellphone (again, check that it's fully charged as there won't be anywhere to charge it out on the field trip)
Sunglasses, hat, sunscreen, insect repellent
Wind jacket/rain jacket
Layers of clothing (if needed)
See a camping list if you're going for an overnight or longer field trip.

, The top of your bed or the floor of your bedroom or perhaps even the bed or floor of a guest bedroom are good places to pack from.

, A fun pack usually includes a pen/pencil and a piece of paper. Then you can bring pocket-sized fun items, such as clay, a mini flashlight, or even your own food (if you are allowed). You can bring in whatever you want, as long as it fits inside a pocket-sized container. If you're going to be security checked, like in the CNN Center, don't bring it. Remember share some things with your classmates.

, You should bring a water bottle and a snack for the ride. Bring a light jacket just in case, if later on in the day it gets chilly.

, The top of your bed or the floor of your bedroom or perhaps even the bed or floor of a guest bedroom are good places to pack from.

, These include a packed lunch, a light foldaway rain jacket in case of rain, a re-useable water bottle with water already in it, sunscreen, chapstick, sunglasses, a spare cardigan, a sun hat and bug spray.

, Don't take a travel neck pillow for the coach because that is a complete waste of space. Ideal extras are things like: a small notebook and pen, a camera, an extra snack and an ice pack in your lunch. Not only does that keep your lunch cool, but if you get too hot you can put it to your forehead to cool you down.

, Put your lunch at the bottom of your bag to keep it cool, then put the extra snack on top, then put the rain jacket, then the camera, then the cardigan then the water bottle tucked down the side so you have it handy, but your keeping it cool, then the notebook and the pen (put the pen in the spiral bind if there is one), then the bug spray, chapstick and sunscreen. Put the hat and sunglasses on, but keep a space at the top of the bag to put it in if you want to take them off. The idea of packing like this is to keep food and drink cool, but keep drinks handy, then protect the camera by putting it between clothes, then having notebooks, pens, sunscreen, chapstick, and bug spray handy at the top. It is best to keep the side pockets, if there is any, free of things in them in case someone takes them. They might even take sunscreen or bug spray because they might not have any and may not be nice enough a person to ask you to borrow some.

Pack a few days ahead.",How to Pack for an Overnight Middle School Trip (for Teenage Girls)," There's nothing worse than getting to the bus with your suitcase packed and finding out you can't go!;
, Know where you're going, how you're getting there, what you're doing there, where you're staying, how long you're staying there, and if there is any dress code. All of this is vital to packing. For example, you need to know if you're riding the bus or taking a plane (planes have strict rules about what you can bring). You need to know what the weather is like where you're going so you can pack the right clothes. These are just a few examples.

, Check what the weather is going to be like. Pack accordingly. If the weather calls for rain, bring a waterproof jacket or a poncho. Cold? Pack gloves, scarves, hats, and a warm winter jacket. Bring one extra outfit than needed. For example, if your trip lasts 3 days, pack 4 outfits. Fuzzy gloves

, Pack your toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, shampoo, conditioner- anything you need to stay clean and fresh. No one wants to share a room with someone who smells like they haven't showered in a week!

, A picture is worth a thousand words, right? Pictures can show where you went, what you saw and experienced, and later on you can look back and remember all the good times you had! But don't bring a really nice professional camera. You might lose it or it could get stolen, just like any other camera, but if you have a really expensive camera, you're out of a lot of money.

, You'll need a phone in case of emergency. You could get lost, especially if you're somewhere that you've never been before. Also, consider bringing an extra battery. You might get some free time during your trip, whip out your phone, and start playing Angry Birds. Then poof- no more battery life. What good is it now? If you have an extra battery, you can just swap the dead battery for the fully charged battery. If you don't have your own personal phone, ask your parents, another family member, or even a friend if they have an extra phone that they can lend you for a few days.

, This can be used for souvenirs, meals, or snacks. Not everything is covered in the original cost, so it's good to have some back-up money.

, This way you're not up at 2 A.M., the morning of the trip, trying to cram a bunch of clothes in your bag.

Pack the right clothing: If you are not sure what the weather would be like for your trip, be prepared for the best and the worst weather.,
Remember all of your toiletries: You will always need toiletries so make sure you have shampoo, conditioner, soap, shower gel, sponge, toothbrush, toothpaste, brush, and comb.,
Bring something to keep you busy.,
If it is in a different language/country you'll be going to, practice and write down some helpful phrases.,
Research some of the culture.",How to Pack for a 4 Day School Trip," Or, you can just check the weather online or in your local newspaper.


It's ideal to pack enough clothes to last the trip. Pack depending on the weather. It's typical to bring an extra pair of pants and an extra shirt.
If you have one, bring your school shirt or trip shirt. It may not be a shirt, but at least be sure to bring the school required article.
Appropriate nightwear. You probably can't sleep in the nude while on the trip, so try grabbing a pair of sleep shorts, pajama pants (fleece for colder nights), and a t-shirt.
Towels for swimming, or for showers. If you're in a hotel, they usually supply towels.
Toiletries (soap, toothbrush, shampoo, etc). Once again, hotels normally supply things like soap, shampoo, and conditioner. Check to make sure that you're allowed to bring hair straighteners/curlers if you plan on packing yours.
Comfortable and warm clothing. It's up to you what you pack for this, but grab a sweatshirt just in case.
Suitable footwear. Don't bring new shoes on the trip, unless you absolutely need to. Always bring a pair of gym shoes/sneakers if you know you'll be walking. Converse or other shoes similar to them are okay, but sometimes don't offer the support in your arches. It's not a good idea to wear heels or wedges. Also, bring a pair of flip-flops if you plan on swimming or using a public shower.
Don't forget your undergarments. Bring two extra pairs of socks and three extra pairs of underwear/boxers. Girls may want an extra bra, and a sports bra too.
It may be warm so, in addition -

Swimsuit (schools might not allow the little Speedos for guys, and thong swimsuits for girls; check to see if you are allowed to wear a bikini.)
Shorts, t-shirts, tank tops, etc. Check to make sure that the clothes apply with the trip's dress code. If there is no dress code, some teachers or supervisors might say to pack things that won't embarrass them with your wearing them. Try to stick to your school dress code, or close to it. (This mainly is for girls, don't wear a bandeau only or shorts that just barely cover your butt. Some guys also can wear too short of shorts.)
Bug repellent - it's a good idea to bring a small bottle of bug spray in you're doing night activities, near water, etc.
Sunscreen to protect from sunburns. Bring along a pair of sunglasses- a pair that has UV protection, and tinted sunglasses are a better preference. Also, don't forget a baseball/snapback hat to shade your face. Don’t forget a water bottle.


It can be cold, so pop in an extra pair of pants or sweatpants. If it's really cold, don't forget a hat and gloves!
Flashlights, with spare unused batteries, you might need a flashlight for at night. Flashlights that require to be shaken to project the light work well.
Insulated insoles (to put an additional set in your shoes if you get cold feet), or take a pair out of some old shoes.
Extra things to suit the weather. Bring a handheld battery-operated fan if it's supposed to be warm. It's always a good idea to bring a windbreaker jacket if it's somewhat windy where you're going. Also, don't forget to bring a foldable umbrella to fit in your bag in case it rains.;
, Some girls will need feminine hygiene products, so pack a few even if you're not on it or haven't gotten it.

, You may get bored on the journey there so here are some ideas: DS, PSP, MP3 player or even a book.

, For example, Aidez-moi s'il vous plait? means Could you help me? Or Où sont les toilettes? means Where are the restrooms?

, On the train in Japan, its considered rude to be on the phone ; In France if you say something to your friend in French, joking about your mum (saying for example Ta mère...) is considered very offensive.

Open up a new document on Microsoft Word for Windows or Pages for Mac.,
Write your title and subtitles.,
Start with clothes.,
Create check boxes.,
Proofread.,
Print your list.,
Follow your list.",How to Make a Packing List for a School Trip," Close all other programs (I.e. Computer games, instant messenger) and focus on the task in front of you-creating your packing list.;
, Your title should be larger than the rest of your writing and underlined. Your subtitles should also be underlined, but they can be the same size as everything else. They should say ""Clothes"", ""Electronics"", ""Hygiene/Beauty"", and ""Miscellaneous"". Your title should be something along the lines of ""My packing list""

, Clothes are one of the hardest parts of the list, but also the most important. Make sure you bring enough outfits for the number of days you're staying as well as an extra in case you spill something. Check the weather before you make your list. If it's going to be hot and sunny, pack mostly shorts and capri shorts. If it's going to snow, don't forget to bring your parka. Always bring warm clothes even if it's supposed to be hot the whole time you're away because weather reports can be wrong. Also don't forget to check your itinerary and make sure to pack clothes for any special events (Ex. Warm clothes for an evening baseball game, a dress for a semi-formal dance, a uniform for a soccer tournament) and don't forget the essentials (socks, underwear, bras, swimsuit...you'd be surprised how many people forget these)


Hygiene/Beauty. This includes deodorant, toothpaste, shampoo, make-up, hair products, and yes...tampons (bring these even if it's not your time of the month just in case a friend or roommate forgot) Go into your bathroom and make a list of all the things you use in a typical week. If you have 7 different eyeshadow compacts and use them all every week, try to cut back and bring just 1 or 2.
Electronics. You're probably going to want a camera for your trip as well as your cell phone, mp3 player and maybe even a portable DVD player or laptop, but all these items are useless unless you bring their chargers and batteries.
Miscellaneous. This is the section for other things you'll need that don't fit into any category (Ex. Pillows, blankets, books, journals, your Teddy bear you can't sleep without...)

, When it comes time to pack, your going to want to check things off as you go. Go into the symbols menu and add little squares beside each item. If you're bringing four shirts, add four boxes.


Colour code. Some things you'll put in your suitcase (Clothes, shampoo) and some things you'll need with you on the bus (iPod, passport). To avoid the hassle of figuring out what goes where while you're packing, colour code your list. Items in blue go in your carry on and red items go in your suitcase.

, Look at your list one last time and tweak anything that needs tweaking. Do you really need six pairs of earrings for a four day trip? And maybe you should bring an extra swimsuit just in case.

, Put it somewhere you won't lose it. Make sure you save it too just in case and leave some extra spaces in each category so you can add things in you've forgotten.

, Make sure you only pack what your list says (unless you forgot to write something) If your list says 4 tees, but you can't decide out of six, don't bring them all. Ask a friend or family member for their opinion on which ones to bring. If you follow your list and your suitcase still won't close, you may need to do some rearranging. Remember, you're gonna wanna buy souvenirs so always leave some extra space in your bag.

, Determine how much can be spent per student or as a group before you make a reservation.

, Check out a few hotels in the area you will be staying and compare rates.


Call the hotels. Many people book hotels online, but when you are making a reservation for a group, it is better to speak to someone so you can explain your needs.
Ask about group discounts. Many hotels offer a reduced rate when you book a group of rooms together.
Find out if there are other perks available in addition to a group rate. These might include upgrades for chaperones or free movies and games in the rooms.

, Once you have compared several hotels, pick one that can accommodate your student group and provide reasonable rates.

, Each hotel has different policies about how much of a deposit is required on group reservations.


Find out when the balance will be due. You might need to pay in full when you check in, or at the time of check out.

, This will help the hotel assign rooms to each guest. If you want to have certain students stay together, indicate how guests should be paired or grouped in the rooms.


Note the names and contact information of the chaperones and other traveling adults.

, Let the hotel know that the students in your group are not permitted to make phone calls, access the mini bar or take advantage of any other amenities you might want to restrict.

,


Ask students to pay attention to dress code, rules, emergency instructions and any other pertinent information in the hotel policies.

, Managing a large group of students can require extra attention from hotel management and staff.


Let the hotel know you appreciate their good service by writing a positive online review or completing a survey card they provide.

, Make sure the movie times accommodate your schedule. You wouldn't watch Lord Of The Rings if you had a dentist appointment in an hour, right?

, Movie theaters are hot and stuffy because of carbon dioxide, so make sure you don't wear anything puffy. A comfortable tee shirt and some jeans are probably the best choice.

, If you are known for being tardy, make sure to set an alarm clock. Your teacher will be angry at you, and you'll risk missing the field trip bus by being late.

, If the movie's 3D, make sure the person gives you your glasses, or else the whole movie will look blurry and you won't enjoy it at all.

, Make sure you brought enough money for all the goodies you want. Some good things to buy are popcorn, soda, candy, nachos, and Icee. But remember, nothing at the movies is cheap. Just the popcorn might cost you $6.00.

, You probably wouldn't want to go during the climax of the movie, and your classmates will be annoyed at you for passing by the screen.

, The last row will probably be the least crowded, so you'll be the most comfortable there. You may also want to sit next to your best friend. It's even better if you and your friend only have each other, because the movie will be better like that. The popular people, however, will be bunched up like sardines in a can. You and your friend will have all the room you want.

, Put yourself in the other children/adults in the theater's shoes. Would you like it if you were an adult trying to watch a movie while 20 school kids are jabbering on about gossip?

, Just sit back, munch your popcorn, and watch the show.

Depending on the game, you’ll probably need at least one other person to play. However, you’ll have more fun if you get as many people involved as possible. In some cases, you may choose to play a game that the entire bus can participate in.If you want to keep it simple, play “20 Questions.” One person thinks of an object or person, and the other players ask questions, all the way up to 20, to try to figure out the answer.
“Telephone” is a fun game for the entire bus. One person starts by whispering a sentence or two to another person, who then tries to repeat it verbatim to a third person -- and so on. The final person says the phrase out loud, so everyone can hear how close it is to what the original person said.
When you’re driving a highway, you can play the “Restaurant/Gas Station/Hotel” game. All the players choose a specific restaurant, gas station, or hotel, such as McDonald’s or Burger King, and you earn a point every time you see the place you’ve chosen or its logo on a road sign. The person with the most points at the end of the allotted time wins.;
, Another fun way to pass the time and involve the entire bus is to sing some bus songs. You can go around the bus and have everyone start a song to get a good variety of music. In some cases, it can be fun to choose a theme, such as songs about driving, Disney songs, or songs with ""trip"" in the title.It's usually best to use current pop songs that most people would know, so no one feels left out.
If you have a school song, you might end or start the sing along with that.

, On a short bus ride, you may not necessarily need a book or electronic device to entertain you. Instead, you can pass the time talking to your friends and catching up on what’s going on with them. If you’re not sitting near your friends and are sharing a seat with someone who you don’t know very well, take the opportunity to get to know your fellow student a little better.


If you’re not sure what to talk about, consider having a conversation about the field trip and what you expect to see and do during the day.

, If your field trip destination is a significant distance from school, you’ll have to sit through a long bus ride. That’s why it’s a good idea to bring something to entertain yourself, so time passes a little more quickly. If you bring your phone or tablet, you may be able to listen to music or play games. You might prefer to bring a book or some magazines that you can share with friends.Make sure to ask your teacher if you’re allowed to bring your phone, tablet, or other electronic devices before the trip. You don’t want to count on your device to entertain you, only to have your teacher confiscate it when you get on the bus.

, In some cases, your teacher may give you an assignment before the trip to help prepare for the activities or exhibits that you will see at the venue. They may assign reading or ask you to do research on a related topic. Make sure that you’ve completed the assignment before you leave the trip, so you know that you’re fully prepared to take in everything that you’ll experience on the trip.If you don’t understand something that you read or research as part of your pre-trip assignment, ask your teacher for clarification. You don’t want to go on the trip feeling confused.

, To ensure that you have a good time on your field trip, it’s important to choose appropriate clothing. Your teacher may include outfit recommendations or guideline in the materials about the trip, so be sure to read them carefully. In some cases, all the students may be required to wear the same color shirt, so it’s easier to keep track of everyone on the trip.Field trips often involve a great deal of walking, so be sure to wear comfortable shoes, such as tennis shoes or sneakers.
For an outdoor field trip, make sure that you’re dressed appropriately for the weather. That means wearing a raincoat and boots in rain, and a warm jacket or coat for cold weather. In the heat, shorts and a t-shirt can help you cool.
If the venue is indoors, you don’t have to worry about the weather. However, you may want to bring a light sweater in case the air conditioning is very strong.
Some field trips may require more formal attire. For example, if you’re attending a play or concert, jeans and sneakers may not be appropriate. Ask your teacher if you’re not sure what to wear.

, Depending on where you are going, you may need to bring certain accessories on the trip. The information that your teacher provides should contain a list of necessary items, so read carefully. In general, you may want to have a notebook or pad and pen to take notes.Make sure that you take any medical supplies that you might need, such as medication, an inhaler, or an EpiPen, in case of an emergency.
You may want to have a little money on you in case the trip venue has a gift shop or you want to buy a drink or snack.
If you’re going to be outdoors all day, don’t forget to pack sunscreen so you can reapply as necessary.

, Most field trips keep you away from school all day, so you’ll probably eat lunch at the venue. Some locations may have a cafeteria or snack bar where you can purchase food, while others do not. Your teacher will inform you of the food situation, so you can decide whether to pack a lunch or bring money to buy a meal.If you are packing a lunch for warm weather, you may want to include cold packs to ensure that your food doesn’t spoil.
You may want to pack an extra bottle of water, juice, or your favorite beverage to ensure that you stay hydrated throughout the trip.

, The most important thing that you can do to ensure that you enjoy a field trip is to obey the rules. You don’t want to be yelled at or pulled out of the field trip for behaving badly because you may miss out on fun, interesting activities. Your teacher will likely go over the rules before you leave for the trip, but make sure to listen to the guidelines that staff at your destination, such as a museum tour guide, share as well.


Remember that you’re representing your entire school when you’re on a field trip, so it’s important to behave and establish a good reputation for the school.
If you and other students break rules and are generally unruly, not only may your school not be invited back to the venue, but your class may not be able to go on any field trips in the future.
Don’t be afraid to ask questions if you’re unsure of the rules. You don’t want to accidentally break a rule because you don’t understand what is and is not permitted.

, Before you arrive at the field trip destination, your teacher has probably given you a background lesson on the subject matter. The venue usually helps bring the lesson to life in a fun, interesting way that it couldn’t in a classroom, though, so it’s important to pay attention to the activities and presentations that occur during the field trip so you really absorb the information.


It’s always exciting to be out of school, but you shouldn’t just use the opportunity to chat with your friends. You’re still supposed to learn something even though you’re out of the classroom.
If you have friends who have a habit of distracting you, it’s a good idea to tell them that you really want to pay attention on the trip. You might say, “I really like talking/hanging out with you, but let’s save that for lunch. I really want to pay attention today.”

, When you hear where you’re going on your field trip, you might write the experience off as boring because it’s tied to a lesson that you’ve learned in school. However, you should go into the trip with an open mind because getting to experience the lesson out in the field is often much more interesting than simply reading a book or listening to a lecture. Be receptive to whatever you may experience on the field trip, so you really get the most out of it.For example, if you’ve read a Shakespearean play in class and are going to see a production of it, you might assume you’ll be bored because you didn’t enjoy reading it. However, a life performance can often bring the story and characters to life in a powerful way, so you may actually enjoy the play.
If your field trip is to a venue that you’ve been to before, such as a zoo, and you feel like the exhibits are all things that you’ve seen before, try to consider the location from a new perspective. Don’t just study the animals at the zoo; think about what it would like to be a zoologist or veterinarian to help you see the venue in a new way.

, Your teacher may give you worksheets that they want you to complete after the trip. You don’t necessarily have to fill them out while you’re actually on the field trip, but it’s a good idea to at least read them over at the start. That will help you know what things you should keep an eye out for during the trip, and help ensure that you get the most out of the experience.If your teacher hasn’t provided worksheets, there may still be some type of follow-up assignment after the trip, such as an essay. You may want to bring a small notebook or pad with you so you can jot down some notes as you go.

, When you're on a field trip to a place that you've never been before, it can be easy to get lost. If you pair up with a friend, you two can look out for each other. You'll notice if your buddy wanders off, and they'll notice if you do. That way, you can get help for one another if it's necessary. Knowing you're responsible for someone else can also help you become more aware of your surroundings. If you don't have a good friend on the trip, look for someone else who's in a similar situation and pair up with them.

",How to Deal with Signing Up for a Boring School Field Trip," It might be a little disappointing for your friends who are all going, but if you seriously detest the idea, just ask if you can take it back!


If you cannot take it back, just pretend you're sick on the day of the trip. Say all the hype made you unwell and you can't attend. Just make sure you weren't acting moody when you found out what the trip was really for, or you parents will catch on quickly and send you on the trip.
Be very tenacious if you're not allowed to cut the trip. Go there day after day and spend ages begging firmly to get your name scratched off the list. Make gentle threats and look angry. Don't give up if it doesn't work out after 2 days.
If all else fails, look on to step 2.;
, If it's not the worst thing you've ever seen or it is absolutely impossible to avoid going on the trip, just go on the trip. It will be over before you know it, and at least you'll learn not to sign up for random things in the future!


Don't think about it too much. Chances are, you're not going to die if you go on a trip to a history museum if you dislike history. You shouldn't let this trip occupy your whole sanity even when it's over.
If it's making you angry, look at how to calm down when angry for details. Don't forget, it's completely normal to be angry in a scenario such as this, but don't let it get you down too long.
Distract yourself, if you can't stop yourself from thinking about it. Go window shopping, or watch some of your all-time favourite YouTube videos again and again. You will know if it's working or not because there should be a smile on your face and you should not be thinking of the trip at all.
Just accept the fact that you have to go, and there's no escape. Don't plot anything stupid in your head or you may end up re-enacting it in real life.

, Whether it's an overnight trip or a day trip, you have to pack or risk the morning rush when the last thing you need is to be searching for your packed lunch.


It's better if you pack in advance, whether it's a week before or a day before. By doing it in advance, you'll be able to replicate the smooth actions of people in adverts - all you have to do is pick up your bags and leave to your pick-up point.
Make sure you check what you should bring and what you shouldn't bring. If you were given a letter explaining a brief list of things you should bring, follow that. If not, just think of where you are going and what the weather is like. Don't forget to pack clothing that is appropriate for all weather in case you get caught wearing a sunhat in the rain.
Have a good attitude. Sure, you feel absolutely mortified that you have to go to the most boring place on Earth, but it's not going to ruin your life. Don't think that, if you put on a moody attitude, everyone will take you somewhere exciting just for you. If you have to go, you'll have to lose the attitude.

, Since it will probably take a while, especially if you are going by coach, it's better if you buddy up with someone that won't be shooting you dark looks every five seconds.


If you've already been put in a pair by the teacher, and you're with someone you don't necessarily like, be polite to them at first. When they start annoying you, to the point where they are unbearably annoying, just ask the teacher, ""Could I move, please?"" The teacher will have to let you move then.
Don't get disappointed straight away if you can't be with your friends. At least once in your lifetime you will be separated from them temporarily. Once again, you won't die if you don't sit with your friends.
Be sensible if you are seated with friends. Don't start going crazy, spread gossip loudly or just act like the coach belongs to you. Not only will you get a lot of remarks, you'll probably be split from your friends and sent to sit somewhere else. Now is not the time to go crazy.

, If you're allowed to go off on your own (with an adult) then listen to them too. Don't be that one kid in class that's always screwing everything up.


Do not complain! Everybody hates people who complain about everything. If you must, write your feelings down in a totally private journal or keep them stored in your head, but whatever you do, don't go round badmouthing the place you're at!
Always follow your group. However fascinating one thing is, you must stick with your group at all times. If you're by yourself, make sure you know exactly where you're going and where you must return. You'll get to see everything eventually, and if at the end of the trip you still haven't, then is the time to speak up.
Take notes of what you should and shouldn't do, if you are very forgetful. It will save you from big trouble.

, Don't go round begging for money from other people, and don't ever, ever steal. By doing this, you will ensure that your experience in the gift shop is as perfect as everyone else's.


As stated above, don't rely on other people to pay for your items. Unless you're absolutely sure you can pay them back, don't say, ""I'll pay you back!"" If you promise someone that you will pay them back and never return the money you took, people will think you are not trustworthy.
Keep a calculator with you if you're not very good at maths so you can quickly work out the total of things and how much money you'll have left.
Don't test items before you've bought them, unless it states that you have a permission to do so, especially not things like food and jewellery. There's a very decent amount of germs on your body, so don't open packets, or put on lipgloss. There will usually be a tester for you to try out.

There are many ways to mentally prepare yourself for school.",How to Be Mentally Prepared and Organized Before School Starts," Begin doing this about 2 weeks before school starts. This way, you will be well adjusted to waking up early and you will be alert and ready for school. So, if you have to wake up at 6:30 set your alarm to 6:20.;
, It is much easier to be relaxed at school if you aren't hiding your way-too-baggy pants or way-too-short skirt from the administration. The in-things or autumn fashions might be different as well so just wear some comfy clean clothing until the ""must-haves"" come in, then you can adapt if you want to. Don't wear anything flashy or summery for about a week beforehand, as you definitely won't be wearing that in school! Also remember that if you have been dressing like a slob in the summer then about a week beforehand, make an effort with your appearance- it will prepare you for the clothing attention.

, This is a very important thing to do. Eating fuels up your brain with energy to get going. Scientists proved that kids who eat breakfast every morning get better grades than kids who don't. Try to avoid the sugary cereal breakfast though, the sugar rush will peter out by mid morning, leaving you craving more sugar. A healthy breakfast will maintain your energy through lunch time and it will make you feel ready for class. However, don't eat too much. It is difficult to remain calm and relaxed on the first day of school if you are being seen heading to the bathroom every five minutes.

, You will feel much more comfortable entering a class when you already have an idea of the material you will cover. Take extra care of your textbooks. Most schools have fee of around $50 if you damage or lose a book.If you lose your book, the teacher will identify you as a bad student, which is a complete no-no for a good student.

, This way you will already have your materials organized when you go to class. It will be easy to get the one or two extra materials your teacher may request of you. An idea of things to get:


#2 Pencils
Paper
Folders & Binders
Highlighters
Pens
Mini Stapler
Paper Clips
A Printer if you A) Don't have one B) Know you will be typing a lot of papers C) Don't want to pay the library fee.
Notebooks
Backpack
Erasers

, It's important to have this task down because it can help you stay very organized. Only put the most essential things you will need in your backpack, leave the rest that you think you will need in the locker. After all, lockers aren't only for decorating, they are actually for schoolwork. Make sure you keep the heaviest things closest to your back, the bag will seem lighter if you do this. Clean your bag every week, or every day if you prefer.Put items only for school in your backpack, phones and electronic gizmos are more likely to be confiscated. If your school allows and so do your parents to take them to school, leave them in lockers during classes or shut them off.

, They will help immensely when you start classes, and you will be able to balance classes, studying, sports, and social time much better. You will be less stressed when you can actually see that you have time set aside for the things you need to do. Put your Homework in so as not to forget it- most people find that doing it right after school is really good (it's great to know that it's done!) If your school provides you with a planner, that is the one you should use Mark the tasks done with a green sketch pen or any other color, and the ones not yet done with a red mark or with any other mark, but make sure it is not the same as the done work mark, or your confusion will touch a great height. Be sure to reward yourself after all of the tasks are marked with green, you have accomplished something today!

, People cannot tell you exactly how you yourself can get ready in the most effective way. But they will have ideas. Mix up different ideas and form new ones of your to find method that works best. Don't worry about organization, look for different articles to organize yourself on wikihow. Don't worry if you and your crew won't stay together, meet after school or every weekend and talk in study hall and in between classes to survive the separation nation. You should not worry about getting bullied. Chances are that the teachers will be watching what goes on in the halls. But if teachers sit somewhere else or are busy in study hall, complain to any teacher afterwards.

Relax about how you look: If you smile and simply ignore comments from people who tease you, you will be more confident.
But if there is something you want to change about yourself, do it.

Make new friends.,
Have correct posture.,
Learn well.,
Maintain your appearance.,
Use accessories.,
Be prepared for school photographs.,
Stay healthy.,
Beware of drugs and drinking.",How to Be Confident During Your First Few Weeks at High School," If you are very shy, hang out with your friends from primary/middle school, and become friends with the friends they make. If you don't know anyone, talk to the people in your classes. A great way to make friends is to join some activities. That is a great way to meet new people that have similar interests and backgrounds as you.;
, Stand/sit up straight in lessons, and walk with purpose. Hallways can get crowded, but keep your head up and you'll be fine. Don't just walk with your head down listening to music.

, Keep your grades up, and don't be afraid to ask/answer questions in class. This is the most important part of the whole article. You are in school for your education, not primarily to socialize. By no means does this mean you can't make friends and have a good time, but you'll regret skipping classes to hang out with friends if you fail. Also, don't worry that people will see you as ""uncool"" if you do well in class- most people will respect it, and those who don't aren't worth impressing. You will fit in some group in you are a normally sociable person.

, If you want, get a new haircut. Use anti-bacterial face wash every morning to keep spots at bay. Brush your teeth, maybe use mouthwash too. If you have a uniform, make sure you always looks smart in it. Sloppiness makes you look like you're not bothered with anything, and may even get you a detention. If you feel more comfortable with make up (and your school allows it), wear it, but remember, less really is more. No one looks pretty with layers upon layers of caked on make up. It's about highlighting your good features, not covering them all up!

, Buy yourself a cool bag or backpack, and customize it (with buttons, badges,etc) if you want. If your school allows accessories, go for it, but remember to keep it tasteful and minimal.

, This step is for a little later on, but when school photo day comes, get a good night's sleep the night before, make sure you look good in the morning. If you don't have uniform, don't dress in the latest fashion, as it will date, and you will cringe years later! Go for the things that never go out of fashion. Don't do your hair and make up elaborately, keep it nice, clean, and simple. Come to school as you normally will be and relax when it is getting taken. If you prefer to smile, try to think of something amusing or funny to get that nice natural smile, especially if you have an overbite.

, This, like education, is very important. Eat healthily and drink lots of water. It's tempting to eat cafeteria fries all the time, but go for a salad or sandwich every once in a while. Or better yet, pack your own healthy lunch.

, Depending on your circle of friends, your family, your environment, and your personal beliefs, you may choose to drink or try drugs. If you do choose to do these things, keep it to a minimum, and never before, or during school. Both drinking and drugs are addictive, and partying excessively can become out of control very quickly. Be smart if you decide to drink or do drugs, and never drive under the influence. Also, it's important to note that most private schools will expel you if you are caught drinking or on drugs (or in possession of anything illegal), even if it's outside of school. Don't let one wild night ruin your high school career.

DON'T dress to impress.,
Be clean.,
Be confident.,
If you have a friend that you know at the school, don't ignore her or anything, but don't cling to her, as it can 1. irritate your friend and 2. make you seem very shy.,
If you think you have a crush on a guy, don't do anything about it.,
Although a bit odd, you need to discreetly find out about 5 types of people: 1. blabber-mouths/gossipers, 2. nice girls who could potentially be a friend, 3. girls who are not so nice to you, so you know to try to steer clear of them when needed, 4. nice guys who could be potential friends, and 5. guys who are not so nice so that you can stay out of their way.

,
Talk to people.,
Be nice to everyone, don't become known as the new mean girl.,
Do not criticize or talk about people behind their back.",How to Be Confident on Your First Day of a New School (for Preteens)," Now, this isn't a written invitation to go to school in your pajamas and leave your hair unbrushed/combed, but don't feel as if you should change your look to impress fellow classmates. Wear what you are comfortable in and styles that you personally like, as long as it adheres to your school's clothes policies and is neat.;
, Again, this doesn't mean smear your face with pounds of makeup. It just means that you shouldn't look dirty. Wash your face, brush or comb your hair, have neat hands and nails, and clean teeth. Makeup is not restricted for the preteen age, but I would personally suggest that if you want to wear makeup, go for a natural look, with colors close to your skin tone. Make SURE not to wear a lot of eye makeup, it just looks like you're trying too hard to be pretty. A clear gloss, concealer if you have acne, and maybe some mascara on your upper lash line is sufficient.

, If you are naturally shy, work on your smile, and things you can say to people. If you are allowed to talk to people before school starts, instead of being the one who people whisper about, saying things such as, ""Look at that new girl over there all by herself,"" suck up your nerves and walk over to a girl who looks friendly (trust me you will want to start off with a girl) and say, ""Hi, my name is _________. I like your _______"" (shirt, bracelet, etc.) If she really is a nice girl, then she will probably begin to talk to you, or (hopefully) introduce you to some other people in your class. If she is not so nice, don't lose hope, just try it again with another girl.

, Try to talk to a variety of girls, and, if you begin to feel comfortable with it, talk to some guys as well.

, You really need to find out more about his personality. And also, if you do slip something about liking him, it could end up getting to him, and if he doesn't like you, you don't want to get humiliated on the first day!

,, If there is a tense/awkward moment, don't let it drag on. Say something funny and witty to break the ice.

, Defend yourself if need be, but do it in the quietest and nicest way possible. The more friends you have, the more support and trust you will gain.

, Whatever you do will have consequences, whether they are good or bad.

Give it time.",How to Make Friends at a New School," Try not to be nervous. Remember that you’re not the only one looking for new friends. Depending on when you arrive at your new school, some cliques may have already formed, but there’ll be others just like you who are looking for new friends. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself.You might have fewer friends at your new school than you did at your old school, and that’s ok. As life goes on, there are peaks and valleys in social popularity and it isn’t your fault.;
, Never change who you are to try to fit in. If your friends don't accept you for you, they're not really friends. Most people belong with a certain clique simply because they are being themselves and their unique personalities and interests falls into that stereotype.


For example, someone who is naturally athletic may become a jock in high school while someone who is naturally artistic will fit in with other artistic students.

, Clothes are a big part of image and self-confidence. Instead of trying to wear an outfit you think will impress people, focus on wearing clothes you like. They’ll give people an idea of your personality, but more importantly you’ll feel comfortable in your own skin.If your school has a uniform, try and see if there are ways to make it fit your style. Many schools will give you a choice of outfits, or you can try and wear a pin that reflects your style.

, As you work to become more confident, it’s important to change your mindset. Instead of worrying about not finding friends, picture yourself succeeding and meeting new people. Recognize all the small successes along the way, such as talking to someone new and enjoying the conversation., You’ll have easier an time making friends if you see yourself as a worthy friend. Write down some positive things about yourself, and keep the list somewhere handy so you can refer to it anytime you’re feeling less confident.


A fun trick you can use for this is to think of your favorite celebrities. Write down qualities that both you and them possess; it’ll help you carry yourself more confidently., This goes a long way to making you seem more approachable. When you walk in the halls, don't hunch over your books or keep your eyes on the floor. Hold your head up and make eye contact with other people. If you see someone you know, give them a smile and say hi., Obviously you’ll want to introduce yourself and tell people a little bit about yourself. However, if you ask questions about people, they’ll feel like you’re more interested in them, which is a sign of a good friend.


You can also ask questions to start a conversation, like ""How's the cafeteria food around here?"" or ""How long have you gone to this school?""
Use questions to compliment people as you start the conversation: ""I love your shoes, where did you get them?"", Save someone a seat. Say ""hi"" in the hall. Give congratulations for a job well done. Pay a compliment: ""I love your shoes/backpack."" It can work wonders.

, Even if you try your best to be kind and approachable, not everyone will want to be your friend. They’ll have their own reasons; it can be as simple as not having common interests. If you get the feeling someone doesn’t want to be your friend, or they tell you outright, don’t try to pursue them. You can’t force them to be your friend., Anywhere, such as near your locker or at the water fountain, you can find someone that has things in common with you, all you need is to know how to approach them. Strike up a conversation, smile and compliment them, and, of course, introduce yourself and tell them where you came from! You never know where you can find a nice friend.


Since you’re new, people are likely going to be curious about you and will be more open to talking with you. Take advantage of this., It doesn’t matter whether it’s a club, the theatre group or a sports team. It’ll give you the chance to meet new people that you’ll see regularly, two things that encourage the formation of new friendships. On top of that, joining extra-curricular activities means you’ll find others who enjoy the things you do more easily.


You can also use this opportunity to try new things you might not have wanted to do at your old school. A new school is a chance to reinvent yourself, so don’t be afraid to try new things!, You're probably not the only one and at the very least, you'll have one thing in common: you're both in an unfamiliar environment. Since being new is something that you all have in common, making new friends shouldn't be that hard. Talk about your old school, your new school, your opinions, grades, teachers, and you’re bound to find something in common.

, You’ll be noticed more there than at the front or the back of the class. You’ll have an easier time making conversation with people, and are more likely to be paired up with a variety of people for group projects.

, You might not necessarily make friends on your first day at your new school, and that’s ok. Building friendships takes time, and you need to find the right people as well. As long as you don’t give up, you’ll eventually find people you can call your friends."

Shape up.,
Get rid of acne.,
Style.,
Hygiene.,
Personality.",How to Achieve a Perfect Version of You for the Next School Year," Nothing's better then going to school a healthy weight and toned. If you are overweight, don't make it your goal to be thin, just a healthy weight! Even if you are already a healthy weight, you should take some time out during the summer to exercise. It'll make you look and feel better!;
, If you have bad acne (or acne at all) that just won't go away and is bothering you, get rid of it. How? Well, if your acne is seriously bad it is important to go to your doctor. Because he/she will recommend a product that ACTUALLY works. In other cases where your acne isn't so bad, try using a face wash or acne regimen. Toothpaste can also work well as a last-minute acne spot treatment.

, Do you usually go to school wearing sweatpants and a t-shirt? Come back to school looking hot! People don't recognize you because you always look the same. Well, try to find clothes that suit you well. Search sale racks, used clothing places, and vintage shops for great clothes at cheap prices. You will look great and no one will know how little you paid!

, Even if you have good hygiene you can always improve it. Don't come to school with an ashy body (as if you didn't put any skin cream, body butter, or oils on). Have your hair done nicely, wear clean clothes, brush your teeth, take showers. Use deodorant and/or perfume; for example, if you like how a boy smells with Axe or cologne, they'll probably like the way you smell with perfume or deodorant.

, Finally here's the last step! Don't turn into a completely different person. Instead of becoming someone else try to peel away layers of your personality to reveal something of yourself which is really pure and true. People have a knack for being drawn towards those who are really original. What you should do is:


if you're really shy, try to come out of your shell or if you're always serious or boring, be playful and fun. If you're just in the background do something that makes you stand out (for good!)

Write down all of your goals.,
Create precise goals for yourself.,
Think of immediate and long-term goals.,
Make deadlines for your goals.,
Start with a positive attitude.,
Get organized.,
Don’t procrastinate.,
Attend every class.,
Ask questions when you need help.,
Use a planner.,
Reward yourself for your progress.,
Overcome mistakes.,
Create new goals halfway through the year.,
Reflect on your progress.,
Get enough sleep.,
Find ways to relax.",How to Achieve Your Goals for the New School Year," You don’t have to think of realistic or precise goals just yet. Begin by writing down any goal that comes to mind. For example, write down “make captain of the football team.” Even if you aren’t sure it’s a realistic goal, it’s okay to write it down at this point. You can narrow down your goals later.Write your goals on a poster and stick it above the desk that you look at each day.;
, You may be excited and making all kinds of goals, but it’s better to pace yourself once you’ve written your initial goals down. Choose specific, realistic goals or even one single but very important goal. When it comes to choosing your goal, ensure that it states precisely what it is that you want to achieve. Write these down in a journal and keep it with you at home and school.For example, instead of saying you want to study more, say that you want to study for three hours every night during the school week.

, Now that you’ve written down specific goals, separate them into either immediate or long-term goals. An immediate goal would be to organize all of your notes and schoolwork. A long-term goal would be to make honor roll at then end of the year. Keep the immediate and long-term goals on separate pages., There are certain things you won’t be able to set deadlines for, like final tests and tryouts for teams. But, you do need to make deadlines for goals that don’t have set dates. For example, if you want to learn a certain amount of vocabulary words for the SAT, set a number for a specific date. Write down that date in your notebook and keep it in mind as the year progresses.It’s also helpful to write down the dates of things that are out of your control, like final tests.

, Seeing all of your goals written down can be overwhelming. A positive attitude is essential when it comes to achieving your goals. You can maintain a positive attitude by thinking of the positive things that happen in your day, considering your strengths, and remembering that everyone has a bad day sometimes.Write down your thoughts and feelings in a journal in a positive way. For example, instead of writing “Stop failing vocabulary quizzes,” you can write “Improve grades on vocabulary quizzes.”
Be open with a friend or family member about your feelings and worries.

, Getting organized will make it easier to stay on top of achieving your goals. Organize your backpack, locker, notebooks, and anything else that holds your schoolwork or other paperwork. Determine what you need and get rid of the junk. Keep your things organized throughout the school year.Spend 10 minutes on organization when you get home from school every day.

, It’s easy to get distracted and do something that sounds like more fun than work. A little bit of procrastination is normal, so don’t get mad at yourself if it happens. Instead, work on overcoming procrastination. Do things like prioritizing your tasks, starting with the hardest task, and breaking your tasks down into 15 minute chunks.Set small periods of time each week for TV and internet use that isn't for research purposes. Don't allow these times to bleed into study time or to replace it.

, Skipping classes will only prevent you from achieving your goals. Try to never skip class unless it is for a good reason, like sickness. Take every class seriously and take notes. If you do miss class, ask your teacher and schoolmates what you missed., It’s normal to struggle with something at some point in school. Even if you’re not struggling, be curious and ask questions. This will help you learn more and be prepared to take on your goals. Ask for extra help from a tutor or parent if you find that you aren’t understanding something on your own.Ask the question to your teacher after class if you’re not comfortable raising your hand in class.

, Keep a personal planner with you at all times. Buy a planner that includes the dates you will be in school and has enough room to write things down. First, write down all of the permanent due dates. Then, write down your daily assignments and weekly goals. Keep up the planner for the rest of the year.You can also keep a calendar on your wall.

, Occasionally, when you've achieved certain milestones in your goal plan, take a break and reward yourself. See a favorite movie, visit a friend who lives across town, go to the ice cream parlor with your friends, or buy yourself something new. If you don't have the money to purchase rewards for yourself, find ways to reward yourself that don't cost anything.


This can include setting aside a favorite game or activity only for when you earn it.

, You are going to make mistakes during the process of achieving your goals. That is completely normal and expected. Even if it’s not you making a mistake, you’re going to encounter some kind of obstacle. Don’t let these problems overwhelm you. Gather your thoughts, readjust your efforts, and maintain a positive mindset.Break down your goals into smaller chunks if you find that your initial list was not possible.

, Once you’ve gone through the first part of the school year, make a list for the second half. You may have some goals that you haven’t accomplished yet, and that’s okay. Put those goals at the top of your new list. Write down a few other realistic and manageable goals., At some point during the year, you will need to evaluate your progress. Think of what you’ve accomplished so far. You should also consider what you need to work on. Once you’ve done that, you can figure out what you need to do to get better as the year goes on.You can review your progress halfway through the year, or do it once a month.

, Sleep is very important, especially when you’re keeping up with a busy school schedule. Don’t overwhelm yourself so much that you lose out on sleep. Try to maintain a sleeping schedule. Go to bed at the same time every night and get at least eight hours of sleep.Avoid caffeine and other stimulants, like television screens, before you go to bed.

, Hard work is necessary but so is relaxation. Overwhelming yourself can lead to exhaustion and mood problems, which could prevent you from achieving your goals. Do things like sports, meditation, or writing to help you relax.Exercising can also help you sleep better.

Find out everything you need for each class.,
Only bring the books that you need for that class.,
Use smaller binders.,
Carry less supplies.,
Try to fit things in your binder.,
Use your locker!,
Learn how to become organized.",How to Carry Fewer Books for Class," Bring only what you need for that day. Ask your teacher at the beginning of the day for that day, or at the end of the school day for the next day. It might be a good idea to bring a piece of paper, your student planner, or your assignment notebook along with you so that you can jot down the books to bring. By doing this, you are limiting the amount of books that were required for you to bring.;
, Keep books that are for homework or other classes in your locker unless you have to attend that class immediately after the class before, and you are not allowed to go to your lockers in between classes. Just bring what you will need for that class period. Always bring a book for you to read in case you complete the assignment, this way you will not just be sitting there, many teachers assign punishments for that, so always bring some kind of reading material in your classes. This may require more room, but it can be a life-saver.

, Or, you could use one extra large binder and get subject dividers to separate each class. You could also have two normal sized binders, one in the morning and one for the afternoon. Keep the morning one in your bookbag for all of your morning classes, and keep your afternoon in your locker until the end of the day, when you might need it most.

, Don't carry a stapler and 50 pencils. Have a small, sturdy, fabric pencil case that holds all of your supplies. Supplies include; pencils, pens, small tape roll, small stapler, staples, highlighters, crayons, markers, etc., these things can easily fit into a small pencil case. Carry all of your supplies (pencil case with smaller supplies, notebooks, binder, folders, textbooks, workbooks) in your book bag. This will make sure you do not have to hold ANY supplies what-so-ever, and give you more arm-space.

, Things like folders, spiral notebooks, etc can help you when in your binder. This can lighten the load for you, because it will easily fit into your book bag, and you can purchase a pencil case that clips right into your binder, so then all you would need to remember is your packed up binder for each class!

, Store books in your locker in the order of which you will need them, such as, if this was your schedule: Math, Science, P.E, Lunch, Social Studies, English; your English books would be on the bottom of the pile, and your math books would be on the top. This will help you get the books easier each day. Make a locker schedule, the same way you would make a homework schedule. You should only really need to access your locker 4 times each day; once in the very beginning of the day (for your morning classes), once right before lunch (for your lunch bag/box and to drop off the morning books), once right after lunch (to drop of your lunch bag/box and to get your afternoon books), and once right before you leave (to get your homework books, pick up your things to get home, and to drop off the afternoon's books that you don't need for that evening's work).

, This may seem silly, but many students have trouble in school just because they are not organized. It may help if you read other wikihow articles on the subject. Many teachers appreciate organized students, and to become organized is very simple. Clean out your desk, locker, book bag, and binder. Make sure all trash is thrown away, and all old papers are put in your folder to bring home. Here are a few wikihow articles that may help you become organized:

Even if that certain item wasn't on the supplies list, you should get it if you really feel you need it. As they say, ""It's better to have something and not need it than to need something and not have it"". Good things you might need:


Number 2/HB pencils or mechanical pencils
Tabs to mark pages
Folders and binders
Erasers
Paperclips
Mini stapler/stapler refills/staple remover
Planner
Notebooks/composition books
Loose-leaf paper
White-out
Red/black/blue pens
Scissors (small)
Highlighter
Calculator (if needed)
Glue Stick
USB;
, A pencil case is a key part of being a well-organized student. It will keep all your supplies organized and in one place. Get a pencil case with lots of pockets for better organizing.


Get a quality pencil case that will last you through the school year.
Fill your pencil case with the supplies you will need for class. These include pencils, calculators, and erasers. Remember that your pencil case only needs to contain what you need for every class. Anything needed for a specific class can be kept in a binder pencil case or folder.

, Remember to keep heavier things closer to your back and the lighter things further away. If you already have an organized backpack, skip to the next step.

, If you have a locker, it may get messy. See if the school will allow you to bring in a shelf. That way, you can put books, extra papers or supplies on one and keep them away from your other things. But before you install that shelf, rip up all the papers you don't need so they won't be copied. (Remember to clean out your locker every week or two. This will ensure that your locker will stay neat and organized.) If your school lets you come in early, take that time to clean out your locker. Bring a plastic bag if you know that your locker is messy.

, If you use a laptop for your schoolwork, print your work out on the next opportunity you have. This can stop you from getting into trouble with your teachers or wasting a lot of time printing a bulk of papers during the weekend. Be sure you have everything on your laptop backed up in case something goes wrong.Remember that all your notes and handouts on your laptop should be just as organised as they are in your binder or notebooks, folders and drives will help you achieve this.


Create a folder for each class (and make sure they are colour coded) e.g. pink for English, blue for Maths, green for HSIE etc.
Create subfolders inside each folder (homework, presentations, online textbooks etc.)
Do the same thing on all online drives, use the same colours
Remember to regularly clean through your files but never delete something if you think you may need it again.

, Planners are most helpful. Most schools sell them, but some don't. Buy one or make your own if the school doesn't provide one. Write down your homework, tests, or club meeting dates. Write down things that you know you'll forget. Make sure to look in it before you go home so that you take home everything that you need. Keeping your planner organised is absolutely essential, remember to read the tips below:


Make sure it is something you want to write in and read regularly.
Have a bullet and colour code this can be a square for a task and a circle for an appointment but remember to personalise it to you.
When your teacher tells you something, write it into your planner immediately.
Personalise your binder to your taste. Some people like planners as binders, or bound objects it is really your choice.

, You should get one binder for each different class you have. Make sure that you get different colors for each subject and label them. Getting just one binder for everything is not a good idea. The binder will become messy and crowded. And you might get papers mixed up.


Use tabs to label different sections in your binder (ex. Graded, Homework,Handouts, etc.).

, Having all of those extra papers that you got back a month ago in your folder will make it heavy. It may bend and tear. Plastic folders are a better choice if you constantly have torn folders.

, This may seem obvious, but put any papers you need to keep in its subject folder. Don't let loose papers mingle about. Take those extra seconds and put them in a folder. That way, you'll have them when you need them. Teachers become annoyed when they are constantly receiving crumpled papers.


If it is easier for you find folders that will go in your binder and do the same with notebooks. It can give a lot of peace of mind knowing everything is together.

, Another way to get organized is to use an accordion folder. Accordion folders are the folders that expand and have many places for different kinds of paper. Having all your papers in one is better than having a whole bunch of folders.

, This organizes everything and prevents you from losing anything.

, When you get to class, don't goof off with friends. Pay attention and write down your homework in your planner and begin any assignments. Never draw a teacher's attention to you with goofy behavior.

, This is a big one. Especially in high school. When you start taking notes, put the date at the top of the paper, so when you have a big test you can look back to study and everything will be in order. Doing this in history class is a major thing. Also, if a friend needs notes from a certain time you'll have it.

, Use a highlighter for the important parts. Write the date, title and homeroom number, in case you lose it.

, When you know something is due, get your supplies as soon as possible. When you get your supplies, plan out everything that you want to be included in the project. Work on it little by little each day. Do not wait until the last minute to begin your project. The night before the project is due, look over it. See if you have missed any important steps. Put what is due in a small pile next to your backpack. If it is an essay, put it in your folder. If it is raining or snowing, put your project in your backpack or cover it with a garbage bag.

, If you start worrying about other people or let people copy your homework, just tell them no. Say you need to stay organized and you need to keep your grades up and you can't cost them losing your homework paper.

, Do your work as soon as it is assigned so that you do not end up doing stuff at the last minute. Also, do not depend on friends to help you with homework. It is perfect if you and a friend are working together, but do not be the only one working.This should cover the free time you have after school and on weekends, etc. This can keep you in the routine of setting out your homework and weekend times and will help you to feel much more organized and prepared.


Remember to treat this how you would your normal planner
Look at it in the morning and when you are doing your homework

, Have a desk with paper, pencils, pens and other school supplies in your room or in a quiet area. This is for your homework and projects. All supplies should be kept there. Creating a homework station is very easy and useful. A lot of people put everything they will need on a basket and place it on the table to avoid interruptions when you need a new supply.

, You don't want to be doing homework and notice you forgot a binder or notebook.

, This will let your mind understand that this is a place for work and not a place to play.

, After you get done with your homework clean out your backpack and put everything that you might need for the next day back in. Take out the things you don't. (If you're not sure go ahead and put it in anyway). Put your backpack someplace you won't forget it. This way your already ready for school the next day and don't have to worry if you have everything.

, Every night take all your school stuff home including binders, folders, notebooks, etc., and label it according to period, subject, and time that class starts. It is also recommended to put your current grade on the inside of the appropriate notebook/folder for that subject. It will help you stay focused on getting it higher.

, Do it that same night before your favorite program comes on TV or you go out. If you don't, you'll risk doing it on the bus, or not doing it all (or at all) and then get in trouble with the teacher.

, If you're absent, do the make-up work right away. If you don't then you will get behind and maybe even miss out a whole section which might come up in some exams.

, If you need to clean out your desk, make sure that you clean it out before school so that you can find anything you need in your desk. If you don't have a desk, then don't worry about this one.

, You probably don't need to fully clean them out, but be sure to check every once in a while. Lockers can be very important though.

, If you can fit it in your locker then utilise that space and take time to grab your books between classes, in the long run you and your back will be happy you did."

Make school supply shopping fun!",How to Choose School Supplies for Middle School," See what you have left over from last year, or check with older siblings, cousins or friends to see if you can get some of the materials from them. There is no reason to junk up the earth by buying new stuff while perfectly useful items are discarded.;
, Consult the Internet to see if your school has a school supplies list on their web page. If not, then just go to your local store, like Target, K-Mart, or Walmart. Local schools may have lists posted at these stores at the beginning of the school year.

, Make a list of the school supplies that you think you need. Usually schools give you a supply list, but if yours doesn't or you lost the list, create your own! Think about the essentials that you need when creating your list. Here are some basic essentials that most schools have on the list:


A lock (unless your school's lockers have locks preinstalled.) Master locks are the best working locks out there! Combination locks are also quite handy. Just don't tell anyone the combination!
A few binders (recommended: a two inch, three ring binder).
Dividers to organize materials and papers for each class.
Supply case to fit in your three-ring binder.
12 sharpened pencils.
A pencil sharpener.
A twelve-inch (30 centimeter) ruler.
Two to four packs of notebook paper. Keep one in your backpack and the others at home for when you run out. You can get either college ruled or wide ruled, it doesn't matter in most schools.
A notebook for each academic class you will have. Buy a backup, they don't always last all year.
Scissors.
Pens.
A soft pencil case. Don't get a plastic one because it might break.
Eraser caps to put on your pencils.
A chapter book from the library. You may need to have a book with you. Some schools prefer that you don't read manga or comic books, but you can still bring one for the bus.
1 or 2 spiral notebooks, single subject.
Colored pencils, sharpened.
Two highlighters. Any colors are good, choose non-toxic ones if you can.
A sturdy backpack.
Calculator. You won't need this on the first day, and should probably wait to find out what type your teacher recommends.
Mini stapler.
Planner to organize homework.
One flash key. Get a 1GB or a 2GB flash key. Also called a USB drive or a flash drive, they have them at Office Max and Office Depot. External hard drives may also be used.
A lanyard. You may get a student ID in some schools and you put it on the lanyard and wear it around your neck.

, It will be easier for your parents and you.

, A fancy folder with a picture of your favorite movie star might cost ten to twelve times as much as a plain basic folder. You don't expect your parents to pay for the upgrades.

, Take a group of friends with you or take a look at how to make school supply shopping fun for ideas.

Get a list from your child’s school.,
Know the difference between requests and requirements.,
Purchase writing supplies.,
Buy folders.,
Purchase a day planner.,
Buy art supplies.,
Purchase personal supplies.,
Buy a sturdy backpack or book bag.",How to Buy School Supplies1," Don’t rely on your child for a list of what they need for school. If a list isn’t available on the school’s website, ask the teachers if they can send you a list or give you some ideas. As a last resort, department stores sometimes have lists of common school supplies on their websites., Before you panic over the long supply list on the school’s website, realize that many of the items are merely requests.One good rule of thumb is to avoid items the list specifically forbids. Use your best judgment as to which items your child might actually need.

, Elementary teachers usually prefer their students to use #2 (HP) pencils with erasers. Students in middle- and high school usually use ballpoint pens. Stick to black or blue ink. Most students will also need notebooks or loose-leaf paper. Check the supply list for whether you should buy wide-ruled or college-ruled paper.


Children in elementary school usually need pencil bags or boxes to store their supplies for writing and art.
Most classrooms have pencil sharpeners, but it’s always a good idea to check the supply list in case your child’s teacher requires individual pencil sharpeners.
Middle- and high-school students might need highlighters for studying and general note-taking.

, Whether students use notebooks or loose-leaf paper, they still need folders for the documents they receive in class. Buy one folder for each class, each in a different color or pattern. That way, your child can pattern- or color-code each folder by class (red for English, green for math, rainbow stripes for science, etc.).

, Students in middle school and high school usually need day planners to keep track of their classes and after-school activities. Look for planners organized by the academic year, as opposed to the semester. This way, your child will stay organized from the first day of school in the fall to the last day of school in the spring.

, Children in elementary school usually need art supplies for a variety of activities. Buy one box of crayons, colored pencils, or washable markers. Other common materials you need to purchase are safety scissors and glue. Purchase glue sticks for younger students more likely to make a mess.

, Elementary school teachers usually request one or two boxes of facial tissues per student. Hand sanitizer also comes in handy during cold and flu season. Aim for one 8-ounce (about 237mL) bottle for the classroom and one travel-sized bottle for the backpack.


Students in middle school and high school need supplies for their lockers. Common supplies include plastic shelves, mirrors, and magnets. The school supply list should mention if a combination lock is required.

, Thanks to block scheduling, many older students take only two to four classes at a time.However, textbooks haven’t gotten any lighter. Buy a bag that can carry at least two to four hardcover textbooks, a large notebook or binder, and a pencil bag.

If your school has a list of school supplies, stick to it.,
Set a budget for school shopping.,
Check the weekly store sale advertisements.,
Browse through a variety of dollar stores, department stores, stationery stores, and large stores, for the best deals on pencils, pens, notebooks, and other items.,
Team up with other local parents.,
Speak up if costs are out of control.,
Look at reconditioned or last season's options for more expensive items such as laptops or sports gear.,
Try some less obvious places.,
Wait until school starts, if you want.",How to Save On School Supplies1," Schools in some areas put out school supply lists, and typically they offer a guide to what is important to purchase. It is often a good guide, and sticking to it avoids getting sidetracked into buying unnecessary things, and possibly not even get the right things at all.


Schools which offer school supply lists will typically mail out school supply lists, but these are also easy to misplace. If so, try to contact the school (school staff will usually be onsite the week before school starts) or look at their official website. Many schools now provide a downloadable list straight from their website.
Some schools actually prefer that students do not bring in outside school supplies. For example, your child's kindergarten teacher may not want just one child to have access to sparkly crayons.
Consider whether this is a list of requirements or just suggestions. Some schools make suggestions on school supplies, but it is not actually required. Other schools or classes really do require students to bring in certain items. If you are unsure, contact the school.
Consult retail store school supply lists with skepticism. Retail stores are there to sell you things, and sometime offer lists suggesting what students at different ages need. While not necessarily a bad guide, they are also not trying to save you money, either.
Sometimes there is a general list, and sometimes a list specific to your particular child's teacher or class. For instance, the school may suggest binders, but your child's teacher requests a set of yellow, red, and blue folders.
An art class may suggest buying a certain set of art supplies. For example, a digital photography class may suggest a type of digital camera plus a certain a type of software package for a computer at home.
Decide in advance how you will respond to requests for extra items from your children. Back-to-school shopping is a prime time for whining and begging. You could allow one extra item only, or tell your child that any items outside the required list are to be paid for out of your child's own money.
Can you shop solo? Some children are very particular about back-to-school shopping, and love the ritual. However, many others could care less. If your student is happy to let you do the decision-making, consider doing the shopping by yourself; you may be able to avoid impulse buying--bringing children along tends to increase impulse buys. You may also be able to shop quicker, or more slowly and thoughtfully, or at more stores to take advantage of sales.;
, Knowing in advance how much you can afford on supplies will keep everyone's minds focused on the limits to spending.


Try withdrawing only that amount of cash budgeting for back-to-school shopping. This often helps adults and children alike be more aware of how much is being spent--credit or debit purchases tend to be harder to keep track of. Have your children involved in this process so that they can understand the process of budgeting.
Another possibility is giving your student a ""mini budget"" for a particular item or type of item. How much will depend on the child's age and ability. For instance, giving your 1st grade student $3 to choose washable markers. This can help kids learn about how to work within a budget, make decisions, and responsibility., Have your child help you find the best prices in catalogs and online. This can be a source of responsible fun for each child to find the best coupon or deal on their needed items, as well as serve as an unstructured lesson in financial responsibility. Things to keep in mind include:


Some stores have a ""loss leader"" category. These are items are sold at a loss in order to lure you into the store, hoping you will shop further there. Of course, you are not under any obligation to buy anything else, so you can take advantage of the store in this way. If you shop for the items on special on a weekly basis, over a period of several weeks, you can accumulate many of the items on the list at a sale price. You may end up repeatedly going to the store, however.
Note that specialist stationery stores can sometimes be the most expensive place to source your supplies. If you need something specific and/or high quality, that may well be the place to go. However, for most school supplies you do not need the highest quality.
Shop around to compare prices and ask for discounts if you have seen items cheaper at another store. Many stores offer price matching; however, don't expect full-service stores to match discounter prices, and don't expect discount store employees to offer personalized service. To save money, you should expect to provide your own ""customer service.""
Look for upcoming tax-free shopping days to add to your discount. Tax free sales days or weekends can provide big discounts where offered. (This is more common in the United States and Canada.)
As well as cutting out catalog coupons, print out downloadable coupons or deals that you can only get online. The effort to search through relevant sites is well worth it, as you will find coupons that can be printed, cut out and taken along to the store for discounts.

, This sounds like a lot of work (and it can be) but this can often be done while shopping for other items throughout the summer.


Avoid paying for name-brand things when you do not need to. Generics and store brands are usually for many items, such as pens, pencils, erasers, and the like.
But skimping on certain items will cost more in the long run. For example, a cheaply made backpack will likely fall apart by winter break. Investing in a high quality brand may save a lot of money in the long run. For items such as these, make sure that what you get is good enough to use and sturdy enough to last.

, Use your group buying power to purchase school supplies in bulk at reduced cost. Split the supplies up between you. This is extremely helpful if the children are in the same class. It may also eliminate the whine, ""But all my friends get this or that (expensive) thing."" when the reality, everyone will have the same brand thing.


This is especially helpful if a parent has a membership at a store like Costco, where buying in bulk can save a lot of money.
In rural or remote areas, this may also be a wise approach. It may save money for all the parents to go in on one large order, and have it shipped to your location.

, Parents are generally expected to buy school supplies such as backpacks, sneakers, lunch boxes, and binders. But sometimes, too much may be passed off as expenses for parents to foot the bill. Sometimes, this can put parents in an awkward position, especially low-income ones. This could be a concern to bring up with with the principal, the teachers, the school board, the PTA, or perhaps other parents in your child's classroom or school.


Note that for outside activities the school does not have to provide equipment and materials. For example, your daughter may need to purchase her own lacrosse equipment. Your twins may have to rent or buy tubas to join marching band. The senior trip to the national capitol will be unlikely to be free.
Teachers may not appreciate how the well-meaning lesson or field trip affects parents financially. Other parents may also be silently suffering trying to figure out how to pay for an expensive field trip, outing, or materials for a lesson. But be polite, honest, and try to assume the best. Being confrontational and angry is likely to sour the relationship between you and the teacher.
Talk to your student's teacher about field trip costs. Teachers try very hard to make sure no child cannot go to a field trip due to a family's income.
Brainstorm ways to bring costs down. For instance, perhaps a bake sale, car wash, or other school fundraiser to defray costs for the class trip.

, If a laptop is required, this is a big expense item. You can reduce the purchase costs by purchasing a reconditioned laptop from a reliable supplier, looking at older models on special, or using a hand-me-down model from another family member who no longer needs it. Try to avoid borrowing a laptop in case it gets damaged or lost, and consider insuring it.


Make use of the tax-free sales days when purchasing laptops, desktops, flash drives, and other electronic items for school. You can save thousands.Think about trading in old equipment for new or reconditioned. This can be really useful for sports or music gear. Ask your local sports or music store if they have such a system in place, or if they know of a club or other place that can help. Or check out trading bulletins or online sites for other options.

, There are some other supply sources that you might not have considered that are worth checking out:


Try your local thrift store or charity shop. Rummage through the supplies that they do have. Backpacks are a commonly donated item in many thrift stores. Many stores will also have rulers, pencils, pens, calculators, organizers, alarm clocks, and other common household items. These stores also might have furniture such as desks and office chairs. If you let them know you are looking for school supplies, and are a regular customer they might be able to keep some back for you.
Look through online auctions. This includes sites like eBay. People sell all sort of items, from glue sticks, to gym shoes, to computers. Do not forget to check the craft section for things like scissors, glue, and bulk items being cleared out. As with all online auctions, be sure to factor in any shipping.

, The first week or so of school usually does not actually need that much equipment. By waiting, you may be able to buy these ones until the stores start to move their back-to-school stock into the clearance bins at discounted prices. Very often, the first week students do not need most of the supplies requested. If you can find out which supplies will not be needed until later in the school year, you can put off buying until then.


Many stores will start reducing stock as early as a week after school has gone back, so you might not have long to wait.
However, by waiting, you risk stores selling out of product or simply not having the style or type you want.
Also, you child might be unhappy to have to put off getting supplies. Some students really love the thrill of getting back to school items. For some kids, not having new school supplies might make him or her feel left out, marginalized, or to look like ""the poor kid"". "

Buy a calculator.,
Purchase a computer.,
Buy external storage.",How to Buy School Supplies2," High school students (or advanced middle school students) taking algebra, geometry, or calculus usually need calculators. Advanced math classes require specs beyond the basic calculator you use to balance your checkbook. The two most common kinds of calculators required by algebra and geometry students are:Scientific calculators perform the functions students study in Algebra I and Algebra II. The average scientific calculator costs between $15 and $30.
Graphing calculators are required for advanced calculus classes. Graphing calculators are more expensive, costing $100 and up.

, High school students will likely need a laptop or tablet computer for their assignments. Unless school officials specify certain brands, either a Mac or a Windows computer should be fine. Word processing software, such as Microsoft Word or Open Office Writer, is a must for papers and other homework assignments. If your child needs any specialty programs (such as Photoshop for a graphic design class), the school should note them on the supply list.


Buy your computer only from reputable sources, such as Simply Mac or Best Buy. Consider an extended warranty if it fits your budget., Even students who use their laptops and tablets at school need flash drives for printing their documents. Buy a smaller (4 GB) flash drive for storing basic word documents or spreadsheets. If you child is taking classes in graphic design or computer science, opt for a larger flash drive of about 16 to 32 GB.

Sort out what you already have.,
Stick to basics and generics.,
Take advantage of discounts.,
Buy used, electronic, or out-of-copyright textbooks.,
Buy refurbished.,
Buy a little at a time throughout the year.",How to Buy School Supplies3," Check the closets, attic, or junk drawer for supplies from past school years. Chances are you have a few pens, pencils, sheets of loose-leaf paper, or coloring supplies lying around. If you have older children heading off to college, ask them if they wouldn’t mind giving their locker accessories to their younger sibling(s).


Try to find substitutes for more expensive items. For example, if your kindergartener needs an art smock, substitute an old, oversized button-down shirt.
Swap meets are another great way of accessing gently used supplies, such as binders, backpacks, locker organizers, and flash drives.

, Choose folders, notebooks, or binders in basic colors or designs. That folder or notebook featuring Batman or Yoda might be cool this year, but it will also cost more than a folder with solid colors or abstract non-commercial designs. Don’t worry about brand names, even if the school list mentions them. Generic labels are just as good for a fraction of brand-name costs., Check newspapers, store circulars, and websites for coupons. Look for items that offer rebates, and mail the rebate form as soon as possible. If you belong to a rewards site like MyPoints, shop through the website to earn points or cash back.


Cash in your points at rewards sites for gift cards or prepaid debit cards. These are usually available in denominations of $25 to $100. Use them when buying school supplies.

, Check bargain websites like Alibris or Half.com for steeply discounted used textbooks. E-book versions of required textbooks could also save you money, since printing costs are not a factor. Required reading for humanities or social sciences classes might be available as free out-of-copyright PDFs from sites like Internet Archive or Project Gutenberg. Ask your instructor if they allow these older editions.

, Refurbished computers run as smoothly as brand new ones for a fraction of the cost. However, you should do your homework first. Only buy refurbished products from trusted retailers like Apple or Best Buy, which offer warranties and free repairs on known issues., There’s no rule that you have to buy school supplies in July and August. Each time you’re shopping for groceries or picking up a prescription, stop by the school supply aisle to look for unannounced discounts on common required supplies."
"
Ask other friends and family members what they have that they do not need anymore.,
Try websites that post free items.,
If you work somewhere that is getting rid of its stationery supplies (such as for a change in logo or address), ask your boss if the spare, unwanted items can be donated to the school.,
Ask for free promotional giveaway items.",How to Save On School Supplies2," Start at home with older brothers and sisters, then ask grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins, friends, and so forth. Specific requests, asked nicely, can sometimes yield great results.


You may be doing them a favor--sometimes people have quite a stash of items that are too good to get rid of, but also do not want to just throw out.
Also consider people who have access to get items inexpensively. Maybe your cousin who works at a store has a 20% employee discount, and would be happy to help you get a great price on items there.

,


Check your local Freecycle.org website for items people are giving away for free. You can also make requests, if necessary.
Craigslist.org is also a site in which people in a local area sell items (typically inexpensively) or even for free.
Also check websites which are community-based. For instance, in Vermont, USA there is frontporchforum.com, which has bulletin postings based on one's town.

, Paper, envelopes, 3-ring binders, folders, and more can be re-used without having to buy new.


Warning: never take stationery or other office supplies from work without asking, though, or you could lose your job for stealing.
Usually offices are happy to no have to throw away office supplies, and may even qualify for a tax write-off.

, Businesses will often have free notepads, pens, pencils, sticky notes, and water bottles at various events or in-store. Although you are unlikely to get ""big ticket"" items this way, these items are free!

Inquire about help with school supplies if you're low income.,
Try talking to the teacher.,
Talk to your school principal about the school joining the National Association for the Exchange of Industrial Resources (USA) or a similar organization in your country.",How to Save On School Supplies3," Ask your child's school for information on any community programs that are distributing free school supplies. Typically this is requires a family to already be identified as low-income. However, even if you do not qualify for some reason, school staff may be able to point you to resources for the community in general.

, Teachers are usually aware that for some families, school supplies are a real financial hardship. He or she can often help you out--but only if you speak up.


For example, faculty in schools often have ""lost and found"" items put aside from last year for those in need. Or even donations from different organizations.
Teachers will often have an extra supply of items for students. A savvy middle school math teacher will have multiple calculators squirreled away for kids who do not have access to one.
Many teachers in the United States pay for school supplies from their own pockets, often because they know some families simply cannot afford to.

, These organizations collect overstocked donations from businesses and redistribute them to nonprofit organizations, like schools.

Recycle and reuse where possible.,
Make your own pencil cases, laptop cases, backpacks, etc., using materials already available at home.,
Decorate plain (but less expensive) supplies for a personalized touch.,
If uniforms are required, use the school's used uniform distribution system.,
Textbooks can be very expensive, so search for second-hand.",How to Save On School Supplies4," Before you even consider shopping, see what you already have. Consider reusing and recycling where possible:


Go through last year's supplies and salvage what is still good to use. Clean, mend, and redecorate as necessary.What do you have on hand already? Does your child really need a new backpack if he is fine with the one he has already?

Cover all books in recycled paper. Brown paper bags are free in many stores, and still the ""old school"" choice.
Wash, clean, and stitch up any tears or holes in backpacks, lunch bags, etc. to give them another year's use. Fun patches may be a way to make a backpack look customized, rather than just mended.

Note however, that trying to reuse old reusable lunch bags from last school year may not be a good idea. Fabric, plastic, and cooler-type lunch containers can harbor mold and bacteria, so reuse them only as long as they can be cleaned thoroughly.
Make sure your child's backpack is still suitable. A backpack used since fourth grade may no longer be appropriate for a child going into the 6th or 7th grade. Starting in middle school, students typically have a lot more stuff to carry with them, and the backpack will need to be big and sturdy enough.



, Many of these items will be as sturdy as the commercial equivalents, and sometimes better.

, Make boring binders, folders, and notebooks more exciting by adding embellishments using markers, stickers, scrap fabric and paper, etc. This can be a big part of the fun of getting the supplies ready to go. Middle school and high school students should label binders and notebooks clearly with class names (History, German, Algebra, etc.) as well as one's personal name--if the notebook is lost on the bus it is more likely to get to your student if there is a name on it.

, Most schools with uniforms will have a uniform reuse system in place, and the clothing will be in good condition.

, If you have to purchase a textbook, or a copy of a certain book, costs can rise rapidly. New textbooks and books are typically the most expensive, but used books cost a lot less.


Check Amazon.com for used books. This is a worldwide market for textbooks, books, and more of all kids, and you can save a lot of money.
Pay attention to the edition. If your professor asks for the 6th edition, often the 5th edition is almost identical, and a fraction of the price. Sometimes editions really are different, but more often or not changes are minor.
Sometimes books are available through your local library. Even if it is not available in your town, inter-library loan may be able to get the work to you for free. The one problem is if someone mid-semester puts a hold on your book.
See if your school's library has a copy of the textbook required. Many schools actually have the textbooks available. However, they may sometimes not be allowed out of the library or have other restrictions.

",How to Buy School Supplies for High School," School supplies can be quite costly, so you will need to have an adequate budget. Ask your parents to help out if they can.;
, If you have items already, use them instead of buying a duplicate. Save money and time!

, When you are looking at school supplies, check the quality of the items. Will the folders rip or tear in your backpack? Is the spiral wire bound to come undone when you are using a notebook? If you buy supplies that don't last you through the year, you will become disorganized and forced to fork out more money. Check to see that what you are buying will stand up to some wear and tear. Even if it costs a little more, it may be better savings in the long run, especially if it lasts all year, or even into the following year.

, Often, schools will give you a list of needed supplies before you arrive. If so, make sure to get everything on the list. The list is useful because it also helps you to avoid buying things you don't need, and you can keep that money for other things.


If your school does not give you a list, use common sense. You will need a notebook or binder for most subjects, as well as a folder.

, Some courses may require special materials (for example, a graphics package or a laboratory coat). In these cases, it may be best to consult with a teacher or student who has taken the course to ensure you get the right materials.


Is it possible to get used items? For some things, such as expensive textbooks or clothing, hand-me-downs might be the best option. Many schools run used sales groups or stalls for just such purposes; inquire at the front office.

, If you don't already have a backpack, rucksack or satchel, get one that will last a few years at least. Choose dark colors as these won't mark as easily. Check for sturdy zippers, flaps, tabs, etc. so that things can't fall out and won't bust easily.


Check for sales on bags. You can spend a lot of money on bags, so it's wise to see what's on offer for less.

, If possible, test them before you buy. This can save you time and trouble when you go to write. Once you find one style you like, buy multiples so you don't run out, or have a replacement for a lost utensil.


Buy pens in blue and black for writing. Most teachers correct in another color (such as red, green, orange, etc.) , and thus prefer for students to use black or blue ink.

, Fill it with: different pencils, blue, black and red pens, a geometry set (protractor, compass, triangle rulers, 15cm rulers etc.), sharpener with a top to collect shavings, a 30 centimeter (11.8 in) ruler, erasers (the ones that slot onto the back of your pencils are perfect), colored pens and pencils and a calculator.

, These may include but are not limited to: binder clips, a stapler, index cards, rubber bands, scissors, a three hole punch, an eraser, and tape.


Get a few plastic art folders for homework. A4 size is the best option.

, Some schools provide a planner and require students to use it as a hall pass etc. but you may not find it one that you like. Choose something that is portable, and that you will write things down in.

, This is for dinner money, emergency supply money, etc. if relevant.

Have fun!",How to Create a Summer Camp at Home," Before you can start a summer camp, you will need to gauge interest in the camp for both parents and other children in the neighborhood. Depending on the age and number of attendees, there should be at least one adult to supervise during each day of the camp.There should be one adult available to supervise for every ten 6- to 8-year-old attendees.;
, You don’t want anyone to feel excluded, but if all camp attendees are relatively close to the same age, they’re much more likely to have fun over the camp session.It’s also preferable that all of the attendees already know each other from school, as family friends, etc.

, Once you have gauged interest in the camp, you can use that information to decide on a length for the camp. Say nine kids want to join, and five parents are each willing to host for one day. You can easily set up a five-day long camp session with one parent handling supervision duties each day.

, If all of the campers are into the same new superhero movie or if they’re all friends who share a similar interest, consider picking a theme for the camp.This can help inspire ideas for activities, decorations, art projects, and lots of other camp-related items.

, Just because you have parents willing to host certain days of the camp, that doesn’t mean they’ll want it at their homes. Find out if each parent would prefer to create activities around their house or take the children on a field trip for their assigned days.


You can also use this time to gather activity ideas from all the parents to make a list of potential camp festivities.

, With a theme and some great locations in mind, you’re ready to create a full list of potential activities for campers. Try to think of creative ways to incorporate your camp’s theme into the camp. Make sure you also pick activities appropriate to the age of the campers.


For a sports camp, consider minor league sporting events in your town; availability of baseball, softball, or basketball courts at local parks; drills related to practicing skills; sports trivia games; local sports museums or hall of fame sites; etc.
For a superhero or other theme camp, consider decorating locations to match the theme (or having campers create decorations with craft projects), screening related movies, having a themed scavenger hunt (such as clues the Riddler might leave for Batman or clues to a buried treasure for a pirate theme), drawing or coloring contests for the hero’s likeness, tag-based games where the campers are put in hero and villain teams, boardgames or Lego projects that relate to the theme, etc.
For an art camp, consider letting students sculpt with clay, design their own t-shirts with stencils or markers, learn about a specific artist or style, visit an art museum, etc.For camps with younger campers, focus on easier crafting projects and games, coloring activities, less structured events, and providing plenty of space to run around.

, Once you have a list of campers, parents to host, and a list of potential activities, you’re ready to finalize a schedule of events for the camp. Consult your list of ideas from other campers and parents and add a good variety. If you’re planning the camp far enough in advance, then consider taking a vote on the list to find out what will most interest the campers.

, With your schedule in place, you’ll know exactly what you need as far as supplies for the camp. Don’t forget food for all of the campers and decorations to match your theme.


A party supply store is a great spot to find inexpensive decorations to match any number of themes.If you come up with items that each camper will need to provide—such as a sleeping bag or enough cash for lunch during a field trip—then make sure to communicate this list to all of the parents as soon as you know. The more notice they have the better.
Always make sure a first aid kit is included in the general supplies just to be safe.

, You can build a fort or set up tents in addition to putting up your decorations. This is something you can do in advance, but building a fort can also be a fun activity, so you might want to wait for the campers to arrive.

, Especially if your camp is more than one day, not every camper may come each day. Make sure you keep a list of exactly who shows up for camp each day. This way the parent in charge knows how many kids to account for, feed, etc.

, In addition to knowing who will attend camp each day, the adult in charge should also keep a list of emergency contact numbers for each camper, as well as a list of any relevant allergies or dietary restrictions.

, Campers will work up big thirsts and appetites. Make sure to bring plenty of snacks and water, especially if any of the events are away from home, such as a nature walk., There is bound to be plenty of downtime between activities, while driving, while waiting for food, etc. Keep cards, boardgames, coloring books, and other toys on hand to keep the campers entertained while the adult host transitions between events.

, One of the great things about camp is also the spontaneity of some of the activities. Don’t worry about adhering to the schedule at the possible cost of other fun. Let the campers get creative and even improvise some of their own fun in the moment.

, Camp traditions are what set many different summer camps apart. Over the day (or several days) of camp, have the campers come up with a camp name, a song, a mascot, and any traditions they want to uphold. It will make the experience that much more fun.


One of your activities on the first day can even be to have campers make a sign for the camp on a poster or another creative surface.

, If your camp will last several days, then make sure each camper goes home at night with a reminder list for what they will need to bring the next day.


You should also try to provide a general list reminding campers to bring sun screen, swimwear, towels, baseball gloves, or any other relevant necessities based on the theme of your camp.

, Most of all, pay attention to the campers. Try to keep everyone at camp involved, engaged, and having fun. If this means changing plans at the last minute in the name of fun, go for it. Ultimately the summer camp is for the campers, so get their feedback and don’t be afraid to try new things!

Plan ahead.,
Get some rest.,
Bring magazines or books.,
Pack some entertainment.,
If you have a DVD player or laptop, charge it before you go and bring some DVDs.,
Bring some pens and paper.,
Pack the right foods.,
Pack two bags.,
Talk to the people with you.,
Enjoy some snacks, along with bottled water.,
Avoid salty foods.,
Don't fight with your siblings.,
Share.,
If you have your phone, text and call people, or play phone charades.,
Take pictures.,
Have fun.,
Wear your seat belt.,
Don't distract your driver.,
Don't embark on a long car journey with an incapable driver.",How to Deal With a Long Vacation Car Ride (Teens)," Planning ahead will make you have a more enjoyable car ride.


Dress comfortably, don't wear makeup (if your parents let you. You aren't really going out in public anywhere, and people can't see you really well through your car window.), and relax. If you must wear makeup, just apply a tiny bit of lip gloss or chap stick. Rest stops are full of people dressed casually. No one will care if you go into a store wearing your pajamas.
Charge electronics the day before, and pack a charger for the car.;
, It is recommended that you get some rest before the car ride as it is very hard to sleep in a moving car for many people and because you are less likely to enjoy the sights to see if you can barely hold your eyes open. But, in the situation where there is a very long car ride ahead of you (ex. 7+ hours), you may want to stay up so that you can sleep through the boring drive.

, Buy a few books and/or magazines before you go, as reading also helps time pass, and puts you into another world. However, you should skip this step if you get carsick easily.

, Bring a small bag full of gaming consoles, magazines, magnetic board games and other things you'll enjoy. Pack a few healthy snacks such as cut carrots or nuts to keep you full.


Make sure all of your electronics are charged! This includes your iPod, gaming console, laptop, and any other device you may bring with you. You don't want your device to die and still have 6 hours until you get to your destination.

, Don't forget headphones or earphones though! The last thing you want is to be forced to stop the DVD because it's too loud or inappropriate for a younger sibling, or too annoying/childish/distracting for anyone.

, Drawing can really help pass the time and you can even write in a journal about your time on a road trip. If you have trouble writing while in motion, press your paper against the window or seat and press firmly.

, Try bringing a healthier snack instead of candy or chips, because it will help keep you from getting sick and will also keep you fuller. Some good foods are cut carrots, raisins, assorted nuts, and apples.


Don't bring chocolate or any other kind of candy that can melt- it'll make a huge mess.

, A backpack or suitcase for your clothes (to put in the trunk) and a small shoulder bag for on-the-road entertainment (to keep with you) this way you won't have to root through clothes to find something to do.

, Discuss what you want to do as soon as you get to the destination, or talk about anything; it really passes the time. Try and make the most of what you have, so the people around you can't be so bad. Try playing a game to take your mind off the toilet if you need to go to the restroom!

, Staying hydrated is important, but make sure to pay attention to when the next rest stop is.

, Salty food will make you thirsty and being thirsty means having to drink more water, which means going to the bathroom more often. Only eat salty foods if you know there will be a rest stop close by.

, It makes things tougher for everyone. Someone is going to get hurt, and the driver will get distracted.

, Make sure you keep your sibling entertained too because you do not want to have to listen to complaints or be called self-centered.

, You can also play pictionary with your siblings if you have a drawing app on your cell phone or iPod.

, If you have a camera, bring it along and take pictures of all the amazing sites you see or even of you and your family. They will keep memories and later you could make a scrapbook if you want.

, Don't be grumpy either. No one wants to be stuck in a car with someone who complains every 5 minutes.

, Seat belts prevent death and help you survive car accidents. Wear your belt properly and use a booster seat if you need to in order for the seat belt to be effective. Do not forsake safety for comfort.

, You are more likely to survive a long car journey as a teen if you don't distract the car driver in any way. Allow them to concentrate on reaching your destination safely.

, It is tempting, as a teen, to head off on a road trip with your mates but ensure who ever is driving is a competent, licensed, insured driver with a vehicle in good working order.

Choose your moment.,
Request a dance.,
Wait for her response.,
Take the floor.",How to Slow Dance at a Formal or Semi Formal Dance1," A slow song will be easiest for you to sync your movements when dancing. Consider something romantically themed or significant to your partner, like a favorite song.


Some DJs accept requests. Requesting a song and asking when that song will be played will help you time your approach.;
, Make full eye contact with you dance partner. Ask her if she would like to dance, but try to make your request in a way that is true to yourself. This will let her know that this is a special moment you want to share with her. You might ask:


May I have the pleasure of this dance?
I would be honored if you would do me the pleasure of having this dance.
There's no one else I'd rather dance with. Shall we?

, It's important that you respect her decision, no matter the outcome. Just as it was difficult for you to ask, it will likely be difficult for her to refuse and hurt your feelings. If you notice hesitation, try to be graceful, and never force yourself on your partner.


It can alleviate a lot of stress if you come up with a backup plan before making your request. Approach a friend you are comfortable with and explain your situation.If your friend is willing to be your backup, even if you get shot down, you can still have a blast on the dance floor.

Be careful not to lead on your friend romantically. Some may have hidden feelings with you, and if this is the case, they may interpret your request as insensitive.



, Hold out your hand to escort her to the dance floor. Wait until she takes your hand, walking slightly ahead of her to lead her to your spot on the floor.

"
"
Place your hands.,
Lead or follow the leading partner.,
Make eye contact.,
Use tact.,
Do not force her movements.",How to Slow Dance at a Formal or Semi Formal Dance2," When you arrive at your dance spot, turn to her and place your hands on her hips. She should put her hands either on your shoulders or interlace her hands together behind your neck.


Another option for hand placement: take her hand with your left hand and hold it off to the side, while your free hand can be placed below her shoulder blade on her back. Her right hand will be in yours, and her left hand should be on your waist, shoulder, or below the shoulder blade on your back., This will give your dancing a more coordinated look, and is simple to perform.Keeping your feet largely stationary, shift your weight back and forth to sway with your partner.


Leading, in dance, is mostly about connection and commitment. Maintain your sway to the beat of the music, think about your motions, and if moving your feet, direct your partner by applying slight pressure with your hands.
Following, in dance, requires you to read your partner and follow through steps initiated by the lead. If he holds his hand up for a twirl, try to follow the motion into a single controlled spin that ends back in default position.

, Sharing such closeness can be a vulnerable and exciting experience. Show her she has your undivided attention by looking deeply into her eyes, or leaning forward and telling her something sweet. Consider telling her:


Your dress is absolutely beautiful.
I've been looking forward to sharing this dance with you for a while.
I can't believe I get to dance with the prettiest girl in the room.

, Though a slow dance is a nice step toward a more romantic relationship, it's easy for you to get carried away in the moment and come on too strong.Try to avoid uncomfortable topics or any sexual suggestions, even if you feel the urge to. You don't want to give the wrong impression, or ruin your chances with someone you might have been a good match with.

, Leading on the dance floor does not translate to strong-arming. It's perfectly alright if she misses some steps; at this point, you're both still learning each others' style. If she voluntarily puts her head on your shoulder, this is generally an indication she's comfortable with more cuddly contact.


The closer you and your partner's bodies become, the more you will need to wrap around her waist, and she around your neck. If you are dancing cheek-to-cheek, your arms will almost completely wrap her waist, and hers should do the same around the back of your neck.

"
"
Place your hands.,
Practice beforehand.,
Perform the step in time with the music.,
Be respectful.",How to Slow Dance at a Formal or Semi Formal Dance3," For this step you should use the closed position, where the lead will put his right hand below his partner's shoulder blade on her back, with his left hand raised off to the side so his partner can put her hand in it.Holding a partner in the closed position can limit confusion while executing this step, as you can apply slight pressure with your fingertips to indicate direction of movement.
Classic technique requires you to keep your thumbs pointed, not curled to grip your partner.This will help you maintain proper posture.

, Familiarizing yourself with the step and becoming comfortable with it will allow you to lead with confidence, which usually translates on the dance floor as graceful dancing. Your feet and those of your partner will trace a box patter on the floor, each step occupying one of the four corners of the box, beginning with the lower left hand corner of the box. Lead and follow steps are:


Lead:

Left foot forward to second corner
Right foot to the right to third corner
Left foot joins right at third corner
Right foot back to fourth corner
Left foot to the left, returning to starting corner
Right foot joins left


Follow:

Right foot back to second corner
Left foot to the left to the third corner
Right foot joins left at third corner
Left foot forward to fourth corner
Right foot to the right, returning to starting corner
Left foot joins right., Make sure you have enough room. This step, unlike the simple sway-step slow dance, requires space for you and your partner to perform the steps. Choose your dancing spot wisely, and impress your friends with your new moves.This step, sometimes called a box-waltz, is suited for music written to a three beat time signature. Count in your head one-two-three, and if your count fits that of the music evenly, the music is likely in a time signature you can box-step to., New dancers can get caught up in the moment and lose track of others on the dance floor. This can cause accidental injury to yourself, your partner, or others. Try to remain aware of those around you, and always treat your partner with courtesy.

Remember you are only on holiday for six - eight weeks, or even only twelve weeks.",How to Cope over the Summer Holidays," Summer camps are a great way of taking up weeks of your holidays. Look for posters and listen out for school to see if there are any that take your fancy. No matter what you're interested in and what level you intend to reach, there's always something out there for you whether it's dancing, music, sports, art or cooking. Be aware that summer camps are virtually non-existent outside North America so don't set your heart on coping with summer by going to camp if you live in UK or anywhere else where summer camps are rare;

Try focusing on the number of days decreasing until you get to go back. Enjoy spending lazy, indulgent time in bed if you like. Read in bed in the mornings when on a school day you'd have to rush about getting ready to leave the house to be on time.

, If a slow song comes on ask her to dance with you. If shes shy tell her to not worry about it, just don't make her do anything she don't want to do or don't pressure her to dance or anything. If she says no the first time then don't get upset about it, ask her if she is nervous about it and if she says yes or kinda then tell her every thing is going to be all right she is with you and that's all that matters and if she still says no then she's just really shy. 

, If you're at a school dance and the drinks cost money, ask her if she wants one. If you guys are at a formal dance do the exact same thing, but depending on the occasion of the dance the drinks might not cost anything. Just make sure you have money on you.

, Give her some room to see or hang out with her friends, she should do the same with you too. And don't just hang around your friends that will make her feel like you're the one in control of the date. But that doesn't mean she is there. You are both in control of the date, let her know that.

, Girls love it when boys are romantic. Maybe get her a rose or two before you head to the dance or before you pick her up. A corsage will also be nice if you don't think a rose will do.

, She is your date you should be proud of her. Introduce her to your friends and have her introduce you to her friends if she hasn't already. Girls love showing their boyfriends off to there friends and they like to also give hint to every other girl there that you are hers not theirs.

, Don't flirt with other girls. Girls are very territorial even if your girl doesn't seem like the jealous type.

, Don't forget to have fun with her, many boys are so worried about what they're doing wrong that they forget what they're doing right.

, Make her feel wanted and that she made the right choice to go with you.

Get your work done.,

Don't decorate too early.,
When you do decide to decorate, decorate to your heart's content!,
Don't see Christmas Cards and presents as a chore!,
When Christmas Eve rolls around, have some fun things planned.,
Keep Christmas day free, or only have one or two visits to very dear friends or relatives planned.,
Get your friends small gifts like lip balms, mini nail polish, key-rings, small accessories, CD/DVDs, etc.,
Enjoy the presents you get.,
Pamper yourself.,
Enjoy your Christmas!",How to Celebrate Christmas (As a Girl)," Nothing drives down Christmas day like the knowledge you've got fourteen essays to write between now and the start of term. Yes, they're boring, but get them done BEFORE the Christmas season really kicks off and trust me, you'll be glad you did later.;
, If possible, try to meet up with some you haven't seen in a while. Do whatever you like best to catch up with them, whether it's bowling, ice skating, shopping or watching a film round your house with a tub of ice cream.

, Lots of places need extra help around the holiday and winter season, and you'll be helping people in need. It will make you feel better about yourself and your current life situation, whatever it may be. If you can't find the time to volunteer, at least donate a winter coat to a homeless shelter or drop a few dollars into the Salvation Army tins.Why not do something extra this Christmas, either a stall on the street (why not sell mince pies?), or collect sponsors for running, dancing, skipping, or anything for about 1 hour. Donate your money to a charity, and you will feel good about helping someone.

, What defines too early varies from person to person, but at least wait until after Halloween. If you start decorating too early, by Christmas you'll be tired of the decorations. They're special because they aren't up year round. Most people start in late November or early December.

, Decorate your bedroom and ask your parents if you can set up some of the decorations they typically do, such as arranging a table centerpiece. And don't forget to decorate the tree! Some people like to do this with family and others with friends, so do whichever you prefer, or whichever is tradition in your family. Why not make your own decoration?

, Write a list of names and tick off each name when you have written them a card. You can use the same list year after year! Some people find writing cards fun, others find it boring. Picking cute cards, sparkly paper and picturing the smile on their face will make you feel better! Send cards to as many people as possible!

, It's okay to go hang out at the mall on Christmas Eve, but make sure all of your shopping is done before then. Shopping for presents or things you need on Christmas, on Christmas Eve, will only frustrate you. You could also go see a movie, visit a friend or relative, or see if you can help out around the house.

, It will be trying to have to go to a hundred appointments.

, Get your special friends something more expensive, depending on what they want/like.

, So maybe that too-big jumper that is made from itchy wool doesn't suit you and isn't the best present you've ever got, but be grateful. Many people don't even have a home or food, never mind presents. Thank the gift giver and they'll feel better, with any necessary hugs, making you feel better in the process. Scowling and saying it isn't what you wanted will only make the entire day awkward, and it will ruin everyone's holiday.

, Whether that means a bubble bath with nice shampoo, eating tons of good food, cuddling with a dog or stuffed animal, or watching a favorite movie, go ahead and do it!

, It only comes once a year, after all!

Enjoy the freedom.,
Revel in the lack of awkwardness.,
Love yourself and all your quirks.,
Appreciate small things.",How to Have Fun Alone1," To use your alone time to its fullest, you need to begin by embracing it. Learn to love the benefits being alone brings and resolve yourself to have a positive attitude about it.


Embrace being able to do, say, think, or act however you want. When you’re by yourself, you don’t have to worry about the thoughts or judgments of others. You can be utterly and unabashedly yourself and never think twice about what someone else might think or say.
Love the independence that comes with having time to yourself. You don’t have to take anyone else’s tastes, preferences, or desires into account when making your decisions. If you want to watch terrible reality television, no one can whine about it or beg you to change the channel. If you want to go for an extra-long walk or jog, no one can complain about how long you were out or hijack your plans.
Savor not having to look good for anyone. If you want to spend all day in your pajamas with messy hair and unbrushed teeth, do it! No one will be the wiser and no one can look at sideways at your unicorn slippers.;
, Being around people usually means enduring at least some degree of awkwardness some of the time.


Being alone, on the other hand, means never having to dodge awkward questions about your dating life or listen to someone tell you all about their cat’s agoraphobia., Having time to yourself gives you the chance to step back from all the frantic activity of daily life and interactions. You have time to actually be with yourself--and appreciate your own company.


To fully enjoy your time alone, decide to let yourself truly be who you are. Embrace your quirks--talk to yourself, talk to your chair, do a weird dance while you brush your teeth, slide rather than walk whenever possible, etc. And then take time to really appreciate what an awesome and unique person you are.Start defining yourself by your own unique qualities rather than by your relationships or other people’s opinions. Being alone gives you the chance to really consider yourself for who you are, apart from other people., Another big part of enjoying your alone time is starting to notice and appreciate small things in your life. Being away from the distractions of others lets you pay attention to small details you might otherwise overlook or forget to notice.Take time to look around you. Notice as many small, fine details as you can. Be aware of the small things that bring you pleasure and then take a moment to really absorb and enjoy that pleasure.
Be observant of yourself. Pay attention to small shifts in your mood, thoughts, feelings, and perceptions. Try to pinpoint what led to that shift and how it affected you physically and emotionally. As you get more tuned in to yourself and what makes you tick, you’ll start to gain insights into yourself you may have never realized before.

Wear comfortable clothing.,
Float in a pool or on a lake or boat.,
Watch TV and movies.,
Sleep in.,
Have some friends over.,
Do nothing!,
Have a party at your house.,
Take a bath or shower.,
Take up a relaxing hobby.",How to Be Lazy During Summer Vacation," It's hard to be lazy if your pants itch and you get very sweaty in your shirt that doesn't fit right, so wear loose t-shirts and shorts. Don't even think about putting any shoes on. Bare feet are ideal for laziness, especially in the summer.;
, Lie on your back or on an inner tube and let yourself relax. This lets off steam and relaxes your entire body.

, If you're looking for a big project, consider buying or renting an entire television season.

, During the school year, you probably had to get up early for school and stay up late doing homework. On summer vacation, you don't have any commitments or things to do. It's the perfect time to catch up on your sleep.

, Talk at home, play video games, or go window shopping. Having a fun companion can keep you company if you're bored and help you relax.

, Waste time or live in the moment. Try to take a nap or just sit on the couch and think! If thinking is too tiring, just lay back and relax!

, If you have a birthday in the summer, this can be more relaxing since you don't have to go anywhere and it's cheaper! If possible, have your parents leave the house, go on a date, or something to keep you and your friends to your privacy. This is a great way to chill, especially if you have over-protective parents!

, Having a bath or shower is the perfect time to relax and think.

, Try knitting or coin collecting.

Decide who is going on this holiday.,
What kind of holiday are you all after?,
Look at locations.,
Make sure to answer the following questions before booking a trip:


What dates are you able to all go on?,
Go into a travel agent on the high street, or do a search online, and check for availability on the dates you and your party have selected, from your chosen airport, to your chosen destination.

,
If the prices are higher than you thought, remember with the recent increase in fuel prices all tour operators have to charge an additional fuel price.

,
If you get a costing from a travel agent, ask to see the breakdown, then you will know exactly what you are paying for.

,
To save money, take off the resort transfers, flight meals and extra luggage allowance.

,
Also if you are in a big group, don't think that it is essential to stay in a hotel on the main strip, as more often than not these hotels are very noisy and you will get no peace.,
Ask travel agents about group discounts.,
When your holiday is booked, do some research on the internet so you know all the local information, the currency they use in the resort, how long it will take to get from the airport to the resort etc.

,
Ensure you plan in advance, your holiday money as you can always bring it back with you if you don’t spend it all!,
To get the most out of your holiday, pick up a brochure and take it with you, then you have all the details you could ever need to hand including all the booking terms and conditions.

",How to Book Your First Holiday Abroad Without Your Parents," Is it just you and a friend or a few of you from school/college/work?;
, Is it a celebration because your all leaving school? a chill out week on a beach? clubbing until the sunrise? or seeing some traditional places on a Greek island perhaps?

, Browse the web for various travel deals.

,
Do you want to go for one week or two?
Which airports are best for you to ALL fly from?
What is everyone’s budget?

,,,,, Check out hotels a few minutes, walk from the nightlife, because then you will have the best of both worlds, and also get to see more of the resort you are staying in.

, If there is 3 in a room it should work out cheaper.


If it is just you and a friend traveling, ask about low season deals.
When you agree a price and pay a deposit, ensure you know exactly what’s included in the price and what isn’t. Do you have travel insurance?
Also, when do you have to pay the final balance? how do you do that? Over the phone, in the shop etc.

,, Travelers Cheque’s are still the safest way of taking money abroad, and a lot of people will advise you to get the Travelers Cheque card that you can use abroad but be aware these are still very new and in a lot of resorts, especially Greece - not widely accepted.

Start a blog.,
Experiment in the kitchen.,
Make a painting or a drawing.,
Make a scrapbook.,
Write a book.",How to Have Fun Alone2," It could be about your favorite movies, games, bands, books, computers, celebrities--anything that piques your interest. Do a search for “free blogging platforms,” choose a design that fits with the theme of your blog, and come up with a creative title.If your blog features content that’s fun to gather and write, chances are it will be fun for others to read. Put a link to your first post on Facebook so your friends can leave comments.
The great thing about starting a blog is that it can provide endless amounts of entertainment. Update it with new posts every time you find yourself with some time to spare.

, There’s no pressure to make something perfect, since you’re only cooking for one.Make a recipe you’ve always wanted to try or cook up something simple and satisfying like an omelette or pasta alfredo.Try creating your own unique dish without using a recipe at all. Start with a base like pasta or rice and add in your favorite ingredients or things you’ve wanted to try, like kale, tomatillos, buffalo meat, or chia seeds.
Try making a single chocolate chip cookie and savor the chance to make a cookie that’s only for you.

, Go to a craft store and buy a few supplies or just use pencil and paper that you have around the house.


If you aren’t artistically inclined, get a paint-by-number set. They’re fun and satisfying to complete, and when you’re done you’ll have a new decoration for your room.
Make a comic strip or a web comic. Use yourself, celebrities, family, or friends as inspiration for the characters. You can make your comic artistically detailed or use messy stick figures. Put them into funny and ridiculous situations, and then show them to your friends.

, If you have boxes full of photographs, ticket stubs, restaurant menus, and other random knick-knacks, take some time to make a scrapbook.


Buy a blank scrapbook from an art store or a drugstore.
Lay out the items you want to save by date and category.
Arrange the items artfully and then paste them into the scrapbook.
Consider adding witty or sentimental captions.

, The time may never come again when you will have such perfect loneliness--so make the most of it. The silence may help you concentrate. If writing a book seems like too much to take on, try something smaller but equally expressive:


Write a journal entry or start a new journal.
Write a letter to someone you haven’t seen in a long time.
Make a list of your goals for the next month or year.

Take yourself out for a meal.,
Take a long bath or shower.,
Get your nails done.,
Get some sleep.",How to Have Fun Alone3," There’s no reason to be shy about going out to eat alone. In fact, it can be pretty nice to go wherever you want, order whatever you want, drink whatever you want, and have a whole table to yourself.If you feel like being a bit social, sit at the bar to eat. People sitting at the bar tend to be friendlier and more open--and to have better stories.Go to one of your favorite restaurants and order the meal you’ve been craving. Bring a book along if you’d like, or enjoy your meal while people-watching.

, If your house is usually full of people waiting to use the bathroom, take this time to spend as long as you want in the bathroom. Use all of your favorite bath and body products.


Draw a bath and pour in some bubble bath or your favorite essential oil. Light candles, turn on music, and allow yourself to relax or have a leisurely shower.

, Make an appointment at a salon or walk in for a spur-of-the-moment treat.


If you don’t want to spend money on a manicure, give yourself one at home. Don’t just paint your nails, give yourself the works: file your nails, soak them, and use several coats of polish. If you still have time and supplies left over, give yourself a pedicure, too.

, Having time all to yourself offers a great opportunity for sleep--take advantage!


Indulge in an afternoon nap, or go to bed as early as you want.
If you’re alone in the morning, sleep in or wake up make breakfast and go back to bed, breakfast in bed!

Catch up on responsibilities.,
Learn a new skill.,
Take a class.,
Call someone you haven't talked to in a while.,
Meditate or simply take some time to think.",How to Have Fun Alone4," The best thing about ""me time"" is that you're not going to have any interruptions. Catch up on school work, study for an upcoming test, clean your room, get your finances squared away, etc. Use this time to your advantage.Reorganizing a room can be a lot of fun. Once everything is clean, rearrange the furniture to give the room a new look. Put up new decorations to freshen things up.
Create a new color-coded filing system to organize your papers, or make a calendar and fill it in with all your plans for the next few months.

, If you make time to practice a skill every time you’re alone, you may end up getting quite good at it.Is there a guitar lying around the house or a piano that rarely gets played? Put it to use!
Try your hand at logic games and puzzles. There are plenty to choose from online and a number of logic puzzle apps available for smartphones.
Or you could get a little retro with a Rubik’s Cube and work your way towards genius.

, Learn a skill you’ve always wanted to develop or find a topic you’re curious about and take a class on it.


Many free and low-cost classes are available online as well as at many community centers.
Free courses often don’t require any homework or tests, so if the grading part of taking a class puts you off, take one where you don’t have to worry about it.

, Catch up on phone calls to your relatives and friends who live in other places.Email or text them if you don’t want to make a phone call. Having time alone is a great opportunity to reconnect with people you’ve fallen out of touch with.

, Having time to yourself away from other distractions allows you to slow down and turn inward--giving you a perfect chance to let yourself do some quiet reflecting.Think through decisions that have been weighing on you lately. What are the pros and cons of the options before you? Write them down if that helps you sort through your thoughts.
Use your imagination. Go to a different place in your head and imagine a different world. Allow yourself to daydream. You may even come up with a great new idea for a story or a blog post.

Meditate. Sit quietly, close your eyes, and pay attention to the sounds, smells, and sensations around you. Let your mind go blank and concentrate on your breathing.

Window shop.,
Take your time.,
Visit stores you’ve never been to.,
Talk to salespeople.",How to Have Fun at the Mall by Yourself1," Window-shopping is a great way to spend time without spending money. When you window shop, you can glean inspiration for how to use existing items, make a mental note of items you might want to purchase later, or satisfy your curiosity about a new season’s items and trends.You don’t have to go to the mall with the intention of window shopping, but it can turn into that when you don’t have friends pressuring or urging you to purchase something.;
, One of the greatest benefits of shopping solo is the ability to take as long as you want. When you shop with others, you have to work on a shared timetable, but when you are on your own, you can linger in your favorite part of a store, try clothes on multiple times to get a clear idea of what you like, or even just wander around.You can also go as fast as you’d like. If you walk into a store and don’t like what you see, walk right back out! You do not have to wait around for someone else to finish browsing.

, Being alone is a great excuse to visit a store you’ve never been to--particularly if there is a store you are too shy or embarrassed to visit with other people. You can visit a weaponry store, a joke shop, or even a lingerie shop without worrying about what your companions might think.Do not visit stores you are not permitted to. Shopping alone is a time to experience freedom from others’ timetables and wants, not a time to behave inappropriately or disobey a parent’s request.

, Ask about return policies, when new shipments come in, what types of clothing would fit your coloring or frame well, or even whether or not they like their job.


Although some sales staff will not have answers for you, they will likely find someone who does. If you are nervous buying new clothes or are unsure what to purchase for an event, get the input of an impartial third party. A friend is likely to sugarcoat opinions to spare your feelings.

Go outside and enjoy nature.,
Exercise.,
Have an adventure.",How to Have Fun Alone5," A solo walk or hike allows you to observe nature without any distractions, and you may be surprised by how enjoyable some alone time in nature can be.Visit a nearby park, lake, river, or nature preserve, especially if you’ve never been before. Take a picnic!
Go for a bike ride. There’s a surprising freedom in seeing the world from the seat of a bike. Find a quiet, scenic place or look up bike trails in your area and go explore.

, You’ve got time to yourself, so use it to get in shape. It’s an excellent way to pass the time while also improving your overall physical and mental well-being.Jog around the neighborhood or do a bit of running on the treadmill.
Look online for exercise videos, like yoga or pilates, and follow along with the instructor.
Turn on some music and dance in front of the mirror. Better yet, make up a dance, and teach it to your friends and family later.
Take up a sport you’ve never played before. Research the equipment you’ll need and find local clubs or teams you can join.
Join a gym. Going to the gym will help keep you fit while also giving you a social outlet.

, You’re beholden to no one, so find a spot on the map where you’ve never been and go there!Drive to the beach and spend your day getting a tan or swimming.
Drive to a town you’ve never seen or visit a park you’ve never been to. Take pictures so you can show people later.
Go fishing and catch some fish to show people or try cooking and eating what you catch.

Make a movie/TV/music night. Pick a theme and make your own marathon around that theme, like werewolves, 80s heartthrobs, Broadway musicals, or whatever entertains you.
After you’ve indulged in all your favorites, start researching new bands, movies, and TV shows to try. Check out music blogs and podcasts, see what Spotify or Pandora recommends, or seek out the under-explored corners of Netflix.

, If you’re not a gamer, give it a try. If you’re already a gamer, broaden your horizons.


Try playing a new video game or seeking a new video game store. Look for older or lesser-known titles in thrift stores or online.
Set up a video game tournament if you have the supplies--many platforms allow for cooperative virtual gaming, so if your friends aren’t around, you can play with new and different people from around the world.
Try new types of non-video games, like role playing games, L.A.R.P.ing (Live Action Role Playing), etc.
Revert back to your childhood self and bring out your favorite old board games. But what if you need multiple players? You can play for all of the players! Compete against yourself and take joy in knowing that you’ll win no matter what.

, Get out your old photo albums, scrapbooks, and yearbooks and spend some time reminiscing about old times.


You may even be inspired to look up old friends or family members with whom you’ve lost touch. If you are, go on an information hunt and see if you can track them down.
Use the memories that come back to you as inspiration--write them down into short stories, autobiographical snippets, blog posts, comics, etc.

, Time to yourself opens up all kinds of avenues for exploration, including digital exploration. And there’s a lot of digital world to explore.


Go for a virtual information walk. Start by opening a web page--any page--and then start exploring where it takes you. Look for terms or ideas mentioned or linked on the page and follow them. Do the same for each new page you come to and see how far away from your starting point you can get. Then revel in all the obscure knowledge you’re accumulating.
Go tutorial crazy by visiting various tutorial and how-to sites--and then trying them out. If you’re into experimenting with hair and makeup, find the craziest hair/makeup how-to you can and be your own experimental subject. If you like making things, look up tutorials on making or building things (birdhouses, crème brûlée, pillows, whatever) and give it your best shot. You may uncover some hidden talent.

Watch live music.,
Attend a book reading.,
People watch.,
Talk to a stranger.,
Watch a movie.,
Enjoy an arcade.",How to Have Fun at the Mall by Yourself2," Many malls have areas with sound equipment and a stage set up for musicians to play live shows. Some malls have large, dedicated spaces where actual concerts are staged, while others have small stages open to amateur musicians or musicians playing background music.If you play music yourself, watching amateurs perform can help you cultivate your stage presence.
If possible, bring a few dollars along to tip the musician, if you like what you hear.

, Most malls contain at least one bookstore, so see if you can find a book or poetry reading. The authors of books complete some readings themselves, but many bookstores also host readings from and for the public. These can include readings of other artists’ work, or can be readings from amateur writers of their own work.Book and poetry readings can expose you to authors you’d not heard of previously, or can inspire you to create your own work.
Make sure you are kind and respectful of others at a book reading. Be quiet, and try to stay seated until the reading has finished.

, People watching is a simple, enjoyable activity, and a mall is a great place to do it. Because most malls are high-traffic areas, you can see a wide variety of lifestyles, clothing choices, behaviors, and habits, not to mention interesting accents and conversations. Take a few minutes to people watch the next time you are at the mall on your own.People watching is great for people who like to draw or write, as you can glean ideas for personalities, characters, and faces to recreate.
Even if you are not artistically inclined, people watching can be entertaining and provide insight into how people work.

, Strike up a conversation with a stranger over a shared interest in books, a common interest in a certain clothing store, or even about the hassle of long lines in the bathroom. You do not have to become instant friends or carry on a memorable conversation. The goal is to step out of your comfort zone and enjoy an interaction with a stranger., Many malls are equipped with movie theatres, so take some time out of your day to visit a movie by yourself. You can go all out and order a large popcorn, a drink, and a lap full of snacks and see a movie. This is a particularly great idea if there is a movie you’ve been dying to see, but don’t have any friends with an interest in going.Enjoy the silence inherent in watching a movie alone. No chatting during interesting parts, or noisy slurping--you can be fully immersed in the film.

, Although arcades have fallen out of vogue to some degree, many malls still have small spaces set aside for games. Visit your mall’s arcade and try your hand at any new games they might have, or enjoy the classics such as Pac-Man."

Book a spa appointment.,
Visit a makeup counter.,
Splurge on a few treats.,
Have lunch with a favorite book.,
Get your measurements taken.,
Try out new relaxation techniques.",How to Have Fun at the Mall by Yourself3," Increasingly often, malls are welcoming spas and massage centers into their halls. Take advantage of this and get a full-body massage or facial treatment after a day of browsing through shops.Make sure you mention any medical conditions or injuries you have before booking a spa appointment. Broken skin, for instance, might disqualify you from getting a facial.

, If you like makeup, you can visit a makeup counter and get a free makeover, and ask for tips for your skin type. Many skincare counters are happy to provide these services in the hopes of selling new products, so don’t be afraid to ask for a sample of a product you might be on the fence about.This is a great option if you are looking for a makeup product to do a specific job, such as reduce under eye circles or make your lips pop.

, Visit your mall’s candy, chocolate, or pastry shop and indulge on a few treats. You can purchase a chocolate croissant and enjoy it right there, or you can stock up on some sweet treats to take home and eat throughout the next few weeks.Use this opportunity to try something new. You can ask to see any new candy or specials, or you can ask the clerks what their favorites are.

, Bring along your favorite book (or a new tome from the bookstore), and sit down to a cafeteria lunch. You can eat while you read, absorbing the sounds and smells around you while you immerse yourself in a new world.Many malls have coffee shops in them, as well, so you may even be able to cozy up in an armchair and sip a latté as you read.

, You can visit a department store and request to have your measurements taken. You can then use this information if ever you need to take an item to a tailor, order an item online, or complete alterations yourself. Although you can do your own measurements, doing so can be tricky, so why not enlist the help of a professional?Sizing is particularly important for bras, so if you wear a bra, use your time alone to find out what size you should actually be wearing.

, Malls are often used as testing grounds for new therapy machines. Hydrotherapy, therapy chairs, and therapy machines have all been known to adorn the large hallways of malls, so take a few moments to find out if you can test out a new relaxation/therapeutic technique.


Some of these can be dangerous for existing medical conditions or pregnancy. Make sure you talk to the vendor or operator about any possible risk factors before you partake.

Practice a skill.,
Take up a hobby.,
Listen to podcasts.,
Read books.,
Take a pet for a walk.,
Go for a walk on your own.",How to Have Fun After a Boring Day at School1," Learning new skills can help you out of future predicaments or impress your friends! You can try skills that capture your interest, or you can try to learn skills that are related to each other to build mastery in that area. Some suggestions for you to consider are:


Sleight of hand

Draw/paint

Juggle
Marksmanship
Fish
Martial arts
Poi
Car maintenance
Stained glass;
, Hobbies can be any activity that you do regularly for fun. A hobby can be done on your own or with others who share your interest, which can be anything from gardening to collecting moths. Some classic hobbies, like stamp collecting, might seem old fashioned, but you never know when an old or new hobby might make your time more meaningful and fun.



Origami can help you transform scrap paper into animals, shapes, ninja stars and more.

Become a puzzle master and test the strength of your mind. Try your hand at jigsaw puzzles, mechanical puzzles like a Rubik's Cube, or solve a chess puzzle.

Check out bug collecting. Entomology has been fascinating children and adults for hundreds of years.

Try creative writing or poetry. Picking up a pen and paper, you might find that filling the paper makes your time pass more pleasantly.

Take up hiking and explore your local area. Look for short cuts that you might use in the future. Take pictures with your cell phone of any cool sights and share them later with your friends or family.

Become the next crypto-expert, and learn the secrets of cryptography. Cryptography is the systematic practice of writing or breaking codes.

Pursue astronomy with a telescope and peer at the mysteries of our universe.

, This is a great way for you to delve into an area of interest while exercising or going for a walk. Podcasts can also make tedious tasks, like laundry or picking up, a lot more tolerable.

, Though you might thing of reading as a school-only exercise, reading is a proven way of relaxing.What could be better than exploring a world of your own imagining?



Speed reading is a skill you will never regret learning.
Check out comic books and graphic novels. Since the late '80s, artists have pushed the boundaries of comics to include themes more thought provoking and true to life.Even though it's a comic book, you might find you identify deeply with characters you read about, and the artistry that brings them to life.
Put on your sleuth's hat and pick up a mystery! You can watch Sherlock Holmes on TV, certainly, but you can join Sherlock Holmes in solving a mystery in a book.
Look to the future and indulge in a sci-fi adventure. These don't have to be your typical romp through outer space -- you might travel through time, or down a wormhole to another dimension eerily similar to your own.
Read biographies of people you admire and public figures you identify with. This can give you insight to their lives, and also some insight into your own.

, If you don't have a pet, you can always ask your neighbor if they might let you take their pup for a walk around the park. Taking dog for a walk has many benefits, including decreasing stress and an increased sense of well-being.Spending some time with a fuzzy companion can add some pep to your after school routine.

, Your working memory functions better when you go for a walk, which helps with reasoning, making your walk an ideal moment to puzzle out any problems you might have.Walking has many benefits for your health and mood, and walking in nature has been shown to reduce stress."

Have a Box Party!,
Go eat at the local hotspot or one of your friends' favorite places and gossip!,
Go to the mall and have a Mall Crawl!,
Hit the local cinema or go to a concert!,
Have a dance fever.,
Host a slumber party!,
Have blindfolded makeovers.,
Make a video!,
Go to the beach!,
Get your bro in the action.",How to Have a Great Girls' Night Out (Teens)," Start out the night with a box maze. Just get a bunch of boxes and cut out the sides. You can make optional dead ends, or what I like best, the Never Ending maze, that has no end and just the start. Make some holes at the top, by either making some holes with a pencil on top of each box or opening some tops all together. You can also make a Drive-In Movie, with box cars. Depending on the size of the box, it can be a 1 seater, 2 seater, or even a 4 seater! It's fun to do with your friends and see who has the coolest car. And, top the night off to see who has the coolest box invention. This is really inexpensive and great if you know someone who just moved.;
, The possibilities are endless: Starbucks, In-n-Out, or even the local crepe place around the corner. Hit a booth, order up, and dig in! This is also a great time to let the blabbermouth inside you out. Chat about your summer plans, school, and everything in between.

, Or, if you're broke, a Mall Crawl: Browsing Style. Turn it into a friendly competition. Ex: If you have six people in your group, there can be two stylists, two models, and two judges. This is best if you're at a department store. Set a time limit, have a meeting location and have the models strut their stuff! Go as loco as you want with accessories and make a quick hairdo. #*If someone in the group easily gets their feelings hurt, have them be a judge. If they want to be a stylist, warn them that whoever wins wins.

, Try to find a group or movie that everyone will enjoy. If you're spending 30-45 minutes or more trying to figure out what to watch, draw out of a hat. If you don't spend too much buying the tickets, that's more than enough left for an extra-large bucket of popcorn, right? If you're going to a concert, try to find a not-too-expensive one. Besides, who needs front row tickets to Justin Bieber for $600,000 when you could get a perfectly good view of him from your computer?

, Face the facts: every girl at some point gets dance fever. And even if you don't it's really fun to go wild: make lots of space for a dance floor, dim the lights, crank up the tunes, and get ready for an awesome time. If you can, even do some karaoke. But seriously, don't put up a song like Handlebars even if you like it. Suggestions: On the Floor, Evacuate the Dancefloor, Pump It, you get the point. You'll never forget the moment when your friends are screaming the lyrics to a song and your jumping like there's no tomorrow and your snacking on pretzels every once in a while.

, You can do most of these things at a sleepover. You can have a camp-out in the backyard, or a real camp-out. Tell ghost stories, go exploring at midnight (or whenever your parents say you can explore... but it has to be dark!) and of course, roast s'mores over a bonfire. Or, have an indoor slumber party, filled with pillow fights, laughing, and of course...

, Blindfold each other, get your makeup tools in hand, and try your best. My friend and I did it with red lipstick once, oh my gosh, we looked like the Joker who got thrown up on! Don't do it on a carpet, though. Have the camera ready. You can post pictures on Facebook or add them in your scrapbook.

, Always see those people get famous on YouTube? Try it! Make up random topics to discuss or do and get everyone in the action. Ex: Me and my friend made a random video. I used my iPhone's Fart App and we made up something called Fart App Philosophy. Or make up a remix to a song. All you need is your video cam and your friends!

, Or, if you don't have beach where you live, get out the hose and your old water toys! Who knew that completely getting drenched by ten water balloons or drenching someone else with water balloons could be so much fun? It's also fun to collect seashells, and then you can make friendship bracelets or necklaces.

, Tie him down, get out the lipstick, and scream, FOR READING MY DIARY! or something that he did. If your mom comes in, come clean and she'll hopefully understand.

Put a new spin on the same 'ol, same 'ol.,
Play board games.,
Have a cupcake party!,
Make a time capsule.,
Build a cardboard castle or clubhouse.,
Join or start a card club.",How to Have Fun After a Boring Day at School2," It can be easy for you and your friends to do the same thing over and over again. But even if you have a limited amount of resources, you can mix and match rules to your favorite games, or add to a familiar activity to make it fresh.



Television referee is an excellent game to play when there's nothing to do, and nothing on TV. Choose a common word, or several common words, to serve as signals for actions for you and your friends. Every time you hear a new signal word on TV, change what you're doing!

Add a new sneaky element to this game by keeping it a secret from adults.
Choose high frequency words, like the name of a character, or difficult actions, like having to do 20 push-ups, to make the game harder.



Heckle a movie with your friends. You probably shouldn't do this in a movie theater and upset other guests, but sitting down with good friends at home to see a hilariously bad movie can lead to a boredom-free time.

Make sure you have popcorn, drinks, and other snacks to have the theater experience.



Game and grindstone is a way you and your friends can make studying less of a drag. Set a timer for 20 minutes, and take turns rotating gaming and studying. At the end of every hour, review what you've learned.

This is also a clever solution if you only have a single controller.



Combine two unrelated games together to come up with something exciting that will help you conquer your doldrums. For example, you might combine the games of freeze tag and rock-paper-scissors, so that a player is only unfrozen after winning against another player in rock-paper-scissors.

, If you're thinking of chess or checkers, both of these can be mentally challenging and a great way to pass the time. But recently there has been an explosion of specialty board games, where you and your friends can exorcise ghosts, repair a gnome-made submarine, or even stop a plague.


A general search for ""interesting board games"" can put you and your friends onto the track of a new and exciting game. Some of these can be expensive, so take advantage of free demonstrations at your local hobby store.

, Or, if you have a different favorite food, try that instead. Baking cookies, banana bread, or brownies can give you the chance to have fun and relax with friends. And you get a treat at the end.


Don't stop having fun when the timer hits zero, make your cupcakes into monsters, using frosting or candy. When you finish your monsters, make heroes, too! Decorate your cookies with patterns, or put several cookies together and frost them in the style of your favorite artist.

, Reflecting on good times can make you feel good in the present, too!By looking back into your past, you and your friends can appreciate how far you've come, and maybe gain a better idea of where you're going.

, With a little effort, you can probably find enough refrigerator boxes to build a more impressive structure than you could when you were younger. Getting your friends involved might upgrade your castle to a palace.


Put on a show involving the new scenery you've just made. Have one of your friends record it with a camera, and then share it with classmates the next day at school.

, A game of cards can be cool and classy or a rowdy good time. Learn new games with your friends and rotate between them so you don't get bored again. Some games to investigate:


Hearts
Spades
Slap Jack
Euchre
Canasta

Say ""yes"" to boredom.,
Acknowledge other activities as a distraction, but do not give in to that temptation.,
Explore the feelings inside your boredom.,
Search for new interests.,
Return control to yourself.",How to Have Fun After a Boring Day at School3," You might think this suggestion ridiculous, especially since you want to have fun. When you feel bored and look to the Internet, television, or music to take your mind off that feeling, it might actually prolong your boredom, or cause it to carry over into activities that might have otherwise been enjoyable.It is generally agreed that some measure of acceptance is required to beat persistent boredom., This is an important time for you to ask yourself if you are really feeling unmotivated, or whether or not something more serious is the root of your boredom.


You might be using boredom as a way of protecting yourself from a big change in your life, feelings of disappointment, a falling out with a friend, or some other concern. Respect your mind's way of protecting itself, but admit to yourself the existence of these deeper feelings., You can do so intuitively, by labeling the impressions you have as they occur to you.


Are you feeling lonely or disconnected? If this is the case, you can help yourself feel better by calling a friend. Are you feeling trapped? Ask a parent or close friend for perspective.
Another common root of boredom is fear. Are you unsure of the future or is a test looming in the not-too-distant future? In these instances, scheduling a meeting with your school counselor or talking with a teacher might help you cure the root of your boredom.

, Though you might want someone to solve this problem for you, research has shown that being involved in finding new hobbies can seriously reduce feelings of boredom.Tests on bored individuals have shown that chronically bored people have lower self-awareness, which has led some to question if boredom is really a lack of understanding what you truly want., A key element involved in boredom is control -- specifically, you not having it.If you're stuck in a waiting room, listening to a lecture, or waiting on a bus, try meditating.


Feeling trapped can make you restless, anxious, and make boredom unbearable. Exert control in the form of meditation to help banish the feeling. Allow your body to relax and your thoughts to focus on physical sensations. Breathe evenly, and allow your mind to focus itself on these simple actions.

Have the Perfect Dress!,
Have Time to Get Ready!,
At the Dance, Bring your camera to take pics of the night with your friends.,
Be yourself!",How to Get Ready for Homecoming," Try to buy your dress at least a couple of weeks ahead of time. If you have dark brown hair, try a red or a navy blue dress (anything that pops). If you have blonde hair, you can wear any darker colored dress to contrast with your hair (black, brown, or even a bright pink). You should know by now what colors look good on you and what doesn't. Do not show people your dress so they can be surprised. and wear undergarments that won't show through your dress.This means that you may have to buy a thong, backless/strapless bra, or you may have to go braless, depending on your dress. For your high heels, make sure you can walk in them. If one inch is all you can walk in, then you rock that short heel (or you could consider fancy sandals or flats). In high school, it is a good idea not to wear anything that reminds you of something you wore in the fifth grade. You want to look mature and classy, not like you shop at Justice and still wear Crocs. Lastly, remember that you are wearing the dress, and the dress should come second to your beauty. Find a dress that compliments your features, instead of swallowing you whole.;
, Give yourself a good 2 hours to get ready (or more, if needed). This is a big part about looking good so don't rush, but watch the time! Put on a face mask. It will make your skin feel great and you will glow. Take a shower and wash your hair, because nothing is more gross than coming to the dance with sweaty hair from soccer practice! After the shower, immediately blow dry your hair or however you know best to style it. By now you have put on a mask (wash it off in shower), taken a shower and styled your hair. Paint nails and toes. Put on perfume and makeup, if you wear it. (There is nothing wrong with going without makeup, and you can look just as beautiful without it!) Make your makeup a little bit more dramatic than your usual daytime makeup, as it is a formal event. Now carefully put on your dress, making sure not to tear anything. Put on shoes right before you leave so your feet don't hurt the first minute you get to the dance.

, Dance with people. Be open to dancing, it can be fun!

, Nothing is more attractive than a self confident, fun-loving gal! Enjoy your special night, because you'll want to do it all over again come morning!

Know the importance of interaction.,
Consider your own style of relating to others.",How to Get Your Friends to Want to Do Things With You," If you are feeling left out, unwanted, or taken for granted by your friendships, it’s time to take a hard look at why that may be. Sitting down to brainstorm or even writing out your feelings can help you identify what exactly is going wrong.


How have your friends been treating you lately? Do they cancel plans at last minute or is it more that you always feel like you have to make the initial invitation in order to see them? Is it a consistent pattern amongst all of your friends?
Do you have a best friend or any especially close relationships? If so, asking for their perspective may be useful as they may see things from the outside that you miss.
Know you’re not alone. Friendship difficulties are something that everyone experiences in their lifetime. Furthermore, a recent study has found that Americans also have fewer close friends than they used to. The researchers believe that other social variables, such as longer work hours, have been contributing to this unfortunate trend.;
, Sometimes simple solutions, such as trying something new together, can reinvigorate a stale friendship. Invite your friends to fun activities and try something new!

, Just make sure that it’s something you’ll enjoy too so that you don’t feel like you’re doing it purely for their benefit.


For example, if one of your friends loves being active, invite them to a new yoga class or propose a bike ride to a place you’ve never been to before.

, You don’t have to go all out and have a massive party, but inviting a few friends you haven’t seen in a while to your home for a nice dinner can let your friends know you truly care about them.


Be sure to make your space comfortable and inviting. Consider having board games, books, or other interesting conversation starters. Having a fun space that creates fond memories for your friends will help you bond and also encourage them to want to spend more time over., Having a two-birds-with-one-stone approach to some activities will incentivize the friend to meet up with you. For example, exercising together or running errands can be a casual way to share an activity and spend some time together., One of the most best ways to make friends want to spend time with you is simply by staying positive.No matter how many interests you share with someone or how long you’ve known them, people inevitably get tired of constant negativity.


Strike a good balance between opening up to friends about the stresses and problems in your life and having a positive outlook. Smile and laugh often as people are attracted to those who make them feel good.
If you aren’t a naturally positive person, try to improve your outlook. Take time to notice and appreciate what you have in life. If you struggle with low self-esteem, be intentional about self-care and learning to accept and love who you are. Self-improvement efforts will eventually translate into being a happier person which will in turn lead to improved relationships.

, Let your friends know that you are grateful for them and their company. You don’t need to make a grand speech about it (in fact, that may be awkward or off putting) but do let them know!


Casual statements such as, “Hey, thanks for taking the time to do this with me, I’m having a great time” or “I really appreciate what a wonderful listener you are” can make your friend feel good and more likely to want to spend time with you again in the future.
Other considerate gestures, such as remembering their birthdays and checking in when they are going through trying times will strengthen your friendship and make them more likely to seek your company in the future.

, Perhaps you’ve outgrown some friends or they’ve outgrown you. Either way, if you feel like it’s a constant, draining battle to get your friends to hang out with you, forming some new social groups may be necessary.


Through forming a few close friendships or becoming part of a new community, you should find some people who are not only willing but actively want to spend time with you.

, Try going out to places that are likely to attract people with similar interests. This may seem obvious, but we tend to form stronger friendships with those who are similar to us.


Therefore, if you love to read, join a book club. If you love animals, try volunteering at an animal shelter. Any activity that brings you in contact with people who are likely to have common interests will heighten your chances of meeting a new friend.

, When meeting new people, show them that you are comfortable by looking them in the eye and maintain a relaxed but confident posture by holding your back straight and dropping your shoulders. Body language communicates a great deal and you’re more likely to make friends with people who feel comfortable around you.

, During conversations, be sure to ask follow up questions, which will not only let people know you genuinely want to get to know them but also help you find common ground which will get you beyond the small talk and into the conversations that really create a bond.


If you are finding it hard to carry on a conversation, try dropping a small (but sincere) compliment, asking them about their day, or their opinion on a recent news event.

, Parties and other social gatherings are great for meeting people but really getting to know a person takes time and extended conversation. That person you met who is also obsessed with cats? Ask them if they’d like to get tea or coffee with you sometime.


Don’t be afraid to put yourself out there, especially if you’ve already established common ground with someone. If that person turns you down, don’t take it personally and just move on as you are bound to meet others who actively reciprocate a desire to get to know you better.

, When invited to social events, say yes as much as possible. Whenever you make an effort, people will take notice and appreciate that you follow through on invitations.The more social gatherings you attend, the stronger your bonds will be with those who invited you. And, of course, you have the added benefit of meeting even more potential friends!

, There are some friends who, no matter what you do, simply don’t seem interested in spending time with you or reciprocating any efforts you make for them. It can be difficult to know exactly when and how to end a friendship but it’s something we must all do at some point or another.


Tune into your emotions and ask yourself how this person makes you feel. Do you feel they listen to and genuinely care about you? Do you feel exhausted by their energy or do you just get the sense that the friendship is inauthentic? Be honest with yourself when examining the relationship. If this person intentionally excludes you from events or manipulates you, then those are clear signs to get out.
Toxic friendships tend to be unsupportive, draining, stifling, and unequal.If you are constantly initiating activities with a friend and receive nothing in return, that is a definite red flag of a toxic friend.
If this “friend” already gives you the silent treatment, it may not be necessary to even let them know you are cutting off the relationship. However, if they begin to pester you, it’s important to be direct about your intention to end the friendship.
If you do decide to let them know directly that you are ending the friendship, make it clear that it is because of how you feel and emphasize that you are making the decision for your own health and happiness. Do not blame them or imply that there is something wrong with them as a person.After all, you’re not trying to make enemies, you just want better friends.
If you cannot avoid seeing this person (such as being coworkers or in the same class), limit the amount of time you spend around them and set clear boundaries. Don’t be cold or cruel towards them, just make it clear that you no longer want to give your time and energy to an unhealthy and draining friendship.

, Understanding the basics behind friendship dynamics will help you become a better friend and analyze your own friends’ behaviors.


Friendships can form in a variety of places, from your workplace or school to chance encounters and the Internet. However, regardless of how you meet a person, a true friendship is only formed through emotional and mental connections.There are many factors that go into the formation of a friendship. Some of these factors include similarity (having shared interests, preferences, style, etc), fascination (being genuinely interested in getting to know each other), spending time together (to build collective experiences and memories that draw each other closer), and loyalty (being there for each other through thick and thin)., Though you may not hear these terms in everyday conversations, they are two crucial variables to friendship formation. We often do both instinctively, but being conscious about practicing both can help you form stronger friendships in the long run.


Self-disclosure essentially means being vulnerable and disclosing things about yourself that you wouldn’t want the whole world to know. Opening up to another person signals that you trust them and want them to better understand you. Sharing personal details or problems to each other creates a new intimacy out of which a friendship is formed.However, this process doesn’t occur unless both people open up to each other, therefore it’s necessary for both people to reciprocate in order to be friends.

, Though studies have shown that face to face interaction is still the number one way to form and maintain relationships, there are many methods today to maintain correspondence.


Facebook, email, Skype, and other methods of communication all help to maintain connections--the important thing to is to stay in touch.Everyone has different styles of communication, so understanding your friends’ individual methods will help you interact with them in their preferred way. You can even directly ask your friends, as some people have anxiety about social media interaction and prefer to meet face to face while others are the exact opposite.

, Once you have understood the basic psychology behind friendships, try relating what you have learned to your own behaviors. Taking some time to ask yourself the following questions can help identify ways in which you can improve as a friend.


Are you more of a giver or a taker? All relationships require both giving and receiving so try to identify if you tend to lean more in one direction or another.
Are you a good communicator? What types of interaction do you perform best in? Communicating effectively is key to any good relationship so think about whether you are better able to open up in person, over the phone, and whether you disclose enough about yourself and listen to others when they do the same to you.

Remember that this situation is temporary.,
Find things to do.,
Choose some activities that guarantee you'll come into contact with other people.,
Be friendly.,
Travel: If you find yourself visiting other places, remember that traveling involves meeting new people, so be open to find and enjoy whatever piques your interest; you just might end up with a pen pal.,
Go online.,
Hang out with your siblings.,
Don't be ashamed.",How to Get Past Not Having Friends," All things pass, and so too does the state of not having friends. Whatever the reasons are for not having them right now, you can tell yourself that this is only a temporary hitch in your life. It is probable that this is a time in your life where you need to have some time alone to realize what you're capable of; to realize what it means to have a true friend, in place of people who simply come and go in your life.


Keep your feelings in a journal. Writing them out can help you to work out what is causing you to feel sad or afraid about the lack of friends in your life and will also help you with clues about what to do to improve your situation. Letting the thoughts continue to swirl around your head unformed can be unhelpful and confusing––writing will help you to sort it all through.;
, It is important to focus on doing something that can keep you happy and energized in spite of the lack of friendships. This might be a hobby, volunteering, studying or learning new knowledge, learning a new language, taking up computer programming for fun, gardening, cooking or baking, playing guitar, and so on. Choose pastimes and interests that you can really get involved in.

, If you don't have friends, you won't find them at home. Getting out and about is essential to finding new friends and people with similar interests to yours. Take up a sport, hobby, night class or join a club, group or volunteer organization where you can meet other people. It can be helpful to choose some activities that don't involve the same people you see each day at school, work, etc., as this will broaden the people you come into contact with, thereby increasing your chances of finding people with whom you really click.

, No matter where you are or what you're doing, be friendly to others at all times. Be civil. Always have a smile at the ready, be ready to nod as you pass by people and greet people when you see them. If you don't feel up to conversing with others, at least say hello and ask how people are. Simply being polite and friendly will cause people to be attracted to you.


You may be very shy. Use your smile as a shield, to suggest that you're approachable even though you're shy. You don't have to say a lot to people; just show interest in them. ""Hi, I'm Mary, what's your name?"" is an easy way to start a conversation.
Complimenting people on their clothing or hairstyle (but only if you mean it) is also a great way to show people that you're interested in talking to them.

, As long as you are friendly and polite, being a tourist isn't so different from who you are at ""home"". Just be yourself. If you do meet someone who is innately friendly with you, don't be afraid to ask people for email contact addresses and Skype names so that you can stay in touch long distance.

, Make friends in cyberspace. If you're able to connect with people who have the same interests and sense of humor as you, this can be a fantastic way to make friends. You may even get to meet up some day.

, Yes, sometimes they can be annoying, but put any differences and fights behind you because you have to put up with your family until the day you die. It's easier and better to be friends than fighting siblings.

, Don't see this as a big issue, friendships cannot be forced and if another person decides they don't want to be your friend, that's their choice and is not a reflection on your self-worth. As time goes on, you'll realize that having a few very solid good friends is always worth a great deal more than lots of shallow ones who drop you the instant you cease to serve their purposes. Be strong and look for the people who really matter; indeed, bad situations are often the best test of who will really stand by you, so always look for such people.

This will help you know what kind of clothes to wear as well if you may need additional items, such as an umbrella or sunscreen.


For warm weather, consider a sundress with cute sandals. You could also opt for a pair of shorts and a nice top; a shirt with a little sparkle or shine would dress up your shorts well.
For colder weather, you could choose a nice pair of jeans or dress pants. Adding a printed blouse and a nice jacket, such as a pea coat, would take your look from everyday to dressed up.;
, If you’re uncomfortable due to the weather or temperature, you won’t enjoy yourself. Whether it's layered tank tops, a blouse over a long sleeved tee, or leggings under a short dress, layers always work. Bring a wrap or jacket in case you get chilly., An active date requires clothing you can move around in. If you’re planning to go mini-golfing, choose a comfortable shoe rather than a high heel. If you’re going to a fancy restaurant consider a dress or pants with a nice blouse, rather than ripped jeans and sneakers.For an active date, consider nice shorts, capris, or pants; a skirt or dress may make it more difficult for you to move around in. Pair your bottoms with a fun top; an off-the-shoulder blouse or a patterned tank top would work well.
For a date at the movies, a restaurant, etc. you could choose a skirt or dress. Consider pairing your skirt with a sparkly tee or ruffled blouse. Adding a fun jacket or shrug over your dress is also a nice idea. A romper would also work well for this type of date.

, Don’t wait until the last minute to choose your outfit. Think about what you might wear a few days before the date. You can even lay out your options and consider what you will feel the best in. That way, when the time comes, you’ll be comfortable and confident.


You could lay out several types of outfits: a maxi dress with a bold belt and sandals; fitted jeans with a ruched top and boots; capris and a wrap top with heels; a skirt paired with a graphic tee and flats; or a sundress with a jacket and wedges.

, If you are constantly pulling up your top or tugging down your skirt, you won’t be comfortable. Choose an outfit that fits well, meaning there are no bulging seams, puckering necklines, or uneven hems. As a general rule, if you wear a tight skirt or pants, pair them with a loose-fitting top. If you choose a tight top, pair it with looser pants to balance your look., To determine your skin tone, look at the veins on the underside of your wrist. If they appear blue or purple, you have a cool skin tone and will look best in colors such as blue, lavender, rose, or gray. If they appear green, you have a warm skin tone, and will look best in honey, coral, olive, and cream. If it’s hard to tell one way or the other, you have a neutral skin tone, and will look best in jade, red, or white.A neutral top could be paired with colorful or printed bottoms, or neutral bottoms with a bold or patterned top.

, Don’t try to look like a thirty-something going out for cocktails. Wear clothes that are age-appropriate; nothing too tight or revealing. Consider classic styles, such as A-line dresses, fitted pants, and flowing tops., Choose an outfit that makes you feel comfortable and that you consider awesome. Your date wants to spend time with you, not with you pretending to be someone you aren’t. Think about how you looked when you two made the date; start there and dress it up a bit.If you normally wear jeans and tees, don’t opt for an evening gown unless the occasion calls for it (such as a black-tie affair).
If your style is usually bohemian, for example, your date may be disappointed to see you in a preppy outfit.

, A smile is the best accessory there is. It tells your date that you’re ready to have fun and enjoy each other’s company. Keep a positive attitude. This will also help you seem more confident, even if you feel nervous., A pair of shoes can change the way an outfit looks. Dress your outfit up with a pair of heels or boots, or dress it down with flats or sandals. Remember to keep in mind what you’ll be doing on the date and pick shoes appropriate for the occasion.There are tons of options out there: wedges, stilettos, booties, kitten heels, pumps, slingbacks, platforms, peep-toes, and mules, or ballet flats, sneakers, flat boots, moccasins, oxfords, etc.

, Don’t go overboard here, two or three accessories are enough. A fun necklace or a couple bangle bracelets can give an old outfit a whole new feel. A scarf can add a pop of color to a neutral outfit, and a cute headband will really jazz up your look.Fashion designer Coco Chanel advises women to look in the mirror before leaving the house and to remove one accessory.

, Remember that less is more here! One, or at the most, two, spritzes of perfume will do. Too much perfume is off-putting. One spray, a few inches over your head, will give you a nice, mellow scent. If you want to add more, opt for a light spritz on the insides of your elbows., You’ll likely have a few items you’ll want to bring; keys, phone, cash, etc. Choose a clutch if you’ll have somewhere to set your bag, or a purse with straps if you won’t. Don’t worry about matching the bag to your outfit; you can coordinate them or choose a bag that contrasts."

Think about what is at stake.,
Consider how important your presence is to others.,
Reflect on the kind of interactions you have.,
Look at your financial situation.",How to Decide Whether to Go Out or Stay In1," In some social events, it's a bad idea to skip out. An event for work or school, for example, could help you make connections. If your career or relationships will colleagues depend on an event, you should make an effort to attend.For example, look at events like a boss's birthday party or a mixer with members of your graduate program. These events allow you to make connections and keep up good relationships at work and school. It's probably a bad idea to miss such events.
However, other events are low-key. If your friends are having a bowling night, for example, it won't hurt your career to skip out.;
, Consider the feelings of other people involved. Is anyone counting on you to go? Did you make a strong commitment to an event? How disappointed will people be if you don't show up?For example, your friend may be hurt if you skip their birthday party. Friends may also be hurt if you made a strong commitment to something. If you and your friends have been planning a camping trip for months, for example, it may be a bad idea to skip it at the last minute.
Social events that are less important can usually be avoided without too much trouble. For example, if your friends have a movie night every week it's unlikely anyone will feel too bad if you stay at home one day.

, People tend to be happier when they have meaningful interactions with others over small talk. An event may be more worth your while if you're going to have interactions that matter there.If you're very close to some of the people attending, you're more likely to have meaningful interactions that will help you feel refreshed upon leaving.
However, if it's mostly strangers and acquaintances, you may not have as much fun.

, Be honest about whether you can afford to go out. Think about how much money you'll be spending and consider other expenses you have for the month or week. If your budget is looking tight, stay in the for the night and save some money.If you want to go out even though money is tight, try limiting how much you spend. Bring cash instead of relying on a debit card and only spend as much cash as you have on you.

And when it's night and dark beyond the perimeter of the fire, and maybe cold too, coming together as a group around fire tends to bring out primal feelings of togetherness and coziness. There is also a sense of wonderment that a nighttime campfire can induce in participants, as the sky opens up before all. A campfire event is a great occasion for rounding off a conference or seminar, especially one of several days' duration. It's also a great way to build team spirit for a work, school, or academic group, to excite a group of usually disinterested teens, or to celebrate a special event such as a person's birthday or an anniversary. And for those guiding or leading hiking, backpacking, outdoor sport, and other outdoor recreation groups, the social campfire is a great way to end each day and bring everyone together. Be guided by the opportunity a campfire event presents to create bonding, excitement, and possible learning experiences.;
, Wherever you have the campfire, it needs to be legal, safe, accessible, and not be something that will annoy people not participating in it. Depending on the location, amenities such as toilets might be helpful but this might not be essential. If the campfire is near buildings, bush, or anything else flammable, it's also important to have contingency plans in place for putting out the fire should anything go wrong.


Call your local municipality or council to check the legality of your campfire event. You might need a permit, and it might not just be about the fire but also about holding a gathering. If it's on private property, still check the legality of holding a fire at the time of year you plan on having it; the last thing you want is to be cause of a wildfire.

, A campfire can be held all day long (such as at a music festival) or it can be reserved for the evening and night. The fire is at its best when it's dark, so planning for some nighttime aspect of your event is a good idea.

, Send out invitations as appropriate (by email, by mail, by poster, announcement at a meeting, etc.). If you are taking money for attendance, organize this in advance. It is also important to advise those coming what they need to bring, such as warm clothing, cushions, a flashlight (torch) or lamp, sturdy shoes, rain-jacket, tickets, etc.


If you are arranging transport, also advise guests where they need to meet and by what time in order to be collected and taken to the campfire. If you have a large group, consider using smaller buses or vans as a shuttle service rather than one inflexible bus that only leaves once each way.

, Having in place a rough plan is important, or more appropriately, a guide. You need to have a sense of what you want to achieve from the campfire get-together rather than just expecting everyone to work that out for themselves. While some of the time should be free for socializing individually or in small groups, it's a good idea to plan activities, announcements, and food for everyone to participate in.


Have a song list prepared, along with a time line of activities so that things aren't simply happening randomly. It helps to be able to refer to this guide as the night proceeds. Avoid sharing this time line with the participants though, as it's best to keep surprising them and to be flexible.
The guide used for the evening needs to be flexible, in order to adjust the program as needed. For example, if the campfire attendees seem to be getting restless and bored, be ready with an action song. Or, if they're getting too rowdy have some slow songs or a skit to insert to quieten things down.

, A good campfire is neither too long nor too short. So what is a good timing? A good timing is one that builds up the participants and ends before their energy level starts to go down too much. This usually happens between 60 to 90 minutes.


The diagram shows how a campfire builds up. Notice that it does not end back right at the bottom.

, The MC needs to have a good feel for the occasion and what the participants are likely to want to get out of it. The MCs are critical to maintaining the mood of the campfire. Besides being energetic and extroverted, MCs also need to be able to conduct the campfire as it is ongoing, they need to be able to control the mood according to what is required and therefore need to be able to feel the participants and react accordingly. MCs need to know the lyrics of songs sung and be able to sing them at the correct pace and tempo.

, There are numerous things you can do for a campfire event, all of them dependent on who is coming, the purpose of your event, and how much equipment or other resources you have available. Some of the suggestions include:



Singing. Songs should be clustered together, according to a theme. That theme might be fast songs, slow songs, or songs based around a particular topic that is relevant to the group. Instead of just singing anything, singing songs that have a similar pace would be good. For example, singing ""A thousand legged worm"" just after ""Pearly shells"" doesn't quite match. Fast songs and slow songs should be put in separate clusters. Alternatively, songs can be clustered together by type; for example, action songs in one cluster or foreign language songs in a cluster. Be sure to provide song sheets for the participants to follow.

Stargazing. Provided the sky complies, this can be a lovely way to spend time with the group by the firelight. Have someone knowledgeable about the constellations lead the group in discovering the stars above.
Food. Campfire cooking can be encouraged by the provision of ingredients for s'mores, toast, toasted marshmallows, foil-wrapped foods, bannock on a stick, spider dogs, chili, stew, apple crisp, etc. Look through a campfire cookbook and decide which recipes will work for your event and provide the ingredients and cooking equipment. Have someone act as head chef with instructions and help for those bewildered by what to do, and it's also a good idea to have plenty of ready-made food available for the people who don't want to toast their treats in the campfire.

Conversations. Encourage people to mingle and talk to one another by giving breaks between entertainment and by provision of food which requires people to sit together to eat. Lower the music to encourage talking.
Reading poetry, stories, plays, etc. This could include a short performance that makes the most of the dark atmosphere around the fire site. And ghost stories are another possibility if anyone's in the mood!

Drum Circle. Bring drums and rhythms instruments of any sort and get going with a simple steady beat. Fire and drums have been a natural pair for thousands of years.
Deep and meaningful discussions. This can be a great opportunity to hold a deep discussion about spiritual, faith, hope, or other issues that move you as a group. Especially useful for a spiritual retreat, an activists' pow-wow, or a church/faith group.
Particular activities related to your group's interests.

, If you've had a long week, you may be feeling tired. If you're already exhausted, you may not last long at an outing. If you're just going to end up turning in early, going out may not be worth it.

,, Some songs may have beautiful melodies or nice choruses, but when you examine the lyrics, you may find they are inappropriate for a wedding. Many love songs are about break-ups or unrequited love.

, For example, if you choose an ""Old Hollywood Glamour"" theme for your wedding, a jazz standard would be appropriate, but 1 of your indie rock favorites may not fit the mood.

, It is important to some couples to have songs that make their guests want to get out of their seats. If most of your guests are younger friends, a more modern choice may be a crowd pleaser, but if the majority of the guests are elderly relatives, you may get a better response to a swing dance or traditional choice.

, Most wedding planners suggest you search for songs that are about 3 minutes long, or that you edit the song you choose to fit that timeframe.


Choose a song whose duration matches your plans for the first dance. Some couples dance to the first dance song by themselves, while others also incorporate the father/daughter and mother/son dances into the first dance. If you need to choreograph multiple spots for cutting in, a longer song may better suit your needs.

, Whether you choose to waltz, foxtrot, rumba, or just slow dance, the pace of the dance type you choose will dictate the tempo of your first dance song.


Listen to the tempo of your favorite first dance songs.
Cross any songs of the list that will not work with your chosen dance style.
Practice dancing to the remaining songs. Make sure that you are comfortable performing your chosen dance to any top contenders.

, If you are taking a dance class with your partner in preparation for the wedding, your teacher may have many ideas for first dance songs. The teacher will also be able to provide a personal recommendation that matches your dance style as a couple.

, If you have hired a live band and will not be using recorded music, it's important to verify the band can perform your top choices.


Ask the band to play 2 to 5 of your favorite first dance songs.
Evaluate which songs the band plays best. If you thought you wanted to use an Aerosmith song for your first dance, your jazz band's rendition may make you change your mind.

, Make sure she will have adequate mobility before you choose a dance style and song that will require fancy footwork. A mermaid or sheath gown may restrict her movements and make a dance like the waltz impossible, and the weight of a princess style gown with a long, bustled train can make more energetic dances like swing difficult.

Change any wet bedwash that should be on the bed from an accident that night.",How to Host a Sleepover when You Know That You Wet the Bed," Although most sleepovers are with only one other person, if you'd like, you can plan a small party where a group of friends gather and sleep in the same room. Whether the invitees know your secret or not, it'll be pertinent to know who you are inviting over to the sleepover that night.
, The answer of this must come from deep down inside you. Try to determine your friendship with the invitee and if you would want them to know that you have been having bedwetting accidents. Determine if you can trust them with the fact that they won't let out any of your bedwetting secret to others. A true friend will understand and accept the fact that you wet the bed and that you aren't wetting the bed maliciously.


Bedwetting affects all sorts of people in many different ways. Much like how some people can't see without glasses and some people can't get around without a wheelchair, the bedwetter's body just can't control the urge to urinate when they fall asleep without letting them know that their bladder is full and they need to urinate into the toilet.

, Although current invitations have turned towards digital invitations, you can still handwrite a letter and send or call the person and expect a response after a period of a few days. Mention that you are having a sleepover on a certain night from and to two dated times but try not to mention in the letter that you bed-wet unless you can rest assured that your invitees know your secret and won't divulge your secret on others or from shying away from attending the sleepover.


Date your page containing your invitation accordingly. This can give them the reassurance that they are reading a current invite and not some invite from a party they have already attended but forgot to discard.
Tell your guests that it is a sleepover and they are invited.
Give them the dates and times of drop-off and pick-up, if they choose to attend. Set aside a date and a time when the sleepover will begin and plan in advance. Write this date down in the invitation.






Mention the address the sleepover is being held at. This is critical.






Give your intended guests an RSVP date in the invitation slip, if they plan to attend. Try to get them to give you a yes or no answer within a two week period prior to the sleepover.
Mention which door you'd like your guests to arrive at, if you have to use an alternate door to enter and exit from besides your front door.

, Realize that your friends will need to realize that nothing different changes between you and your guests no matter if you have to wear bedwetting diapers or not.


Assure your guests (if you have siblings) that your siblings won't be permitted to enter your room once you and your guests have settled down for the night and that your siblings will be watched over by your parents so that your guests won't be bothered by their presence(as long as you can efficiently trust your parents to watch over your siblings while you and your guests are asleep or are getting ready to sleep).

,

Try to give your guests the power to choose whether they will want to sleep on your-provided beds or if they should choose to bring their own beds (such as air mattresses or sleeping bags and the like). If you don't have enough beds for each of your guests, mention to them that there isn't enough beds to go around that that each of these guests bring their own sleeping accommodations. Always try to utilize any empty beds first.

, Prepare a setup plan of how the sleepover will be set up. If you have to sleep in bunk beds, recognize that bunk beds tend to have problems during sleepovers when the hosting family's child bed-wets. Sleeping in the bottom bunk may have some problems with additional leakage, but isn't always the best solution for the problem for the sleepover night.


If you must sleep on bunk beds, the invitee must sleep on the top bunk to ensure that any of the host's bedwetting accidents don't dribble down onto the invitee during that night, as well as so that the invitee doesn't notice that the bedwetter hasn't gotten up to grab a new protective garment (as you'll later learn about in this article) after the accident.

Use common courtesy though if your friend says they have problems with sleeping in the same room or in the top bunk of a bunk bed and can find another suitable place to sleep in your house that's fair to them, their parents, you and your parents.



, Choose some protective bedwetting diapers, along with some disposable bedwetting bed mats and even using a waterproof mattress protector. Become so comfortable with sleeping with these on, you'll want to use these even on the days the sleepover isn't even being used., Changing from your day-clothes into your nightwear and clean bedwetting diaper is crucial to the preparation that must go on during the sleepover night.


Make the transition a part of your standard routine and have your parents help you choose one that best fits you. Make the transition between wearing one at night seem as seemless as possible to ensure you are ready for the transition on the sleepover night.
Yes, there are some emotional triggers that will make you feel like saying ""Yuck!"" But, protection must be achieved, to ensure the sleepover is a success. It'll be quite a big transition between not having to wear (as you did before the decision was made) and now with the diaper being an integral part of the procedure, but if you don't wear one, you'll wish you had because the sleepover won't be a success if an accident occurs and you weren't wearing one.
Utilize your diapers any time you end up taking any siesta. If you still take siestas (naps) in the afternoon or evening hours, choose to wear these diapers.

, Pre-planning for this transition like this for a sleepover is key when the host kid wets their bed., If you explain to your parents that you don't completely understand the process of changing it, they'll be able to show you. However, if they don't, wikiHow has an article on those steps too.


Make sure that you are aware of this process to ensure you don't have to have a whole-house uproar if and when the accident occurs during the sleepover. If they showed you the process to have prepared you for your own diaper-changes, make sure to brush up on this action at least once the night before the sleepover so it is solidly engrained in your mind.

, Use these mats as secondary and tertiary forms of protection on the bed to ensure the bed can't become wet from your bedwetting accident.


Use a alternative waterproof fitted-style mattress protector as you sleep on the bed each night. Although these can sometimes be called waterproof mattress covers, these can help salvage even more of the bed's fine fibers from becoming ruined due in part to the wetting accident.. However, ToysRUs sells these offline for twin-sized beds. Mattress protectors don't go overtop of the fitted sheet on the bed, but can help the accident from travelling through to the mattress below.

, Try to nix all frilly pieces of lingerie when you go to bed, as the frilly clothing will make for a much tighter fit and with diapers, you want to feel a bit loose on your stomach-line. Use sets of nightwear that include night shirts and night pants until you no longer need to wear the diapers to bed: these can include sweatpants and casual nightwear, but you'll have to buy the more comfortable pieces.The bigger the clothing, the better possibility the protective clothing will not be seen or noticed easily.

If you own an adult blanket sleeper, you may choose to wear it, though you may want to think twice in terms of the current weather conditions since these sleepers are always a bit baggy in the genital areas where the diaper will be utilized.

, Have a trash bag and lidded garbage can around to help you dispose of each wet garment you end up claiming after you spot each wet garment. Most disposable garments can be thrown away quite easily into this trash disposal area lined with the bag.

, It's not your fault for wetting the bed. Even at age eleven, twelve and thirteen, lots of kids still wet their bed, so you are not doing this alone.

, While most kids tend to keep the bedwetting diaper packages visible (so they aren't forgotten once the nighttime routine begins), some kids may need a parental reminder to change into them, so as to ensure you don't forget. Have your parents make sure to remind you such as ""Don't forget to change into those diapers that were just bought and placed in your room"" every night, or they may help you change into them upon dressing for bedtime.


Although it's a matter of choice where you keep these pieces, most bedwetters prefer to keep their diaper packages open at one end of their dresser to ensure they don't forget to change into their diapers before they begin the sleeping process each and every night preceding the sleepover.

, Make sure that these packages have diapers in them (should you need to change them by yourself at night) and that there are more available if the need drags even further than the first couple (such as if a case of the flu or other stomach bug begins).

Keep a few (two or three) spare diapers in a stack in an ""emergencies only"" location and recharge this stack during the day following the necessary need to use.
If your parents help you make your bed or help you dress, have them do a daily sweeping check of all your diaper stack piles to ensure that you are stacked with some extra diapers that you can use if you need them during the night. Although most will check into your stack before they turn off the light, they should keep an eye on how many are there at least once per day. and may have to come back to help you replenish (if they notice you are out or coming close to running out). If you can change your clothes by yourself, monitor your stacks very closely, and remind them when it's time to replenish and before you run out and end up reaching into your emergency stash of diapers.
Even if you didn't have an accident in the preceding night's diaper, use a fresh one from out of the package. Sweat can build up inside the bedwetting diaper's parts and can end up sticking back to your diaper's genital region of your skin.

, Sometimes, if the messes aren't too bad, most bedwetters don't even change their diaper and rely on only releasing urine into their diaper alone during the sleepover. However, some parents do think differently, in hopes that you'll take their advice (since wet garments tends to accumulate rashes in affected areas). This decision must be left to the wearer and their parents to decide how they'd like to let this evolve at the sleepover.

, Put them into less visible areas up and out of the way of passersby. Bring out several diapers from the package and set them down in a less visible place, such as in a partially-empty drawer (such as space near your underwear in your dresser) away from prying eyes of your invitees. Arrange your diapers with what can be agreed upon with your parents permission. If you need them during the night, you'll still need to know where to find them, but your parents will want some control so they know where to look prior to the sleepover and/or if they are needed in an emergency.


Never change the orientation the diapers as you work through the pack. If the diapers were standing with the front facing you, make sure that the diapers can sit tight with the outer edge facing outward. (Never reverse the direction.) You've started a regimen before, and changing it now would be completely useless and forgotten where and how to grab it.

If you kept the center core facing you, make sure to make sure the core is facing you during the sleepover night. If the diaper was in a pile, keep them in a pile.



, Empty out and dispose of the dirty pairs of bedwetting diapers you have previously used, so as not to show your medical secrets to your invitees once they arrive. If there are many that are inside your drawers or are in another trash can, you may need to use a trash bag to bag these diapers up.

Bedwetting diapers are different than just standard styled disposable diapers meant for babies. Diaper Genie machines can't handle bedwetting diapers; so don't try to fit them inside of them.

, On the morning you awake from your sleepover, you'll need something to change into to make it seem as if you had no accident and that no sweat has built up during the night. You'll want to plan on using the diaper until your invitee leaves, so keeping one handy is of utmost concern. (You'll learn where the dirty one goes momentarily.), Make sure to change the bedmat and replace the mattress protector (if you have more than one) onto the bed you are using. This must be done at least an hour before the sleepover begins; even if it's not wet, change it! Dispose of the old bed mat into the trash bag containing the previously-used diapers, and place a new one on the bed in it's place. Make the transition to that sleepover night seem seamless.

, Give yourself some space in time, so you are not scrambling at the last second and accidentally tear or urinate into the diaper (causing a mishap to happen at the very last second). Even if the sleepover doesn't start until later in the evening, you'll want as little contact with your invitees as possible when showing your guests that you must wear a diaper to bed and having an embarrassment happen when they arrive and are walked through your door.


If your invitees normally arrive at other parties unexpectedly early, plan on changing at least one hour before the sleepover is supposed to begin but shortly after you have changed your own bedwash. If your invitee arrives unexpectedly early and you don't have time to change into the diaper , secretly grab a diaper and change yourself into your diaper in your own bathroom - all in hopes of not seeming odd, strange or even remotely different than your invitee.

, Utilize your bathroom until the sleeping portion of the sleepover begins. You're guests will smell the stench of the urine when they come through the door if you utilize your diaper, and they can spot when things are amiss and your genital region sags more than normal. Add in a few extra minutes to make the adjustment when going into the bathroom to pull up your pants., However, keep this information you mention to a bare minimum. If they are a true friend, you can tell them your deep dark secret during any evening activities without stirring up trouble or causing an embarrassing situation to arise.


Don't worry: Some bedwetting diapers (such as Pampers UnderJams and most store-brand bedwetting diapers (if available)) have the association of being more spotted than those associated to Goodnites (by Huggies). With a little more disguise and planning, you can achieve a great result in the end.
Realize that with underwear may be worn with bedwetting diapers if you plan accordingly. Bedwetting diapers tend to be thicker than than a normal pair of underwear, so plan to wear at least one size larger underwear to ensure the diaper doesn't become lodged in the diaper when you go to move around when you have an accident in them.

You can go around without a pair of underwear on top of the diapers wearing a pair of pants and shirt instead, but beware that you must be able to conceal your diapers until all of your guests know about your bedwetting issue or until your guests leave the next morning, all to ensure you don't expose your medical secret too early.



, Most sleepovers begin with a cheery connection between you and the invitee(s), but how you greet them is up to you. However, most host families with a bedwetter traditionally neglect to make much mention of your use of bedwetting diapers for your bedwetting problem.


If your friends are your true friends of yours, you may want to tell or hint to them that you have to wear the diaper. They might want to know and you should really hint that you need to wear them. Tell them that you have wetting accidents in your bed, and that these diapers help prevent your sleeping accommodations from becoming wet but they shouldn't be alarmed - all without using the proper term ""diaper"" in your description of the preventative item.
Don't reveal that you wet your bed if your invitees don't trust that you'll know how to handle accidents when they occur, since this will almost always backfire on your plan to handle an accident when they occur.
Mention to those who choose to accidentally reveal that they too have bedwetting problems, that you side with them and must wear diapers for your bedwetting problem too. But pick your battles wisely, if you think this secret might backfire on your plan.

If you suspect or have noticed your guests also wearing a bedwetting diaper, you're in luck. If you can, share your diaper stack with them. They will later thank you for telling them and make adequate plans to keep your diaper stack freshly stocked for both you and your invitees to share during that sleepover night.


Don't make the greeting be any more dramatic other than saying hello and walking them in. However, don't make it seem as if you were awaiting their arrival while sitting next to the door when you provide the greeting.







, Even if you realize that you can still hold your urine in during the day, having to change into the diaper when the friend is at your house can become chaotic and problematic for most.

Don't feel ashamed if your sleepover guest must find out that you wet your bed and have to wear these diapers. It's a natural problem that kids must know exists, and eventually they will want to know why you have to keep concealing your ""secret"" from them. That issue must be only up to the wearer and the wearer's parents to decide.

, If you have to take medications to help manage frequent bedwetting, by all means take that medication! Don't skip your medications on the night of the sleepover. You may have to take your medications in an alternate place if you are afraid your guests will accidentally find out, but that's a small price to pay in part with dealing with life while stuck in a phase that makes you urinate while you sleep without waking you up., Utilize the system of diaper-wearing as you have during those last few weeks.It all comes down to handling your bedwetting, much like you've been handling it with the same processes from the past few weeks.

, The diaper and bed mat may protect your body and bed a bit, but no piece of clothing is foolproof - no matter how disposable it is believed or claimed to be. Things happen that can make accidents seem very disastrous during sleepover nights. Change only the wet diaper after the accident during the night, but don't make a big fuss; don't talk or allow the furniture or your diapers to creek around as you walk., You'll get your chance to change your diaper into your day clothes in a little while, but for now you'll have to live with wearing this diaper and nightclothes until your invitees leave for their homes the next morning.


Look into changing your diapers in your bathroom, if you have time before your invitees awaken. However, if your invitees have arisen out of bed before or with you, you'll need to delay your diaper and clothing change after the guest departs.

, To ensure the natural transition at a sleepover, let the morning routine flow. Whether that means allowing to serve them breakfast or allowing them to arise from their slumbers at their will on their casual planning, this sleepover can be an easy solution.

As was stated earlier when talking about placing an extra diaper in the bathroom, use the period after you have awakened and before the guests wake up to change your diapers. Place all used diapers in a small plastic bag that can be tied shut and knotted and placed separately into any trash can in your home - however, most bedwetters will use their bathroom trash can for convenience purposes.

, Walk your friend to the door when you hear the doorbell ring for your guests parent's arrival. Thank your friend for coming, and let them walk to their ride for pick-up.

,, If you are intending to have other sleepovers at your house soon thereafter, plan on continuing to use the diaper regimen and keep up the process so as not to forget and get out of your routine.

, Prepare the bed with a new disposable bed mat, once the bedwash has been changed.

For these occasions, you should have a list of back ups that will bring the mood up again. The activities should be fun and not very competitive like hide and seek or just chilling and watching a movie. However if you are going to be playing team games make sure you don't put people who are arguing on the same team.

It just makes it a lot easier to choose: food, drinks, activities, themes and lots more., Themes can be fun and make your party that tiny bit of extra fun but they can also limit your choices. If you are going to choose a theme then make sure that it suits everyone.

",How to Host a Sleepover (Teen Girls)," Also, don't invite someone if they cause drama. At a sleepover you don't want to have a person who is always bragging and causing situations especially if it's a good friend.;
, That way, you don't need to be embarrassed by how untidy your house is. Clean houses make a better environment for sleepovers, and will make your guests more comfortable. Get your house ready for your guests. Make sure the bathrooms are clean, as your guest will be using them. You can ask your parents or siblings to help you out with this step.If you want maybe list the names of rooms the guests have to stay out of (Ex. Parents room, Sibling Room, Basement).Prepare your room for the sleepover too.

, Make sure you have everything you need for activities. Recommended items include nail polish, makeup, an iPod, a TV with a DVD player, teenage movies, and phone chargers. Be sure to have lots of food and drinks that fit into your meal plans for dinner and breakfast. Also note any allergies or diets your guests may have,some foods may also be against their religious beliefs.

, If your slumber party is themed, consider decorating the space you'll be sleeping in. It's always fun when decorated. Make sure to play music teens like, or your friends. Most are in the new music. Make sure the music is appropriate if your parents won't allow certain songs.


Cover the windows with black butcher paper. Hang twinkling light strands all around the party area. Scatter inflated balloons that are your favorite colors all over the floor. Its also good when its dark because that means party time!
If available, color changing LED lights would also make for a good mood in the room. Use playful colors such as blue, green, and pink. Dancing water speakers also can create this effect and will keep the party exciting.

Make them feel welcome, and offer her/them a drink. Find something she can do until the other guests arrive. Most girls talk with guests that are already there. Wait until everybody expected to come shows up before moving on.

, There are countless things you can do at a sleepover. Here are some things you can do. Be flexible when choosing what to do, and try to choose something everybody wants to do.


Manicures. Play some of your favorite music, get out the nail polish, and paint each others nails.
Make up a special day. If you want to maximize the fun, and you want a theme for your party, just make up a special day. Ex. Music Video Day! You can dress up and have a fun time on maybe Youtube, Instagram, or even Facebook.

Makeovers. Get out all your makeup, and see who wants a makeover. Take pictures of all the different makeup styles you use. At the end, choose the one that looks the best. Or even do blind makeovers. A good game to do that with is "" Blind Fold Makeovers
Play Master Chef. Get some food items and make a mini mystery box challenge with your friends. Judge them and then enjoy a yummy meal. You can even film it to see all the fun memories.
Talk about boys. A sleepover is one of the only times girls can talk about the boys they like. Remember to keep secrets. Nobody wants one of their secrets out!
Do a prank competition. After 10pm. Tell everyone to stop eating food which will keep you up like caffeinated drinks and sugary food. The first person who sleeps, gets a prank from the other guests. Make sure your guests are even like, two light sleepers and two heavy sleepers. Also make sure everyone is fine with this competition.
Stock up on junk food, and goodies. Caffeinated drinks and sugary foods are good for staying up all night. Good snack foods include popcorn, pretzels, cookies, crisps, gummy bears, chocolate, etc. Ask your friends beforehand if they have any food allergies. If your parents are having difficulties (money wise), ask your friends to bring a little something such as a few chocolate bars or cookies so that your parents don't have to spend all their money on junk food. if this is something around two months away do extra chores around the house or (if old enough) get a job.
Watch movies. You can rent them or you can pick some from your home collection. What's a sleepover without a movie or two? ""Easy A"", ""Mean Girls"", or ""Bridesmaids"" are always good. Just make sure that everyone there is comfortable watching whatever movie you pick and no one gets too scared! If you want, ask around before the sleepover to see if anyone wants to watch a certain movie. Try to stick with PG-13 movies, as most parents don't like it when their kids watch R rated movies due to inappropriate content. You could also ask your guest to bring movies; that way, everyone will have at least one movie that they want to watch.
Plan some fun slumber party games and activities:

""Pick a Question"": Everyone writes down a few questions, such as ""Who will be the first to get married?"". Then everyone answers them on a note pad.
Play ""Would You Rather"": Ask questions to each other, like, """" So childish but funny at the same time because you have to answer.

Play truth or dare.

Play Charades or Sardines or Play Man Hunt, which are great group games.
Play Murder in the Dark or Ghost in the Graveyard.
Board games and card games are another option. Ask people to bring their favorites.
Game console games. This includes Wii, PlayStation, and Xbox games. If you don't have enough remotes, take turns. Remember, nobody should feel left out.


Tell secrets. Make up ghost stories or read them from a book.
Buy a plain pillowcase and some permanent markers and have you and your friends sign it and doodle on it.
Have your computer ready! You obviously have a computer if you're reading this article, so be sure that your friends are going to want to go on it to update their Facebook status, look at pictures of hot celebrities, or anything else.
Dance to music, provided your guests want to. If you have an iPod or MP3 player, make a slumber party play-list with all of your favorite songs. If you have a stereo, ask everyone to bring in their favorite music so you can play them during the sleepover. Another option is to simply turn on a radio station that you all love.

Prank calls. Prank calls are fun, just make sure you don't prank call people after 10pm. Don't prank call strangers or businesses. Friends are usually okay to prank call. Never prank call someone who can't take a joke. Also make the prank calls Funny NOT Threatening.
Read the latest teen magazines. For teen girls, this usually means gossip magazines. Go buy some or have the ones you already have out and ready to be read by your friends. Don't bring out ones that are more than a year old, because then the news in them will be old.
Take Selfies. If you girls have social networking sites like Facebook or Instagram, you can post and share the pictures afterwards.You can also have fun with snapchat filters.
Have a fashion show in all your cutest trends. If someone isn't very trendy/doesn't have nice clothes, have some on hand.
Chopped is always fun to do at a sleepover. Have a parent buy 2-4 ingredients that you and your friends have to use while cooking. It's best to play this with four friends, and break into teams of two. If you have an odd number of people, have someone be the judge. If you have an even number, have a family member judge (make sure no one plays favorites!). You can play with one team as well. After you make the food, serve food too the judge/s then eat the other teams recipe. After you eat, find out who won. Making the good will be a blast. Ask whoever bought the ingredients to get something with a theme, or make sure it's disgusting! But make sure the host doesn't have any advantages. Make sure everyone knows where things are, and the host doesn't know ingredients beforehand.

, Pizza is a popular dinner for teen sleepovers, but any food will do.


Make sure you have a proper dinner so no-one gets the grumps later, this could really be a shame if it took a lot of time to organize it.

, Generally, girls will stay up until around 3- 4 A.M. Make sure all your guests have a place to sleep. Avoid keeping sleepy girls awake. Don't prank them in their sleep, unless they have approved you can do so.

, Pancakes are popular, but if you don't know how to make them or your parent isn't there to do it, stick with cereal.

, Watching movies in the morning isn't recommended, but you still can. Watch movies mainly in the afternoon, evening and night.

, Order or prepare with your parents.

Too many people will be hard to keep happy, have fun, and you'll need more room to sleep and more food. Just invite some of your closest friends and try not to exclude anyone. You'll have more fun with people you really know, and you'll feel more comfortable, as well as them. You could invite just one friend, but usually, a small group is loads more fun. Anywhere from three to six friends is a good amount. Keep these things in mind before deciding who and who not to invite:


Try inviting a girl you want to know better, making sure to be friendly towards her to make her feel welcome. This doesn't mean a total stranger, but maybe you came across a girl at school who loves, for example, Harry Potter. If you have a similar hobby or interest, you can do that at the sleepover while making a new friend. But, don't invite more than two people you don't know well. There could often be awkward silences, and you may make your closer friends left out.
Don't invite the ""popular"" girl(s). Unless you are actually friends with them, inviting these girls is generally not a great idea. Just because she is popular doesn't mean you'll be all ""cool"". What will you even do? And anyway, what about your actual friends?;
, You'll need dinner, dessert, breakfast, snacks, and drinks. Try buying the food only a couple days before, so you won't eat it all! You can also go out to eat ice cream, dinner, or breakfast (but not all three!). Try picking food that isn't very different, something that everyone will probably like. Don't get, for example, fish or veggie burgers. You can, however, have a choice of regular or veggie burgers. So, always have something that everyone will want to eat. Below are some simple suggestions for all the food and drinks you'll need. But, you can also think of your own!

Dinner-The most common dinner at a sleepover is pizza, which pretty much everyone likes. If you're getting pizza, always have at least one plain and one with a topping. (pepperoni always works). Other dinner choices are chicken, pasta, hot dogs and hamburgers. Know what your friends like, but if you don't know, just get pizza.






Dessert-For dessert, be creative! A great idea is to make dessert at the party, like ice cream sundaes, cupcakes, or a cake. You can just decorate them, or make them from scratch. Or, you can have a premade cake or brownies. It will save time if you want to do more activities.






Drinks-Always have water and soda. Sprite is always good to get, but if your friends like Coke, 7 Up, Root Beer, etc., get those as well. Fruit juice is good, too.






Breakfast-For breakfast, make your own waffles or pancakes, or have a parent make them. You can also have french toast sticks. Always have some delicious fruit, and orange juice and milk to drink.
Snacks-Of course you'll need snacks. Stock up on chips, pretzels, veggies with ranch or yogurt dip, popcorn, candy, fruit, etc. Always have something healthy!







, If your bedroom is big enough for the amount of people coming over, that's a great choice. Make sure that, if you are sleeping in your bedroom, that there is enough floor space. It would be unfair for the guests to sleep on the floor and for you to sleep on your bed. Unless your room has a lot of floor space, sleep somewhere else. If a large area in your basement is finished, sleep there. An alternative is the family/mud/living room. Anywhere that has a TV, floor space, and a table for snacks should be a good place to sleep and hang out.


Try to pick a hangout spot where siblings and parents generally won't be. You wouldn't want to be bothered, unless you want your brother or sister joining in on the fun. Try to find out where in the house they'll be (most likely their room), or if they won't be in the house at all!

, Get a trash bag and throw away any junk. Put dirty clothes in the washer or hamper, and put clean ones away. Dust off the TV, and bring any pillows, blankets, and sleeping bags to where you are sleeping. If necessary, vacuum the floor. Put all snacks in bowls and set them on a table. Charge your iPod (if you have one) so it will be ready to play. Make sure you have lots of games and movies, too. You don't have to do any major cleaning, just make sure the floor is clean, and your house looks presentable.


Another good idea is to clean the bathrooms. Your guests will be going there, so it better be fresh and clean for them! Plus, your parents will be proud. Take out the bathroom trash, fix any rugs, change the toilet paper, soap, and towel, and clean the sink. If you don't know how to clean the toilet, leave that to your parents.

, Get some different colors of nail polish and give each other manicures and pedicures. If you want, do some nail art for extra pizazz. You could also get some gem stickers to stick on your nails. Have fun, and be creative with colors and designs. Check out these articles for cool ideas:


Newspaper Nails
Panda Nail Art
Checkered Nails
Comic Strips
Facebook Nails
Harry Potter Nails
Popcorn Nails

, Sit in a circle and have music playing if you want. Have somebody to go first, and ask ""Truth or Dare?"" For truth, ask an embarrassing question. For dare, make the player do something scary, slightly painful, or just plain weird. Remember, though, don't make truths too personal, and you don't have to answer! Same with dares. Never do anything dangerous. Your friends will understand, and if they don't, they aren't good friends.


Good Dares:Make out with a pillow/stuffed animal, make an impression of somebody in or out of the group, describe someone in the group in 5 words and have everyone guess who it is, have a conversation with the wall.
Good Truths:What's the most embarrassing thing you've ever done, Who is your crush, What's the baddest thing you've ever done, If you could change three things about yourself what would they be?

, Whatever you can find works great, but some ideas are UNO, Scene it (with your favorite movie), Twister, and Clue. Play one of these if guests seem to get bored, or just for fun! Make sure that all guests are familiar with the rules. If not, quickly explain them to them or just play the game and have them learn as you play. However, games like Twister and Uno are easy and pretty much everyone knows how to play those games.

, What sleepover doesn't have movies? You should probably watch movies at nighttime, but not when guests are about to fall asleep. Bring out the popcorn, turn off the lights, and get a bunch of movies for guests to pick from. You can always watch the other ones later, but take this vote for movies to watch first. Make sure that everyone is okay with whatever movie you are watching, and don't watch PG 13 and/or R rated movies unless you have permission by your parents and all the guests' parents. Here is a list of some movies you can watch if you happen to like them:


Harry Potter
Pirates of the Caribbean
The Clique
Ella Enchanted
Up
Despicable Me
Another Cinderella Story
Elf
Mean Girls

, Crafts are a great idea if you don't want to be bored, and it's a memory for you and the guests to take home. This is an inexpensive and fun thing to do at a sleepover. Here are three simple ideas for crafts and how to make them:



Picture Frames. Take a group shot of you and your friends, and get some wooden frames, paint, foam stickers, and glitter paint. Decorate and be creative.

Necklaces. Get string, beads, and scissors to string on cool patterns. There are some kits for necklace making, so you can get one of these for extra beads and string.

Decorate pillowcases. Get some colorful fabric markers, glue, gems, and jewels, and get decorating, writing, and drawing! You can have everyone sign their name on the case.

, Blast the tunes and sing to the top of your lungs (unless others are sleeping, then tone it down a bit). You can do karaoke or just sing to your iPod. Dance, too. You can have a dancing or singing competition if you want, but don't leave your friends out. Let everyone win at some point. Or, you can make up your own dance to a song as a group and record it to watch later. If you have a disco ball or flashing lights, don't forget them!

, Although you may think that you're a little old for dress-up, you're not! Instead of just dressing up, have a fashion show. Find some old hats, beads, Halloween costumes, wigs, anything that you and your guests can wear. Take turns being the judge, and judge the girls (be nice) on style, creativity, anything you want from 1 to 10, 10 being the best. Have each girl pick their song and strut your stuff!

, Do this when you are getting tired, but still don't want to go to sleep. Catch up with each other, and talk to your heart's desire! Don't hurt feelings, of course. Everybody loves some juicy gossip at a sleepover. Talk about crushes. What girls don't? Who is cute/funny/totally a jerk? If you want to, look through an old school yearbook to see the boys. You could also talk about sports (which do you like/dislike) or school (teachers/tests/homework).


If you find that everyone is totally silent, crack a few jokes, tell scary stories, or play ""Would you rather?"". For would you rather, take turns asking each other what they would rather do. For example, would you rather lose an arm or a leg, kiss _________ or __________, walk into a glass wall in front of ____________ or step in a giant hole in front of ________?

, Popcorn, chips, ice cream, soda, and maybe even pizza rolls work good. If anyone has any allergies, try not to include those foods.

, Get out the nail polish, and if you have a make-up kit, get that out, too.

, Get a couple comedies, some scary movies, and dramas. That way, everyone's happy.

,, Some fun games are:


Blob tag. It starts out with one person as the blob, and they tag people. The people they tag connect arms with them and go to tag other players. When the blob has six people, they can split into two groups of three.
Hide-And-Seek tag. The person who's It counts to thirty with eyes closed and the others go and hide. The It person has to find them and tag them. The first one to be tagged is the new It. Or the last person can be It.
Volleyball, kick ball, baseball, etc. You get it.

,, If you have a trampoline, you can sneak out at like, 3 am and jump on it. If it's cold out, stay inside and..


Play truth or dare.
Tell scary stories.
If it's not too late, prank call boys/pizza places.
Do make-overs.
Practice gymnastics.

, Mess around for a few more hours, or until they get picked up. After everyone leaves or there's only your really close friend left, clean up.

, Do just one or a few of these. You don't need much, and you can still have fun inside or outside.

, You can decorate cookies with frosting, sprinkles, and m&ms. Or, make chex mix to have for movies. Put in pretzels, m&ms, popcorn, raisins, and marshmallows. You can also roast marshmallows when it's starting to get dark out.

, Play flashlight tag! It's the same as tag, but with flashlights in the dark. In the summer, run through a sprinkler if a nearby pool is not available. Go for a walk if it's still light out. You could also work on your gymnastics (make sure everyone knows how to at least a cartwheel first, and if not, teach them how.)

, Don't worry if it's raining, just go to the movies. You can put on makeup with your eyes closed (make sure you clean up, though). Play hair salon. Braid the hair, or give each other ponytails or buns with cool hair clips, barrettes, and scrunchies. If you are bored, play Charades. Make your own videos or take a lot of pictures of each other. Or, play Wii. Some good games are Mario Kart, Wii Sports, and Just Dance 2, but anything works. Hide and seek is also a great game, and you don't need anything.

Since it's a sleepover, you should go all out on the sweets and drinks.,
For drinks, make sure you have lots of fizzy juice, try and get stuff you might not normally buy because it is a sleepover.",How to Host a Sleepover Party for a Wide Range of Ages2," Sugary stuff is great, but remember to have other options e.g. pizza, crackers or even fruit because sometimes at 3:00am you might not feel like chocolate or other sugary foods. Remember to check if your guests are vegetarian or vegan or have allergies because a trip to the hospital at 2:00am because Molly ate a Snickers when she has nut allergies will definitely put a damper on the night., For example maybe if you see some blueberry fizzy juice at your local super market. Even if you all hate it, it could still come in handy for penalties in truth of dare. Once again remember to check if your guests have allergies."
"
At a sleepover the time you go to bed and the time you fall asleep are two very different times.,Everyones different but it probably isn't a good idea to make younger kids go to bed earlier than the older kids because they will be to anxious about thinking about what they are missing to sleep.,A good idea is to watch a movie while in bed then the younger ones might doze off if it's late (some of the older kids might as well) and then the kids who are still awake can talk or play a quiet game.",How to Host a Sleepover Party for a Wide Range of Ages3," If there are younger kids (6-7 years old) maybe pulling an allnighter isn't the best idea because it will be you who puts up with the temper tantrums the next day.,,"
"It can be tough finding games that will suit all age groups because what a 7 year old would find fun a 12 year old probably won't, but there are ways of modifying games so that everyone has a good time.,
Murder in the Dark is a very good classic sleepover game and its bundles of fun.There are many different ways of playing but this way is my favorite.,Hide and Seek in the dark is another good game.,
If you and your guests like making movies then go for it.,Make friendship bracelets.,
Build a den.,Pillow fights are also great just make sure the pillows don't have any hard zips or anything on them.",How to Host a Sleepover Party for a Wide Range of Ages4,", Before your guests arrive, cut out cards that are all the same size (one for each guest e.g. if there are 5 people coming make 5 cards) write murderer on one and detective on another and suspect on the rest. If there are children coming who can't read/are not confident readers draw a shape beside each one and for example say - if you have a square on your card you are the murderer. Everyone keeps their card a secret. The lights go out and if you are the murderer you have to tap people and they have to scream and fall over however if you are the detective and you get tapped you have to put the lights on and try and guess you the murderer is. If they guess right they win but if they don't the murderer wins.,, There are loads of great apps that can help you with that and they are a great way to remember your sleepover.,, Indoor or outdoor dens/forts are great fun to make and fun to hide out in. They are also great because all kids from 7 to 12 mostly like making dens so its something everyone can join in with.,"
"
Make sure your parents are okay with this.,
Determine the reason for this party.,
Get needed supplies.,
Decide on the guests.,
Make the invitations.,
Once you've bought everything you will need, set up the scene and begin making the food!,
Be a good host.,
After the party, clean up.",How to Throw a Party in Middle School," The most embarrassing thing that could happen would be having to send home all of your invited guests because your parents weren't told about this! Inform them that you would like to host a party for (insert event here) because (insert reason here). Tell them how many guests you want to invite. Be willing to make sacrifices and changes to your plans...after all this is your parents' house and they are in control of you. For example, your parents might not let you invite the whole 8th grade but they'll let you invite a few close friends over, or they might let you invite girls but not boys. Also understand that they will most likely want to be present when your party is taking place to make sure nothing ""bad"" is happening. You'll just have to accept whatever your parents want from this or there might not be a party!;
, Is it to honor someone? Is it for a special event like a birthday or anniversary? Is it for a holiday like Halloween or Christmas? Or is it just a fun gathering of all your friends after school? You will need to determine the reason behind your party so you can get the appropriate supplies. For example, if you're throwing a Halloween party it'd be inappropriate to have Santa Claus napkins and plates, just like if you were having a Christmas Party you wouldn't want pumpkin decorations. Once you've determined the meaning for your party, you've already got one part down!

, This includes games, decorations, food and drinks, etc. Make sure you buy things that match the meaning for your party. If you have a budget, consider borrowing or making your own things, or visiting cheaper stores with on-sale prices. You don't have to spend a thousand dollars on supplies, just make sure that your party is going to be furnished and your guests will have something to munch on and play. For example: if you're having a Halloween party, a good drink to buy would probably be orange punch, apple cider and/or soda. If you're having a birthday party good decorations would be balloons, streamers, lights, etc. Don't be afraid to go all-out but don't overdo it too much or it will look stupid, overdone and tried too hard!

, Decide who you're going to invite. Make sure that every person you invite isn't going to ruin the party, cause a scene, harass any guests or get you in trouble by your parents. If they're known for wrecking parties or toilet papering someone's front lawn, it probably won't be the smartest thing to do to invite them unless you want a mess to clean up, unhappy guests or an angry parent or two. You might just want close friends or the whole school, but whatever you choose make sure it's A) okay with your parents and B) a good and safe choice. Don't feel bad about not inviting someone who is only going to ruin your party anyway...if they truly are party wreckers they don't deserve to be invited to the party! It's not like someone forced them to do those bad actions in the past, it was THEIR doing and THEIR decision and you shouldn't feel obligated to invite anyone.

, These can be hand-made, bought, or computer printed. If this is for close friends or a very serious subject, hand making each card is probably your best choice. If you're inviting a lot of people you should probably save the hand pain and time and just buy or print off every invite. Make sure the invites are decorated nice...you don't want it to look silly or stupid because believe it or not, people might think it will be a terrible party just based on how your invite looks! You might want to paste or hand draw a pretty picture or design. You could also consider making an event on Facebook, that way you won't have to make any invites AND you can already have a good estimate for how many guests are coming (it notifies you every time someone says they are, aren't, or might show up). Make sure to include:


Who it's for/the host
The time and date: your guests need to know when to arrive!
The location: Your guests need to know where to go.
Reason for the party: rather it be a Valentine's Day party or an anniversary party, make sure to include it.
RSVP section: this needs to have your phone number so they can call or text and let you know if they are coming so you will know how many guests to expect

, Make sure your house is CLEAN. No socks on the kitchen floor, no unmade beds and no mac and cheese stuck on the ceiling. That's just embarrassing! Clean up everything and begin setting up the scene. Put up all of your decorations in their designated place and begin working on the food and set that out, too. You can also get a radio and play a likable radio station or get a DJ/ make your own CD of party hits (or songs for your event...for example, if it's a Christmas Party Santa Claus Is Coming To Town might be on the CD).

, When your guests arrive, show them around the house or introduce them to other guests they might not know. Make sure every guest is having fun. If you see a guest crying in the corner because they just got dumped by their boyfriend, ask what's wrong, take them to a private place to lend a shoulder for crying, and offer them a ride home. You want to balance being there for everyone and having fun. You have big shoes to fill. Also make sure that everyone is safe and no drama is going on. You have the authority and right (since this is your party and house) to kick anyone out if needed. Don't hesitate if someone is getting hurt or if someone is the cause of drama and stress for the rest of your guests to kick them out of the scene.

, Make sure you don't expect your parents to do the cleaning-you might not ever be able to have a party again. Store or throw things away, refrigerate left over food, etc.

"
"
Find out when your parents are leaving and how long they will be gone, but do not act suspicious when finding out this information because parents can just vibe that stuff.,
Gather a group of friends to help you remove valuables that may get broken or stolen during the event.,
Try to remember where everything goes so your parents don't know you had to move items.,
To prevent the party from being busted by the police, leave exterior lights off, draw all the blinds in the house and instruct attendees to park cars far away, such as at a nearby parking lot or on an adjacent street.

,
Be relatively quiet and don't crank up the tunes so loud that it will wake up the whole neighborhood.

,
To minimize the presence of cars further, carpool.,
Use a separate trash bag for alcohol-related trash and throw it out in a nearby business's dumpster.

,
Tell guests to smoke cigarettes outside.,
If using the Internet to communicate party plans, erase the related logs from your instant messaging client if your parents use your computer.

,
Do damage control.,
Be responsible.,
Lock all doors (if you have keys) of rooms you don't want anyone to enter.

,
After the party, clean up everything and put back all the valuables prior to parents getting back home.

,
Relax until parents get home.

",How to Throw a Party and Hide It from Your Parents,";
, Store them in a safe place, and remember or record where all of them go. Many people will notice if something they see every day is even slightly out of place. A good tip is to take a picture of each room so you have something to look at when you're trying to put the room back together.

, Taking pictures with your cell phone can be helpful in remembering how beds with decorative pillows are made and how the house looked before. Just remember to delete when you're done!

,,, It saves the environment, too!

,, The smell of cigarette smoke in a house is irreversible and will stay there forever.,, Broken items have to be replaced before your parents get home!

, The worst thing that can happen is having a drunk friend drive home. This will ensure that not only does he get jail time, but that you will get caught for the party and others could be injured. Your parents are likely to be liable.

After discussing budgets, find a venue that is both affordable and offers the options you would like to accompany your party.,
After booking the event, find invitations at a local stationary store or online.,
Visit the florist, discuss red and white flower options.,
After establishing a court, you may like an all girl court or to have each girl have an escort.,
While at the florist discuss some other details:


Dais flowers.,
Alternate the colors between red and white daisies, get an odd number so there will be a middle of the arrangement, such as 5 vases, with the outside flowers being red, the next in are white and the center is red.,
Hair clip.,
Court flowers.,
Decide if you would like a floor length or shorter dress.,Find a cake boutique, your venue may have one they work with often, discuss the red black and white theme with them and plan a cake large enough to feed your guests that also fits with your theme

,
Ask your venue if they could recommend any DJs, they will almost always have some that they will recommend.

,Make little labels with a damask to put on the address and return labels as well as cardstock place cards

,
Order and set everything and enjoy your party.

","How to Throw a Black, White, and Red Sweet 16"," Most venues offer a party room with dance floor, tables, chairs, place settings, table cloths. Normally, you can change minor details in the dinner and dessert menu, along with amount of chairs and settings at each table and tablecloth colors. Make sure you go over what your theme is before planning ahead;
, Get the invitations in a black white and red pattern. Some are white paper with black lettering and black damask pattern along with a red ribbon and monogram. Order extra invites just in case you need to send to family or if too many people RSVP negatively, you can send out more. Make the RSVP date a month before your party, request the guests to dress in white and black attire, the invites are a great place to include a request to join your court of honor, or to escort you to the party.

, Roses are a classic choice but may seem a bit mature for a sweet 16 party and a more youthful alternative is daisies which come in both red and white. For my personal arrangement, 4 bouquets of 6 red daisies and 3 bouquets of 6 white daisies. The flowers are straight in a cylindrical vase which is inside a round fish bowl vase and anchored by black natural rocks. For the red arrangements, a black betta fish will swim in the fish bowl vase and for the white arrangements, a red betta fish will swim. This gives the effect of a fish in with the flowers without subjecting the fish to the dangerous chemicals on the flower stems. I have already determined each fish home after the party, each with an experienced fish owner.

, Ask your girls to wear red dresses and all your guys to wear black pants, a white dress shirt, a black blazer, and a black tie. Ask your escort to wear the same with a red tie.

, A couple of options:
square, 4x4 vases with a single floating blossom.

,


5 square vases in a row, outside 5x5, the next two in are 4x4 and the center is 3x3. if you've used other flowers along with the daises maybe put a red daisy bloom in the 5x5, a white cymbidium orchid in the second two inner two and the center a red rose bloom.

, Ask your florist if she could make the daisy into a hair clip or onto headband. Red if you're having a black and white dress and white if you're having a red dress.

, Give each of your court guys a red daisy boutonniere so they stand out, consider giving your girls a white daisy corsage. Give your escort a white daisy boutonniere .

, if you decide on a floor length, go for a red or red black and white print, if you go for a shorter go for a black white and red print or a black an white print and purchase a red silk sash from a dress boutique.

Make a guest list.,
Be sure to include all the information on the invitation.,
Now the fun part: the menu!,
Find a place in your house and start readying it.,
It's a few days until the party.,
Have your family get involved!,
Wear something nice and fancy, like a party dress.,
If you want, hand out ""goodie bags"" when guests are leaving.,
Help with the clean up!",How to Throw a Dinner Party (for Teen Girls)," Who do want to invite? Just family, for example, your uncles, aunts, grandparents etc.? Or do you want to invite just friends? And if you want to invite family and friends too, be cautious. Your friends may not find Uncle Harry's impression of Donald Duck exactly entertaining. Keep in mind the size of your home and dining area, as well as tables. You wouldn't want to invite 30 people and only have two tables that seat 4 people each. Also keep in mind the menu when thinking of guests. When you have your guest list, proceed!;
, Be sure to also tell them to dress up a little (in formal clothes) Send one to everyone on your guest list!

, The first thing you have to do is figure out the beverages. A very fitting drink for this is sparkling juice. It looks very nice in good glassware and will start things off on a good note. Also offer water (sparkling and regular), iced tea, coffee, and/or hot chocolate. All of these do not have to be on the table, but a few would be nice. Your next step is figuring out 2-4 different appetizers. These could include: veggies and dip, fruit and dip, salad, soup, deviled eggs, vegetables or meat on a skewer, pinwheels, etc. Notice if any guests are vegetarians, and if they are, offer some veggie dishes as well. The next part: the entrée! You should have 2-3 entrees to offer. These could include: chef's salad, mini sandwiches, chicken (grilled, baked, etc.) meat kebabs, shrimp cocktails, meatballs, raviolis, mini-pizzas, pasta, and if you don't mind spending a bit much, you could offer steak! The next part is easy: the sides! Try mashed potatoes, cooked veggies, pasta, salad, soup, corn, cinnamon apples, rice, bread sticks, etc. Next: The after-dinner treats! This is optional, but nice when waiting for desserts. Offer treats like hot tea, coffee, hot apple cider, and light things like Italian bread and butter, cinnamon apples, or mini-bagels. Think breakfast foods. Last but not least: the dessert! Offer ice cream, cupcakes, crème brulee, penne cotta, pumpkin/banana/apple bread, apple crisps, cobblers, gelato, etc. After you have picked at least 3 choices for each category (drink, appetizer, entrée, side, op. snack, and dessert), write it all down on a menu for each person.

, If you don't already have a large table where everyone can sit, borrow or rent one. It's better to have everyone sitting in one place then at separate tables. If that is the case, have the tables very close to each other. See? This is where less people is better. You can also put multiple tables next to each other and put a fancy tablecloth over them. You want a tablecloth anyway. Try to find a nicer one, or try to buy one. Set out fine china (if you own it and are allowed to use it) or nice looking glassware. Don't forget silverware! Try to match all the plates (glasses, silverware etc.) with each other. For example, don't have a blue plate with a silver one, and a round glass with a square one. Try to match them as much as possible. Not enough utensils? Buy clear, plastic dinnerware at your local grocery store.

, What do you do? Cook! Whip out your menu and have a cooking fest with your family! If you have no clue about a recipe, look it up! You are bound to get thousands of results online or in cookbooks. Freeze what can be frozen and refrigerate what can be... well, you know what. For everything else, cook or bake it the morning of the party. Don't forget to thaw the frozen stuff! Guests don't want to eat frozen soup! If you wish, cook things while guests are arriving. This makes things better and fresher.

, Have your dad and little brother wear suits and ties, or even tuxes. Moms and sisters can wear dresses or skirts! You can have your family eat dinner with you, or if it's guests only (plus you), assign jobs! Your dad can be the waiter, your mom can prepare food, your sister can take coats, your brother can pour drinks or fetch extra napkins. Make sure they are having fun, though!

, Don't wear your $800.00 designer dress though, you don't want to spill your meal on that. Greet guests at the door and lead them to their seats. (Or have a family member do it) Have little name cards already at the seats. Have a family member hand out menus and take orders. Have fun though! It doesn't have to be all quiet and formal! Have a bowl of conversation starters to pass around, play a game of cards, What Am I?, I-Spy, or 20 Questions.

, Include recipes for a few of the foods eaten, jewelry, wrapped chocolates, mints, gift cards, notepads, pens, etc. Do not include cheap plastic stuff though because it just makes the party end on a low note.

, Don't leave it all to your parents!

Make sure any pre-sleepover arrangements have been made!,
Everyone needs to know where it is, what time they are to come round, how much money they should bring etc!

,
(On the day) Meet up with one friend who is willing to help you organise everything.

,
Tidy the house!,
Go food shopping.,
Put away all the shopping away and take a few plastic bags which will be used as the rubbish bins for the night.

,
Prepare any music or films that will be used.

,
Get everything ready!,
When your guests arrive, show them a place to keep their belongings and pour them all drinks to start off the night.

,
Call your parents!,
Assign 2-3 people to cook the dinner.,
Put some music on!,
Don't worry!,
Have fun!

,
(Morning) Have breakfast together and discuss how the night went and if it would be a good idea to do it again.

,
Get ready.,
TIDY UP!!!,
Make sure the house is exactly how it was when you arrived.

,
if you have spare food you bought at the shop, either bin it or give it to one of your friends, your mum will be confused if she finds food that wasn't there before!

,
Say goodbye to your friends and enjoy the rest of your day!

",How to Host a Sleepover With No Adults Present (Preteens & Teens),";
,,, Hoover, clean the kitchen, make up any beds, get everything ready for your guests arriving. (obviously wait until your parents are out as this will look quite suspicious.. unless of course you have permission!)

, You and your friend must go to the local supermarket and stock up on food and drink, you won't want your parents returning to find all the food is gone.

,,, Blow up any airbeds, anything that needs cooked for a long time should go in the oven now etc.

,, (if you do not have permission for this sleepover then tell them that you are at your friends house, having a sleepover, assure them that you are safe and well (this will keep them off your case during the night).

, Its not ideal if one person is stuck in the kitchen all the time, if there's not too many of you then you could all cook your own. On the other hand its not ideal if there's lots of you crowding the kitchen trying to cook.

, It will make everyone happier and lighten the mood!

, Your parents won't find out if you follow these steps. Do not run around after your friends all night shouting at them to not make a mess, they are at a sleepover, they can't help it plus they are the guests. Put all the dishes beside the sink and the rubbish in the bin to clear up in the morning.

,,, Get dressed, brush your teeth, wash your face and put your makeup on.

, Everyone pull together and tidy the house! Your parents will flip if it's a bombsite when they get back. Give everyone a job: someone to hoover, someone on dishes, someone on rubbish etc. Put some upbeat music on to motivate everyone with their chores.

, Make sure they're okay with you throwing a party, and that they trust you enough to leave you alone. (Who wants parents hovering around the party, sniffing everyone's paper cups?)

, A good time is maybe the last day of school before Spring Break. Have people come to the location at about 6:30 PM (try to arrange it so that they arrive in groups), and let the party continue until around 1 AM. It seems late, but when you're having fun hanging out with people you know, time flies! But, with young teens (13-15 years) try to end it a little earlier, like 11:30 or 12:00, because your parents might object otherwise!

, The absolute best idea is to have it at your house. Keep it open-door, so the couples among your guests can go outside for a little privacy if they want to.

, This plan should include a list of all the things you want to do for the party, and a list of any scheduled games or events.

, Jot down what you need or keep it on a computer.

, Run this by your parents afterwards as well. Don't invite everyone just to be nice--this can ruin the party. People need to feel privileged to be invited, not pondering whether or not they were invited out of obligation or pity. Limit the guest list to close friends, people you want to get to know better, and people whose opinions could have an effect on your social standing at a later time. Don't invite people who don't like you or who don't like one of your closest friends. Invite girls and guys.

, Don't send little cards in the mail, and don't just go around school casually mentioning you're having a little party. Send out invites by email! If someone does not have an email address, it's okay to go up to them by their locker and write down on a slip of paper the address, the occasion, and someone else they know who will be coming.

, Be sure to include these things:


A boom box or a laptop somewhere in the corner with an iTunes window up for people to upload songs from iPods to play.
A somewhat scheduled time (i.e. ""somewhere between 9:00 and 10:30..."") for almost everyone to sit down in an open room with a big TV to watch a movie that everyone votes on.
A drawing for two tickets to the first showing of a movie that's going to be a really big deal.
During the earlier parts of the party, get someone you know to contribute a game console to be set up in a living area for free use.
At some point when it gets really dark, get a group of your friends to help you suggest a game of ManHunt.

, Don't forget, yours will be the party of the season!

, Before you go to ask your parents for permission or help, make a list of menu options (such as homemade, catering, bring-your-own-side-dish, etc.), activity options (board games? Holiday movies?), date and time possibilities, and special-case plans (such as what to do with young children, etc.).

, Calmly and respectfully, present your ideas to them and offer them the different options.

, Be careful to consider friendships, rivalries, space constraints, and personal issues (such as extreme shyness or alcoholism).

, It will make it much easier to purchase or make decorations if you already have your theme in mind.

, Depending on your theme, you may wish to host your party earlier or later in the day. Be sure to schedule it before people leave for vacations, and remember work and school hours.

, The best idea may be to host at your home, where you and everyone else will be familiar with the surroundings. However, you may wish to look into renting a small banquet hall or room at a restaurant.

, Be sure to provide a phone number that you can be reached on, and give clear directions. Write neatly!

Schedule the party around naptime.,
Choose your guests wisely.,
Pick your invite platform.,
Give guests a clue on what you’d like for gifts.,
Plan the food.,
If you’d like, make goody bags for the guests.,
Prep your toddler.,
If the kids are old enough, plan a few games.",How to Throw a Birthday Party1," The best time for a baby’s or toddler’s birthday is on a weekend afternoon. The parents are generally available for a couple of hours and the invited kids (birthday honoree included) can nap before or after. Choose a day that’s a 2-3 weeks out to give the parents advanced notice.


Have a start and end time, say 1-3 pm. This way no one shows up too late and they don’t feel pressure to stage an awkward exit at some point in the day; there will be an actual group exodus 2 hours later.
This makes it easy on the child ‘’and’’ easy on the parents. It’s no pressure and convenient, so they’ll be more likely to come. This is also a good amount of time to fit into everyone's schedules.;
, This is one of the only times in your child’s life where the guests are going to very different people of mixed ages. They’ll be friends, neighbors, family members, and children close to your child’s age, though not necessarily the same. Think about how many people you can handle being the host. Generally speaking, a good number is around 10.


The more ages and types you bring, the more you’ll have to be accommodating. If other young children are present, they’ll need entertaining. You’ll need ""adult food"" and ""child food,"" too. Think about what each person would need when you’re compiling your list.

, You’ll need to send out invites for the guests either via snail mail, email, or phone call. Having something tangible is best – a text or a phone call is easily forgettable. There are a few websites like Evite that can set up “personalized” invitations for you, too.The main benefit of snail mail is that you can make it truly your own. If you go this route, consider adding a personal touch with your baby’s handprint on the invite. That’s one for the scrapbook!
However, you’ll likely want to send out a phone call or a text 3-5 days before the party to make sure everyone has remembered the event and to gather RSVPs.

, Many parents don’t want more toys for their children. If you want something specific for gifts, be direct on the invitation. Indicate whether you want practical items, money or gift cards, or nothing at all. It’s not impolite – it’s saving them the hassle of buying something you don’t actually want.


However, stay away from demanding gifts that are too expensive, or demanding them in the first place. If they're watching their wallets, they'll be less likely to come if gifts are mandatory.

, Item number one on the checklist? Cake. That’s a given. But apart from that, what else will you need? Well, it depends on your guests. Cater to their ages – have some “adult” food and some “kid-friendly” food. You don’t need to plan a meal; just have snacks available throughout the party.


You can make a boxed cake seem like bakery-made heaven with the addition of mayonnaise or an extra egg. No need to spend a ton of money on a professional cake for a birthday your child will not likely remember. And this way you can get all the credit for the delicious dessert.

, Everyone loves a nice goody bag, especially if they went out of their way to get you a gift and make room in their schedule for your party. Show them you appreciate them coming with a goody bag, even if it’s just for the kids.


If it’s not for the adults, they’ll still be glad they came as their kids have something to keep them occupied. It’s more to show them your appreciation and to make it a day for everyone.

, If your child is old enough to understand, let them know what’s going to happen. A bunch of people are coming over to celebrate them. Presents! But it also means that other kids might see their stuff, that their routine will be interrupted, etc. If they understand what’s happening, they may stay calmer.


Let them know that this is a day of fun – it shouldn't be stressful or scary. Most of the time will be spent playing games, opening presents, and eating food.

, Having a bunch of 3-year-olds running around for 2 hours will not be the best birthday party for the books (especially according to the other parents). To be sure they stay at least semi-occupied, plan a few games for them (this also lets the parents enjoy themselves).


Need some ideas? Start out with a craft, keeping the kids entertained with coloring, paper, glitter, and whatever else you have around the house. Then move onto musical hot potato, freeze dancing, or a non-competitive round of musical chairs."

Plan a theme.,
Pick a guest list with your child.,
Organize a few activities.,
Keep the food simple.",How to Throw a Birthday Party2," Going to a restaurant or to a bowling alley is great, but your kid might go ga-ga over a themed birthday party – and you could even have that theme at the bowling alley anyway. It makes it easier to pick out decorations, design the cake, and choose activities. Talk to your child about what they’d like – it should come down to their preferences.


If your child has pretty outlandish taste (“I want a hashtag theme, mom!”), take him or her to the party supply store with you. Show them the options and let them pick from there.

, Now that your child is growing up, the guest list should be a collaborative effort. Cap it at around 7 or so other children, depending on how many other parents will be available (you don’t want to be left supervising 20 children on your own). Sit down with your birthday-er and pick out who they really, really want at their party.


Make sure invitations get handed out covertly. If only certain friends are getting invited, it should be handled with care so the other kids don’t get upset. You can either deliver them yourself, ask a teacher to hand them out with other items, or have your child do it covertly (if you think they can handle it).

, If kids are left to their own version of fun, you're going to enter the room finding spaghetti on the walls, chairs broken, and someone crying in the corner. Organize a few activities to keep everyone happy and the chaos to a minimum. Games with music, face painting, or craft making are trusty standards.


A warm up activity is good, too.That way as the kids trickle in, the early-birds are content having something to do.

, Kids are easily impressed. If you can whip up a bunch of mini corn dogs, their tummies will be smiling. Have a few healthier snacks (pretzels, a veggie plate), in addition to some candy and finger foods, like chips and salsa.


The time of the party will determine the food. If it's just in the afternoon, you'll only need snacks. During a meal? Try ordering pizza or getting take-out. What's the most important part? The cake, of course.

Talk your teen about what they’d like, where, and when.,
Plan out the guest list.,
Make sure the invites get sent out appropriately.,
Consider having a theme.,
Provide all the fixin’s for your party.,
Keep a watchful eye, but allow them their fun.",How to Throw a Birthday Party3," Now that your child is old enough, they should have a big say in their party. Do they want it at home or out? What do they want to do? Do they want it during the day or at night?


If they have a bunch of ideas, narrow it down for them to 3 or so that you've preapproved – they can then pick which one they want from there.
Talk about a budget and scheduling constraints. You'll have to be the voice of reason in this conversation. Be honest and let them know what's doable and what's not.

, Ask your teen to come up with ""the short list"" – 8 or so people they want at their party. Ultimately the party should be determined by where it is (if it's somewhere else, that's less work for you) and how long it's going to last. 8 people out for pizza is manageable, but you'll only want to take 3 or 4 to the amusement park.


You're finally at an age where it matters who gets invited – some people may not get along or not want to do certain things. Talk to your teen about what the people they're inviting are like, if they know each other, and any problems they foresee.
Consider doing it elsewhere, like at a restaurant, trampoline park, bowling alley or arcade. Your teen likely wants freedom, and it's easier on you, too.

, Teens are at an age where feelings can get hurt. If your teen is inviting some kids at school and not others, find a way to make it so the invites are sent out discreetly. If they're not, it might start unnecessary drama that could dampen the event.


If possible, send them via email. Ask for RSVPs so you know who is coming and can have a head count. Have your teen send reminder texts or phone calls, too, before the big day.

, Theme parties are fun for 4-year-olds, 40-year-olds, and everyone in between (though the themes change over time). Talk to your teen about having a theme – the kids can then dress up, you'll have fun planning out themed food, and it'll make it easier to decorate and find matching additions.


This should be your teen's decision. As long as it's appropriate and doable, it should be a go. If you don't like it, give your teen a good reason why and offer alternatives.

, This is especially important if you're having the party at home: plan and arrange all the food and decorate till the cows come home. With a theme it'll be easier to pick out; if you don't have one, it's up to you. Here's a few things to keep in mind:


Keep the snacks coming; worry less about the main food. You can always whip up spaghetti or order pizza, depending on what the party-goers feel like. But don't forget the cake!
To keep the mess better for you, buy plastic plates, forks, knives, and cups to keep the after-party clean-up to a minimum.
Don't be nervous to ask other parents to bring along a few dishes if the party is at your house. A few bags of chips or some liters of soda is an easy way they can chip in.

, You need to be there to problem-solve and diffuse any tension, but when things are going well, allow them their space and their fun. They're at an age where they can take care of themselves. Be as far away as you feel is appropriate.


Odds are your teen will need you to order the pizza or take care of any mess they create. While it may not be in the way you want, you'll likely be needed to stay relatively near.

Plan the who, what, when, and where.,
Send out the invites well beforehand.,
Choose a theme or over-arching activity.,
Cover all the food and drink necessities.,
Decorate the area according to your theme.,
Keep everyone mingling.",How to Throw a Birthday Party4," An adult birthday party can be anything from a few people gathering for drinks to a room full of people rocking out to live music. It all comes down to the preferences of the birthday honoree. Simple and classy or totally outrageous?


Having it at home is easiest, but that means cleaning, cooking, entertaining, and cleaning some more. However, having it at home is cheaper and you have free reign of your territory.
If you do have it at home, consider having everyone bring a dish or a drink. This keeps the burden off you and makes it a more interactive affair.
If you're going out, make a reservation as soon as possible. Some places are hard to get into on a moment's notice.

, Unlike kids, adults have a million and one things going on that they have to attend to. To get all your guests to come, send out invites well in advance, about 2 - 3 weeks. This way they can write down the party in their calendar before the slot fills up.


Send something concrete, like an email. A phone call or text is easy to forget and often doesn't seem official. But don't hesitate to send a reminder text a few days before the party.

, There are a couple of things that can make any party monumental:


Pick a theme, where your guests can dress up, eat special foods, and take part in themed activities. This could be anything – from an 80s theme with neon colors and bad movies, to golf with parfaits and mini-golf set up in the basement, to a cartoon character theme, where you get to relive your childhood.
Plan an event. It could be a photo scavenger hunt throughout the city, a pub crawl, or a macaroni and cheese tasting at your house (where everyone brings a different variation). This adds extra excitement about your party and keeps people from being bored, too.
Consider entertainment like live music or a sports game. With this route, all the planning is done for you.

, If you're having the party at your house, make sure everyone's well taken care of. You'll need hors d'oeuvres for people to munch on all night long, and food to accommodate everyone's allergies and diets. Some gluten-free and vegetarian plates may be a good idea.


What's more, you'll likely want alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks available. For those that don't drink, keep it fun by making a punch or some other concoction that makes them feel like they're a part of it, too.

, Did you choose ""Old Hollywood"" as your theme? Get some old film reels, some black and white decorations, and roll out the red carpet on your sidewalk. ""90s""? Bust out the scrunchies, the high-waisted jeans, the bright colors, and blast some Spice Girls. The limit is only your imagination – and your budget.


Don't have a theme? No problem. For that macaroni and cheese party, set up a large board for everyone to vote on or make them personalized voting cards. Make name tags and decorate the table to make the mac n' cheese look better than it already does.

, Since you're likely the glue that holds this party together, try your best to work in and out of circles, introducing them to one another, and starting games if the atmosphere calls for it.


Keep them safe, too. If drinking is involved, take their keys and put them in a safe place. When they go to leave, make sure they're sober before they drive away. If not, arrange a designated driver to take them home.

In fact, there are a lot of party ideas that you can use as themes for your birthday party.


A slumber party is usually done with a small group of no more than 5 people. It's the old faithful among party themes where a group of boys or a group of girls get together with sleeping bags and party.
A pool party is a great option for warmer months and can be done outdoors in conjunction with a barbecue.
A spa themed party is a great alternative to the childhood princess themed party. Girls get together and have a day of pampering at home with manicures, pedicures, and facials.
A video game themed party is a great way to incorporate your favorite video game or your love of video games into a party. Have guests cosplay characters and allow compete at playing video games as a cool party activity.
A bowling party is a great party idea away from home. Kids gather at a rented lane and take turns bowling over pizza and wings.;
, Get their permission to host a party for friends/classmates. Have an idea of where you'd like to throw the party, when, and a rough estimate of how many invitations you'd like to give. Establish rules and limitations with your parents.


Think of a budget based off of your party needs. If you're having a party at your home, more costs might be involved to give it more of a party feel, through balloons, banners, confetti, etc. While parties hosted at places where the theme is also the focal point for entertainment value (think bowling, an arcade, a movie theater, or amusement parks), the cost goes into the entertainment, but very little is needed in the decoration or food category. So think about which areas you would rather invest your money and base your budget on that.
Discuss the setting for the party and an end time for the party. Based on your budget and decision on a theme, decide on the place where you would like to host your party. If it is away from home, make a list of potential locations and contact each one. Make your final decision on price and convenience of the location. A proper end time for a tween/teen party is 9:30-10:00. Make sure you adhere to curfews.
Agree on a number of guests for your party that won't be exceeded. You might want to invite only friends or you might decide to invite your entire class. Make room for that potential decision when you discuss your number with your parents. Agree that there will be no more than 20 kids to chaperon and accommodate on the night of your party.
Learn of any expectations your parents may have for you, your friends, or your party. Do your parents want you to ask some of your guests' parents if they can help chaperon? Do your parents expect you to decorate on your own and clean up after? What kind of behaviors will they absolutely not tolerate? Provocative dancing, fighting, etc. It would be great to fill your parents with confidence about you and your friends ability to be trusted and responsible at your party.

, When making invitations base the list on people you enjoy spending time with while adhering to the number of people your parents approved of to attend the party. If it is a birthday party, try to limit the number of invites to around 20-25 people, keeping in mind that not everyone you invite will come. If the party's theme is more intimate, like a sleepover, limit the party to 5 or 6 people.


Decide on what kind of invitation you'd like to do: Eventbrite, Facebook, written, over the phone, or via email.
Request that all attendees RSVP with emergency phone numbers and food allergies if they have any (this will make party prep run more smoothly).
Decide whether plus-one's or a friend of a friend invitees are allowed to attend your party and include those details on your invites.

, Include all of the important details that should by now be concrete: time, date, location, the type of party it is, and the dress code. Start to formally invite guests at least two weeks in advance of the day of your party to ensure they can accommodate the date.


Ensure that there is a cut off of when RSVP's will be received for headcount purposes - this should be 3-5 days before the party's actual date.
Tally up all of the RSVP's you've received to keep track of who's attending your party and materials you'll need.

, Use your budget and theme to guide you as you make decisions for the groundwork of the party experience by creating a checklist.


Consider what kind of food and beverages will be offered, the kind of music that will be played, the decoration that will set the scene, and any party favors you'd like to provide.

, For parties, whether themed or no theme, run of mill decorations like balloons, confetti, streamers, and banners are not uncommon.


Go to stores like Dollar Tree and find these common decorations at a low cost.
Go to higher end stores, like Michael's, to find decorations that match with your theme.
Make your decorations unique and inject a little personality by going the decor road less traveled or visiting a local thrift store for decor.

Use pink paper lanterns as a unique, luxe alternative to the average balloon, for example.
Use mason jars as center pieces and thrift plates and table cloths to make for an elegant setup for your party and/or personalize them to match your party's overall theme.



, Party favors do not have to be complex in nature. They can be straightforward favors in their simplicity. They can also be sentimental and come with a lot of thought and effort. While you don't have to have party favors, they are a nice way to leave a lasting impression after a great night.Fill up a small gift bag with different lollipops and candies.
Use a small box to box an individual cupcake. Extra points if the cupcake is the same icing and flavor as the main birthday cake!
Gift guests with a notebook and a pen that you can personalize by writing their names on the front of.
Make friendship bracelets out of multicolored strings to give as party favors.
Create a ""mixtape"" out of blank CDs and your favorite songs from the previous year. This will be a great reminder of you and a memento of what you guys were probably listening to when you were a year younger.

, Cater to the needs of any food allergies that might have been mentioned in your invite's RSVP. Kids aren't hard to please when it comes to food so try to keep it as simple as possible, bearing in mind that in terms of importance, food is the icing while the birthday party is the actual cake.


Order party food staples like pizza, potato chips or pretzels, and sodas.
Make sure to order a cake, as well as ice cream options.
Provide healthy alternatives like vegetable or hummus trays.
Simple is good, but options are also good. Consider adding gluten-free foods to the menu as well.

, Keeping your guests entertained should be the host/hostess's main objective. While choosing to host a birthday party outside of your home may make that task a lot easier, hosting a birthday party from home will mean coming up with ideas of how to keep your guests from getting bored:


Consider group games everyone can play like Heads Up, Twister, Would You Rather, karaoke, and board games .
A great way to have fun and to provide keepsakes for guests is creating a makeshift photobooth using an empty wall as a backdrop. Incorporate handmade signs and silly props to personalize the photosets.

, These two friends can help you decorate and allow you to have people to talk to as you create the look and feel of your party.


Place decorations where you want them. Arrange balloons buy tying them onto individual chairs. Hang your banner towards the center of the room where the dancefloor and guests will be most of the night.
Set up stations of tables for easy access to appetizers and drinks if guests happen to need anything. Add centerpieces along the tops of the tables to add an extra wow factor in your party's details.

, If playlists are the way you are planning to create a soundtrack for the evening, set it up, and attach it to your sound system.


Make sure it is somewhere that guests have the option of acting as the DJ throughout the party if they would like to.
Make sure music choices are respectful to everyone: no profanity, no suggestive imagery, or explicit language.
Add special lighting to coordinate with the mood of the music. This not only adds to the ambiance, but also adds another layer to decor details. Consider purchasing colorful bulbs to make the room a different hue, dim the lights to radiate intimacy, or purchase special strobe lighting to emulate a nightclub feel.

, When it's finally time for the party to start, greet everyone with a smile and/or hug and talk to their parents for a few minutes. Remind the parents of the time the kids need to be picked up, etc.


If your guests have gifts for you, thank them and guide them to where the party is.
Make sure that upon entering, guests know where food, drinks, and the restroom is for their convenience.

, When everyone is there, dance, talk, and play games. Choose games that everyone wants to participate in and can feel included in.


Be the center of conversation and attention by going to people one by one and starting conversations. Make sure that they are having a good time and if you see someone looking bored, pull them in through conversation or inviting them to dance.
Start the party by choosing the first song to play. Get everyone jumping up and down and enjoying the music by asking them to follow your lead. Make your venue into a rock concert venue and mosh pit.
Encourage everyone to be in a social spirit by bringing games to the party. Have everyone gather around and start a group game like Never Have I Ever (a tamed version though), where people will listen and drink sodas for every ""never"" that's offered that they have done. It's a great way to get everyone involved while helping people connect over experiences they have had and experiences they haven't.
Divide the group of partygoers into halves and play a game of Charades or Pictionary. It is competitive, but also hilarious as you try to figure out what people are either acting out or drawing. Create a special prize like an extra party favor for the person or people with the most points.
Within a couple of hours of the party starting when guests are entertained and fed, roll out the cake and begin singing “Happy Birthday”.
Open presents and cards while being appreciative of everyone who gave you gifts. Make a show of the action by dramatically reading your cards. Be an actor and be entertainment while being gracious.

, The moment works best with songs that are based around dance routines, like ""The Electric Slide"" or ""The Cha Cha Slide"". More recent songs like ""Hit the Quan"" or ""The Wobble"" will work too. The intent is to get everyone up and moving for one last ""Hoorah"" before the night is through.


As parents start to arrive, give your guests hugs, and thank them for coming.
Hand out party favors to people leaving if you decided to create them.
Ask that one friend stays behind to help you as you start the cleaning up process.
Follow up with guests via text or email and thank them again for coming.
Create a Facebook album for photos taken from the party and tag guests in them. This cements the memories of a great evening forever.

Before the sleepover party starts buy candy.,
Get a secret stash.,
Drinks.,
Once your friend has come, make a map of your house.,
Games!,
Scary stories!,
Play hide and go seek.,
Make a movie on your Mobile device.,
Splash cold water on your face when you feel tired.,
Gossip and play truth or dare.",How to Pull an All Nighter with Friends," Make sure you have different types. Eating the same type can get a little boring. You may also feel sick and that's not good. Get about two or three different kinds of candy.;
, When you have got the candy, you need a hiding place for it. You can f. ex. put it in a basket and put a small blanket over it and hide it under your bed. But you can probably think of a better way. We all have different room set ups so what ever is best for you and your friend(s).

, Now you need some drinks. If you are going to have pop then only have a little. Yes pop does have caffeine in it but also a lot of sugar that could give you a sugar high or it will just make you crash. Some healthier drinks would be juice, everybody likes juice! And the healthiest drink: Water. Wouldn't you like a refreshing glass of water?

, Include any exits space you have such as closets, pantries, and lofts. You will need a map because you should be sneaking around in the house and be grabbing some midnight snacks, but if you make noises your parents might wake up and wonder what that bang was so, if that ever happened, just dash into a hiding spot.

, The first thing that comes into your mind right now must be electronics. Yes a great sleepover need electronics but... the light will make you a bit sleepy so why not board games? There are many games! Clue! Life! Scrabble! Bop it! Play games like those if you own them, and if you don't chicken out, play a Ouija board. (wee- jee board) If you don't know what a Ouija board is, then I recommend going to Google and type the museum of Ouija board. Or play an online Ouija board.

, Turn off the lights and grab a flash light, its time for scary stories.

, Somebody is it and now you just go hide until your friend finds you.

, You can download IMovie, video f. ex. live, horror movie maker and other video making apps. Decide the topic and play along.

, The cold water will wake you up.

, Those are always fun when it gets really late.

A large party will most likely be held at a big venue and be much more costly, and a small party can be held at your home as a much more personal event.Do you want to invite your entire grade level to the party?
Would you rather do something special with a few of your best friends?
Maybe you want to have a mid size party with close friends and family members.;
, The activities you do at your party can indicate what type of party you want to plan. If you want to have lots of dancing at your party, you will want to have a party where there is a dance floor and music playing. You might want to go on an adventure for your party by bringing several friends to do something fun like skydiving, and then celebrate by going out for dinner.You could have a pool party where everyone enjoys swimming and hanging out by the pool.
Renting out a roller rink and having a skating party is another fun option.

, You need to keep in mind the cost of different types of parties to choose one that will fit your personal budget. Parties at a rented venue with contracted services are going to be some of the most expensive options, and having a party at home with homemade food and activities will be the least expensive.


Some activities can be quite pricey even if you’re only inviting a few friends. Make sure you do a lot of research into the cost per person of different activities.
Many venues will allow you to bring in your own food and do your own entertainment. Spending money on a venue and then doing your own food, decorations, and entertainment can be a budget friendly option.

, The season you have your party in can help you come up with a theme for your sweet 16. Many fun themes come from the time of year it is, and it is easier to buy seasonal decorations if you go with a seasonal theme.If you have a summer party, you can have a luau, summer pool party, or sunshine themed party.
A party in the fall could have the theme of football, bonfire, camping, or just a fall colors.
Winter parties can be themed winter wonderland, snow kingdom or holiday themed.
If you have a spring party, you could go with a flower power theme, rainy day, farm animals, or pastel colors.

, Time period parties are very popular because guests can dress up for the party, and they can be transported back in time for a night of fun. If you choose to have a time period party, it’s best to have everything match the time period you choose. All of your decorations, music, food and drink, and invitations should reflect the theme.Have a Great Gatsby themed party from the roarin’ twenties.
A hippie themed party from the sixties is always a fun choice.
You can have a sock hop party theme from the fifties.
An eighties themed party is also very popular. Just decorate in neon colors, play eighties music, and tell guests to tease their hair big!

, Book and movie themed parties are a great choice for a sweet sixteen party. Pick a popular book or movie to base your theme off of, or choose one of your favorites. Decorate with movie posters or recreate scenes with your decorations. You can even ask guests to come dressed as a character.


Do a vampire themed party in honor of the Twilight series.
Have a wizard themed party if you enjoy Harry Potter.
You can go with a Hunger Games theme and have guests play a fun version of the Hunger Games.

, Most hotels have a ballroom that can be rented for parties. This is one of the more expensive options for a venue, but it also is one of the biggest. Most hotel ballrooms can accommodate a very large party, so it’s a great option if you plan on having a lot of guests., Some restaurants and entertainment centers will let you rent out their facility so that your guests have exclusive use of the facility during your party. This can be a fun option if you want built in entertainment. For example, you can rent out a family entertainment center to have your guests play mini golf, ride go-karts, and play amusement games.


Many facilities also have rooms you can rent out for a smaller fee. This is a great option if you want your party at a restaurant or entertainment center, but don’t want to pay to have the place exclusively for your party.

, Many communities have room rentals at community centers, libraries, or parks. Most of the time you can rent these rooms for much less money than you can at other places, and you typically get the room for a much longer period of time.


If you’re a member of, or know someone who’s a member of, a country club, check to see if you can rent the clubhouse out for your party.
Many neighborhoods have a clubhouse at their pool that is available for rental to the neighbors. Check around to see if you know someone who lives in a neighborhood with a clubhouse who will let you rent it for your party.

, Most parties for teenagers include some sort of music to dance and listen to. For a big party, you’ll want to have a DJ to keep the music going throughout the entire party. Ask around for recommendations for a good local DJ, or search online for reviews.If you want to save some money, you can do your own music by making a long playlist, or several playlists of fun songs. You can rent a sound system from a party rental company, or just play your music on your own player.

, You will definitely want someone taking pictures of your epic party for you to cherish in the years to come. Most likely, you will be too busy enjoying your party to think about taking pictures. Many photographers are available for hire, and they typically charge per hour.


To save money you could ask a friend or family member if they could be in charge of taking pictures for the party. To be nice, you could get them a small thank you gift for giving their time to help you.
Another fun way to get pictures of your party is to ask all of the guests to take pictures and then upload them to social media using the same hashtag. For example, you can have a sign saying, “Have fun and take lots of pics! Then share them using #Beccas16.”

, Having a caterer prepare and set up the food can be an easy way to make sure your guests are well fed at your party. You can contract with a catering company to prepare, set up, and serve your food during the party, or you can just have a restaurant cater the food by preparing large party trays that you pick up and set out yourself.


Many grocery stores also make party trays of food.
Don’t forget about the cake. Many catering companies don’t do cakes, so you might have to get one specially made from a bakery.

, At the beginning of your party timeline, you should have 10 to 15 minutes allotted for guests to arrive. This way anyone who is running late doesn’t miss any of the activities.

, Make sure you plan in enough time for each activity you plan to do at your party. If you want people to have time to dance, plan in dancing/socializing time. If you are going to play a game, make sure you allow enough time to give the instructions, play the game, and relax a bit after the game.If you’ve hired a DJ, you can have him announce when it’s time for an activity like a game.

, An important part of the timeline is to plan out a time for guests to eat. You might have a buffet set up for guests to snack on throughout the party, but you will still want a special time for guests to stop and sing happy birthday to you while you blow out your candles. This gives guests time to enjoy the birthday cake.

, You will want another 10 to 15 minutes to wrap up the party and give guests time to gather their belongings before leaving. This is the time that the music will start to get softer, triggering that the party is wrapping up.


Don’t forget to thank your party guests as they leave. It’s a great idea to have a small parting present to give each guest as a thank you for attending your party.

, You can buy paper invitations from card and party stores for an easy way to get invitations. They typically will have invitations matching many themes, but you can also get plain invitations there as well. You should buy more invitations than the amount of guests you plan to invite so you have extras in case you mess up writing the information on one., Another way to invite guests to a party is through social media, email, or an online invitation company. Many social media sites let you create an event and then invite friends to it right on their site. You can also use an online invitation company to send an email invitation to your guests. Most of these companies allow you to see if the person has read the invitation, and gives the person an easy way to R.S.V.P.


Inviting guests online is a bit more informal, but is an acceptable option in today’s tech driven world.

, One way to make sure your invitations are unique is to make them yourself. You can buy cardstock or heavy weight paper from a craft store to design your own invitations on. This is one way to easily get your invitation to match the theme of the party.


Be creative and use your imagination to create an invitation that fit’s your party.
Search online to find ideas for homemade invitations.
Make sure you buy envelopes that are big enough to fit your invitations.

If you know someone who plays guitar, ask them to bring their guitar so they can play songs around the fire.

Get a cool fuzzy rug to put on the floor.,
Get a desk!,
Get a bulletin board!,
Add music!,
Spice up your room with random do-dads.,
Put pictures in your room!,
Make your own stuff!",How to Make Your Room a Hangout Spot (Teen Girls)," All good rooms have a theme- it ties the room together. There are so many different possibilities when it comes to themes, so you're sure to find one that you like. Some ideas for themes are:


Retro
Plaid
Your favorite color
Your favorite band
Paris (or another city)
Japan (or another country)
Music
Your favorite movie (Harry Potter, etc.)
Animals
Your favorite book (Percy Jackson, etc.)

If you don't like these themes, think up your own. Be creative and make it something that you love! After all, it is your room. Make it lazy capable. Make it into the room of your dreams!

;
, If you like the colour that your room is right now, keep it. If not, paint it! If your room theme is a colour, paint your room that colour. If your room theme is Paris, for example, paint a mural on your wall of the Eiffel tower (or hire a pro to do it for you). You could also use wallpaper on your walls, but it can be really hard to remove.

, Try to make this match your theme. If you have a plaid theme, buy a plaid bedspread. If your theme is Justin Bieber, buy a bedspread with his face on it. You may not be able to find the bedspread that you want, but be creative. Not everything in your room has to fit with your room exactly. Just make sure that the colour of your bedspread complements the other colours of your room.

, These are super cool and really make your room look comfortable and cool. Pile toss pillows on your bed to add to the cozy atmosphere. Get some that match the theme of your room, or some that are in your favorite colors or shapes! This will make your bed really cozy and cool!

, This way, your friends can flop down into a chair rather than crisscross applesauce on the floor! Put a toss pillow or two on your chairs to make them seem comfier!

, Buy a lamp or two so that you have some light in your room. Buy some cool lampshades that complement the colours/theme of your room. You can also hang some white fairy lights around your room if you want to add a glamorous touch, or hang up some lanterns for a modern look.

, Get ones in your favorite colours. You can buy a couple different ones and put them in different spots in your room!

, Since you're a teenager, you're going to need a place to do homework on, so get yourself a desk. Desks can actually be a decoration of its own! Frame pictures of you and your friends/family/boyfriend, etc. and put them on your desk. Buy a jewelry holder and display your earrings on your desk. Put some candles on your desk too. Use it to display your mementos, trophies, pens...basically anything you want.

, This is a great way to add personality to your room. Display it on your wall and create a collage to go with your theme. Add photos, posters, drawings, pictures, anything you want! These are also really great as you can pin stuff up without damaging your wall.

, Got an iPod or MP3 player? Turn it up and crank up the tunes! Or bring out your CD player and find a place to display your CD collection!

, Scarves and feather boas are great for framing a mirror, bulletin board, or photo. Beaded curtains can be put in doorways, and can also make cool curtains on your window! Be creative, but don't go too crazy and clutter up your room.

, Another good idea is to hang up artwork in your room. If you want something modern and cool, hang up some pop-art. If you want something soft and classy, hang up a picture of a flower.

, See something that you like in a magazine that is too expensive? Try to create it yourself. Make picture frames, lampshades, bulletin boards, blankets, etc. This way it is you, and it matches your room.

Finally, have a fantastic time!",How to Pack for a Sleepover (Teens)," Make sure it has pockets for storing smaller items in and at least one larger compartment for bigger essential items. Ensure that the bag you have picked is comfortable to carry and can fit everything in perfectly well.;
, Inside pack: deodorant, body spray, perfume, toothbrush/paste, makeup, pads/tampons, shampoo, shower gel (if you are planning on having a shower at the friends' house). hair ties, bobby pins, face wash and anything else you wish to bring (put all leakable items in zip-lock bags or plastic baggies to prevent leakages).

, If your PJ's/sleepwear have short sleeves, bring along another jumper in which you are happy to sleep in (you never know how cold the room may be!). Another choice would be to pack an onesie!

, You can't forget snacks and junk food on a sleepover - popular choices include chocolate, sweets, biscuits (Oreos work best), crisps (salt and vinegar are more gentle on the stomach late at night so are a recommended choice) and you can't forget drinks - perhaps some Lucozade, lemonade, Sprite or Fanta?

, Although your friend's parents are virtually guaranteed to have medical supplies in their house, you can of course bring your own! Include: plasters, painkillers (paracetamol preferably), extra pads/tampons, insect bite medicine, an inhaler (if needed), antiseptic wipes, sudocrem, spot/acne cream and any other desired supplies.

, You never know if you will wake up during the night and want to read for a little bit.

, This is a must! What if you need to go to the bathroom during the night and it is dark?!

, It's only polite to wear them in the morning when you are going down to breakfast or eating dinner the night before.

, Best chances are at your house or a friends house. Choose somewhere with sufficient space for lots of rowdy teenagers.

, Go to a party store and buy the following:

, Use new and old music so it's a fun mix.

, Pick a date, time, and place. Since this is going to be a night to remember, don't make the invitations tacky!

, That way they won't have much to complain about when it does come around. Be respectful of their privacy and life.

, Crank up the music while you decorate.

, Inflate balloons with helium and leave some with just air so they stay on the ground too. Hang streamers in a visually pleasing way, nobody likes bad decorations. Plug in (or put batteries) into your light of choice. Test it to make sure it works. Put pink sheets over the couches and throw crazy throw pillows on the floor and furniture.

, That way people get a real taste of the 80's.

, Have vintage Polaroids or old cameras (make sure you have disposable too!) laying around to take pictures of the party.

, Have punch in a bowl, or even better, a cooler with a dispenser. Be careful not to have alcohol in any visible or obvious place. Have food like cotton candy, candy, chips, a chocolate fountain, and wings or pizza. Set the dry food out first and then add the hot or cold food right before the party.

, Ask for their invitation or ask if they have any alcohol. The last thing you want is an uninvited guest to ruin the night.

, This is YOUR night, make it amazing!

Be prepared for guests to arrive.",How to Plan a Party (for Tweens)," What kind of party do you want to have? A classic choice for a tween party is a sleepover, but you may want to stick to the typical party that's only a few hours long, or a pool party. Take into account any themes you may want to have, too; for example, a party in late October may be a good candidate for a Halloween or costume party, or you could plan a theme unrelated to the time of year, such as a sports party.

You'll also need to take into account what adult will be supervising the party; many parents will not let their child attend a party if there's no adult supervising. A parent supervising the party is probably the best choice, as siblings over 18 may not pay enough attention.;
, Chances are, now that you're older, you can have more people at your party than you used to. Invite friends that you have, and consider asking them if they have any friends they want to invite, too.


Set a limit on how many ""friends of friends"" can be invited - too many people can pave the road for a lot of drama, and it's much harder to host a party with a lot of people. Consider limiting the amount to one ""friend of a friend"" per person, or just not allow it at all.

, Even if you are allowed to have parties on school nights, don't! Most parents won't let their kids out on school nights, so make it a Friday or Saturday night. Make the party at a time that suits your family. Pick a time for the party to start, as well, but make sure it gives the attendees time to get ready - you don't want to have the party immediately after school.

Plan an ending time, too. You'll want a time for your guests to be picked up from the party so that everyone isn't sitting around, awkwardly waiting for their parents.

, Depending on where the party is, you may have to make different considerations as to certain aspects of your party. For example, public places often need to be booked before having a party there, and some may have restrictions on things such as the amount of people or what can be brought to the place.

If you want to have your party outside, consider having a backup plan if there is bad weather or problems with bugs.

, Parties usually don't go as well as you might want if people are just left to sit and talk. Consider activities that fit the theme of the party; a sleepover may be a good place for a movie, a beach party would be a great place for a game of volleyball, and an outdoor party would be a nice place for using a rock-climbing wall or playing a game of frisbee.

Make sure the activities make sense for the age group. At age eleven, a game of Pin the Tail on the Donkey doesn't make sense for the vast majority of parties.
Consider backup activities, too, in case people don't like a suggested activity or an activity takes less time than anticipated.

, Pizza is a classic party staple, but you'll need something other than a main course, and you may want to have a different type of ""meal food"", too. Consider snacks such as chips, candies, or even fondue fountains; when it comes to drinks, consider soft drinks like sodas, lemonade, or fruit punch (but never bring in alcohol!).

If you're having a sleepover, you'll need to consider what will be done for breakfast, too. Eating leftover chips or candy for breakfast probably isn't the best choice. Consider things like bagels or pancakes that can be easily made or bought.

Always take food allergies into account! You do not want a party to be ruined because somebody had an allergic reaction and had to go to the hospital. If you plan on serving food that has a common allergen (e.g. peanuts), make sure that the guests will have some way of knowing about the allergen (for example, putting a note underneath a food with nuts in it saying ""contains nuts"").

, You can make them on the computer or buy them. If you make them, give them a special twist. For example, for a pirate-themed party, you could put them in the microwave to make them look dirty and old, or make the invitations look like a treasure chest with a flap for the lid to the chest. Include the following information on the invitation:


Your name
The time and date of the party
The location of the party, including an address
The theme of the party (e.g. pool party, costume party, sleepover)
Contact information to RSVP
What to bring, if applicable (e.g. presents, sleeping bags)

, You want the guests to have time to RVSP. A good window of time is two weeks before the party, which gives people enough time to plan ahead and buy or put together anything that they may need.


Hand out invitations in person; texting them or distributing invitations via social media can be cause for trouble among those who didn't get invited, especially if you're a popular student.

, After everyone has responded to the RSVP, buy your supplies and decorations. Get whatever you need for the party, its activities, and so on. Be sure to buy enough for every person, and maybe even a bit extra if you anticipate it being needed.


Buy an extra of something important, in case somebody forgets to bring one; for example, if you're doing a craft project that asks for people to bring plastic jars, buy a plastic jar in case someone doesn't have one at the party.
Be sure to get plastic plates and cups, too. You don't want to realize you don't have anything for your guests to use for their food!

, A few days before the party, purchase any packaged foods and store them for the party. Make sure to buy drinks, too; make a list of the foods and drinks you need, and check them off your list as you go. If, during the party, you'll be making a recipe, make sure to get enough of the ingredients, too!


If the meal you want to serve is something like pizza or takeout, order it during the party, not before. It'll get cold otherwise, and cold food isn't good food in the eyes of a party meal.

, On the day of the party, do what you need to do to decorate. Hang up wall or ceiling decorations, put out supplies for any activities you plan to do, and so forth. Make sure everything is fully prepared; you don't want to be rushing to bring out decorations or activities!


Some public party areas will decorate the area for you, but others won't. It varies from place to place. If you do have to decorate the area yourself, make a game out of doing it! And remember, if you can't reach something, get help from an adult.

, The day of the party, get ready for guests to arrive; greet them as they arrive so that it's more personal. Ease them into any activities that are already available, such as multiplayer video games. Be friendly, so that your guests are ready to have a fun party - and that everyone, you included, can have fun!"

When girls cry because nobody has asked them to dance, don't let it ruin your night.",How to Prepare for a School Dance (for Girls)," School dances can be fun and memorable, but not everybody likes dancing in front of a lot of people.;
, You've decided you're going to the dance. If you need a ticket, buy one. Some schools also require you to show them your i.d. at the entrance.

, You can go with a date if you want, but it's pretty normal to go with a group of friends. But if nobody will go with you, you will most likely see people there from school that you know and can hang out with.

, Depending on how much you're going to dance, you're going to get sweaty, so wear a tank top. The first dance I went to was a Halloween dance in middle school, and I wore a costume and my makeup started literally running off my face, leaving a trail of red and blue. The point is, you're going to get sweaty. If it's a formal dance, like prom or homecoming, you should wear a skirt or a dress. But if it's a casual dance, then a skirt and a pretty top or jeans and a fancy top is fine. It depends on your dancing style, but for a casual dance you should not wear high heels. The best shoes you can wear to a casual dance are cute flats or converse.

, If the dance is today, don't worry, you can find out in a few hours, but if it's in the future, it will be smart to start now. Find some music that will probably be found in a dance and listen to it. Examples of music found in a school dance:


Poker face by Lady Gaga
Every time we touch by Cascada
Down by Jay Sean
Meet me Halfway by the Black Eyed Peas
Low by Flo-Rida
And other fast music like that.

, If you're still worried, just do whatever everyone else is doing. HAVE FUN! make up your own moves, be funky!

, If a bunch of your friends don't want to stay, suggest that you all go out for ice cream or hang out in the parking lot or the food court.

, If one of them is your friend and you feel bad for them, explain to your date that you want to spend a song with her and dance with your friends. If he says it's not okay, suggest that he go grab a soda.

Give yourself preparation time.,
GO!","How to Prepare for a Dance, Homecoming, or Party"," Know whether or not the host knows you are planning to attend. In some cases, you may have to receive a formal invite to be allowed in or considered a guest. In others, like for dances or casual parties, word may get around and there may be no strict guest list. If you attend school, figure out if your grade is allowed to attend, and if it's a part at someone's house, find out if it's a set guest list or the type of bash where anyone who's heard about it is welcome to come.;
, You'll want to know in advance where, when, and why and event is taking place. The first two questions are obvious, but the second is just as important- you don't want to show up at a birthday bash, baby shower, etc. empty handed, do you? Even dances can have a specific purpose- often they are run as charity events and to raise money. Make sure to find these things out, as well as who or what establishment is hosting the get together, whether or not there will be a fee to get in, who is attending, and what the guests are expected to wear or bring.

, Depending on your age, you may or may not be able to drive yourself. If the place is in walking distance from your house, even better! If you can't get yourself there on your own, look to a parent or older sibling for a ride. If none can be provided, look towards a friend you know is attending for a ride. Public transportation is another option. However, even more important than getting there is getting home! If the person driving you there can't drive you back, or something else hinders your ability to get back the way you came, try to find another way home. Another good idea is to have a back up plan- someone to call or a way to get home if your planned route back gets scrambled. This is especially important if there will be alcohol at the party, as you should never drink and drive or get into a car with a driver who has drunken.

, If you're a girl, this is probably of more importance to you, but don't worry, guys, there's some stuff here you should know, too! Start by finding out the formality of this event. If you're at a loss, ask your friends or other attendees what they think and what they will be wearing. When in doubt, dress up a little, because it's easier to tone your look down if it's too formal than to go the other way around. For girls, a nice skirt, pair of slacks, or even jeans can be acceptable, depending on the formality of the event. A dress can also be acceptable, and can be made less formal with leggings and a shirt underneath. A polo shirt, blouse, cardigan, or t shirt are good choices for tops, and play with fun accessories. For your hair, go with something low-fuss, as you don't want to be fumbling with it the whole time. A nice up-do or half-up, half-down hairstyle is pretty and easy. Makeup can be fun to play with, too, but take the event into consideration. For a beach wedding, for example, keep it low key. For shoes, ballet flats can go formal or casual. Sandals and boots are another idea. For guys, jeans or slacks and a button down is universally flattering. A nice blazer is also an option. T shirts and hoodies are fine for casual events. Sneakers or dressy shoes are options for footwear. Remember to check the weather!

, Decide on your outfit ahead of time. Begin to get ready an hour before you plan to leave. Shower- it'll keep you feeling cleaner longer. Make sure that everything is arranged ahead of time, and that you have extra money with you, as well as your charged cell phone. Be sure to have your driver's license, any id, directions, and maps on hand as well.

, Have fun. Try not to over-think things or worry too much. If you plan ahead of time, you'll not only be averting disaster, but you'll be prepared if one occurs. So, enjoy yourself!

, After you dry off and semi-dry your hair, slip into your outfit. Pull it up from your feet if you can. That way your wet hair doesn't make your dress wet too.

, If you are going to be using any type of hair product, throw an old, large pajama top over yourself. To add more volume, flip your hair over and completely dry your roots first. Then fling your head back like those models in the hair product commercials, then finish drying and styling.

Get class officers involved. This is an easy way to help ensure all classes have an even voice in the decision-making process.
Recruit from outside student government. If your organization allows, recruit from students across campus who are looking to get involved with leadership activities.
Partner with other organizations such as pep groups or student leadership groups. This offers you more support from the student body as well as potential volunteers.;
, As the dance planning progresses this list may grow, but it will help your team to stay on task. Begin with:


Date
Theme
Location
Decorations
DJ
Photographer
Refreshments
Chaperons
Budget
Faculty Adviser

, Once you have your volunteers, it's important to make sure they all know what jobs need to be done. Put certain people in charge of certain matters, and delegate what needs to be done to the right person.Some jobs, such as picking an adviser and a theme, should be done as a team. Others, such as getting quotes from venues and photographers, can be handled by an individual or a small sub-committee.
Have groups to cover venue, entertainment, advertising and ticket sales, and decorating.
Check in on a regular basis with your team. Ask “Have we completed this yet?” or “How are we doing with finding a DJ?” whenever your team meets to help keep everyone on task.
Set up a check-in system so people can report their progress. Have a space where you can write out a large checklist of what needs to be done, or keep a shared calendar between your group so everyone can report on their progress.

, Like other student groups, a homecoming committee will need a faculty adviser. If one is not pre-assigned, find a teacher who you trust or who comes well-recommended by other committee members.Your adviser should be involved with your committee’s plans. Keep them up to date with everything you do by having them attend planning meetings and providing them with meeting notes.

, Parent volunteers are an important not only for monitoring students, but for helping with set up and running the dance. Get a group of parent volunteers together to help on the evening of the dance.


Check with your school to see how many chaperones they require per student. Many schools have their own guidelines, and it is important to comply with your own school’s regulations.
Work with your school’s parent-teacher association to find volunteers. Ask to attend a meeting so that you can directly present the opportunity to them and pass around a sign-up list.

, If you are hiring a DJ, getting refreshments catered, getting professional help with the decorations, or hiring a professional photographer, start gathering quotes at least one month in advance.


Ask about any surcharges or equipment fees, as well as hourly rates. Inquire about what your vendors will supply, and what you are expected to have. For example, check with your DJ to see if they provide the sound system, or if you will need to rent one from elsewhere.
Contact at least three options for every vendor to ensure that you get competitive pricing.

, Your budget will dictate much of what you can and cannot do. Talk to your student government treasurer to better understand how much money your committee has to spend on the dance.


Ask your faculty adviser to verify the budget. See if the school will contribute anything outside of the student government money.
Plan your budget to encompass everything you will need. Use the quotes you got from your vendors as well as budget plans and receipts from previous years to figure out what the dance will cost.
Do not let your budget exceed the amount you have available. Revisit your budget often to ensure you are on track.

, If your budget is not enough to cover the cost of the dance, create a fundraising plan with your committee. Explore multiple options both on and off campus.


Host bake sales on campus during lunch periods as well as before and after school.
Work with other student groups to raise money by hosting events such as a car wash. Events that let you reach out into your community give you more opportunities to bring in cash.
Ask local restaurants if they offer fundraising nights. Some restaurants may offer programs that donate a certain percent of profits for the night to a student organization. Partner with a local eatery and spread the word via flyers, emails, and social media.

, At least one month before the dance, have a theme ready. Come up with five or six theme ideas as a committee, and have a vote across campus so that students can pick their favorite.Get approval from your staff adviser for any potential themes. Getting the theme cleared early on prevents later potential disapproval.
Choose themes that fit the mood of the dance. If you want a more formal dance, an Old Hollywood theme might be more appropriate. If you want a more casual dance, something like Beach Luau may fit better.

, Whether the dance is going to be at a local hotel or in the school gym, make sure you reserve a venue as early as possible. Filing a proper room reservation with your school ensures that you get the space you need.Make a copy of the venue contract or room reservation for your own records, so that you can reference it whenever you need it.
Include all necessary facilities on your reservation. If you need the gym, the bathrooms, and the kitchen to store refreshments, make sure to list all of them.

, Get your DJ, photographer, and others booked as soon as the budget is set. Reserve any other equipment your vendors may need, such as sound systems, at this time, too.


Work with your staff adviser to make sure all of the contracts are properly drawn up and include all the information your school needs.
Keep copies of any contracts or agreements for your committee’s review.

, Before everything becomes too hectic with the rest of homecoming, make a detailed plan of how you want the day of the dance to work. Set your day-of plan a month in advance.


Have a detailed floor plan of your location and how you want to decorate.
Draw out where the DJ should go, where the ticket table is set up, where lights should be strung, and other details.
Create a plan for coat-check. Decide where coats will be stored, where the table will be set, and how you will tag coats to keep them organized. Also make sure you have at least one volunteer to man the table and two to retrieve coats.
Designate someone as the day-of coordinator.This person will communicate with the volunteers on the night of the dance and troubleshoot any problems that might come up.

, Get all the supplies you need for decorating two to three weeks in advance. That way, you have plenty of time to find alternatives for something if you cannot find it locally. Shop for food the day of or the day before so that nothing goes bad.


Check with local stores to see if they are willing to donate certain items or offer a discount to the school.
Put larger items or perishable items on hold. Talk to your local market about reserving food trays in advance and picking them up the day of the dance. Do the same for larger decorative items that you might not be able to store easily on campus.

, Start selling tickets at least two weeks before the actual dance. Compliment sales with advertisements in the school announcements, as well as banners and posters across campus.


Announce sales dates and ticket prices in advance in your school paper, during your school announcements, and on your school’s website as well as social media.
Set up a table to sell before and after school for a half-hour to an hour, as well as during lunch periods.
Create a volunteer schedule to make sure the table is staffed during all sales times. Work with your treasurer to get other volunteers, if need be.
Order your cash box at least one week before you start selling tickets. Talk to your treasurer about whether the cash box will be provided by the student government association, the school administration, or from another source.

, Most schools lead up to their homecoming dance with a homecoming spirit week. Spirit weeks often involve many events, so make sure you know who and what will be available to you.


Talk with your staff adviser about equipment such as tables and chairs. Make sure these are ready for you at least a few hours before the dance so that you can set up.
Talk with school administration to make sure your vendors have designated areas to park, unload, and set up. Remember, those with heavy equipment will need to be close to the venue.
Create a plan for the day of the dance. Work with your committee and any additional volunteers to assign duties such as setting up chairs and decorating. Make sure everyone knows their job well in advance.

, Give yourself and your volunteers at least six hours to set up the dance. Get decorations set up as much as possible before your vendors arrive.


Have the DJ, photographer, and chaperons arrive early. Show the DJ the area where they will be working, and give the photographer a tour of the space.
Delegate duties to the chaperons such as helping with coat check, monitoring the dance floor, or helping with crowd control. Show them where they need to be and put them in touch with the day-of coordinator.

, Make sure you and all of your volunteers have some time to enjoy the dance, as well. Build breaks into your volunteers’ schedules so that everyone has some time to have fun.


For example, let a ticket-taker relieve your day-of coordinator for a while once everyone is in, or get a chaperone to stand in on coat-check while the coat attendants go dance.
Your volunteers are students, as well. Give them time to enjoy their efforts.

, As soon as the dance is over, start taking down decorations and cleaning. Find out what your school’s facilities services will take care of, and plan to do the rest with your volunteers.


Facilities services often cover things like vacuuming, mopping, and bathroom cleaning. Decorations, tables, chairs, and equipment are often the homecoming committee’s responsibility.
Bring extra cleaning supplies such as paper towels, trash bags, sponges, and cleaning solution. This will help take care of any smaller marks or scuffs around the venue.
Make sure all trash gets to a designated trash area. Ask your school if you need to schedule a dumpster drop-off and pick-up for event clean-up.

Make sure you know when you've found the perfect dress.,
Accessorize to perfection.,
Complete your look with the perfect hair and makeup.",How to Select the Perfect Homecoming Dress," Ideally, a homecoming dress should fall at or just above the knee. Full-length gowns, while appropriate for prom, are a classic homecoming faux pas. Homecoming dresses tend towards tighter, more sleek silhouettes and cuts that allow for comfortable dancing and movement. However, a bit of tulle or ruffles is perfectly permissible as well. Straps or some form of support are recommended, and if a dress is strapless, be sure that it fits impeccably. While the dress's length and cut should be fun and sleek, remember that you won't want to be worrying about your dress when you're on the dance floor!;
, While homecoming is fun and casual, it is also traditionally in late autumn. Bright colors, tie-dye patterns, or summery florals are not the components of a perfect homecoming dress. Dark colors, whites, ivories, metallic tones, or blacks are good colors for a solid homecoming dress. As for prints, animal prints are always a fun option, or a dark, elegant brocade can also be stunning with a youthful cut. Also, fabrics with a sheen to them are a staple of homecoming attire.

, While all-over sequins may jump off of a magazine page, they might not be the best choice for a homecoming dress. If your school has a strict dress code (i.e., no sleeveless dresses) make sure that you have a shawl or shrug to cover your shoulders. Also, be sure to pair your dress with a chic coat, because chances are the night is going to be chilly. Lastly, keep the term ""semi-formal"" in mind. Dresses with too many runway ruffles, or other cumbersome forms of ornamentation, are not the best choice for homecoming.

, Your homecoming dress should reflect your day-to-day style and personality. Are you outgoing, brash, and flirtatious? Your perfect dress may be Animal Print, or a dazzling one-shoulder silhouette. Do you normally dress classically, with an elegant touch? A dark, shimmering brocade or floral with a sweetheart neckline and a clean hem may be your perfect dress. Are you quirky, fun and creative? Maybe some tulle, ruffles, or bows will make an appearance on your perfect dress. The girls who really stun at homecoming are the ones that can take their personal style and reflect it in the limited colors, fabrics, and cuts of a homecoming dress.

, It may take a few months to chance upon that perfect homecoming dress, so make sure you start early! An early start means that more dresses will be in stock, the stores will be less crowded, and if a store doesn't have your size in stock they can ship it in time for homecoming

, Your dress should make you feel fun without overpowering your natural beauty. It should fit very well and flatter your body type, and be secure enough to stay steady after an hour of dancing. You should feel special in your homecoming dress, and be able to walk into your school confidently and ready for fun.

, Once you have the perfect dress, try to find pieces that make it even better. If your neckline is open, maybe a statement necklace will add punch to your look, or perhaps a shimmering bracelet will add some needed sparkle. When selecting shoes, keep comfort in mind, While at many schools, heels are taken off to ease dancing in about an hour, it's still a good idea to pick a low or medium heel (i.e., anything above 2 1/2 inches is pushing it.)

, Generally, homecoming hairstyles have some hair down and some up, with gratuitous curls. However, a sleek, effortless ponytail or free-flowing waves can work wonders with certain dresses. Flip through prom magazines or photos of your school's homecoming for hairstyle ideas. Makeup should be fun, but also light and durable. A solid foundation and a glossy lip with some shimmering eye shadow, light eyeliner, and your best mascara should do the trick.

",How to Prepare for a Junior High School Formal," Look around and get something that you honestly like and you are comfortable in (don't get a strapless dress to impress your friends if you are uncomfortable in it). Look on the internet but be sure to search on trustworthy websites such as JCPenney's, Macy's, and Lulu's. Windsor has amazing formal dresses also!;
, Now that you have the dress that you are happy with, you need shoes and accessories. Shoes are a must have and they can make or break your ensemble. Practice walking around in your shoes at home (especially if you plan to wear heels) so you can really work them the night of the formal! Choose wisely and go with something that you know will work. Accessories pull together the outfit and make it look like you're put together. If you are planning on buying new jewelry just for formal, DO NOT buy something expensive (you will only be wearing it for a few hours!). If you do buy new jewelry go somewhere like Claire's or Icing's because they sell nice looking jewelry at a very reasonable price. Dangle earrings are a nice choice along with a corresponding necklace. DO NOT overdo it with jewelry! Keep it subtle, not gaudy.

, You have two choices: a salon or beauty parlor, or doing it at your house. Whatever you choose, DO NOT overdo it. Keep it subtle, remember that you are still young! A natural look is the best way to showcase your real beauty.

, For fancy updos, you can go to a hair stylist, or you can do the hairstyles at home with the help of your relatives. If you're not sure about what hairstyle to try, look through magazines like Seventeen and search the Internet.

, You can either get them at a salon, DIY, or buy the realistic stick on or glue on nails. For a simple look, french tips are a classic. For a more fun look, try a bold, bright color!

, If you get a spray tan, get a light natural glowing shade. Don't make yourself turn out orange!

, Avoid strong or musky fragrances.

, It's also a good idea to carry mints.

As soon as school starts, keep your eyes open for cute boys that could potentially be your date to the dance. Once you find your perfect match, flirt a little and drop hints that your interested. If you think he likes you but can't tell for sure, ask one of your girlfriends to talk to him and find out what he thinks of you. Or tell your friends to tell him that you and he would make a cute couple.;
,


This is going to be the most important night of the year when it's your time to get all dolled up and shine. So make the most of it and always remember, be confident because it will make you irresistible!

,


Go with your friends to search for possible dresses to wear. Remember to keep in mind your shape, size, skin tone, hair color, and type of dress that flatters your body type most. Then go back to the store and look one final time with a parent or friend before you purchase your final dress.

,


Get a manicure and pedicure that will look good with your dress.

,,


Make sure to exfoliate, shave thoroughly, and wash your hair.

,


Be sure to wear loose clothing to and from the tanning salon. Do not get wet for at least 8 hours after spray tanning. Do not shave again before dance or else the tan will get blotchy, streaky, fade, or come off in some areas.

,


If you're going to do a fancier hairstyle, take it to the salon. Make sure you get an appointment scheduled way in advance so that you will for sure get a spot because, as homecoming dates arrive, openings are less common and harder to find. If you are going for a certain look, bring in a picture of your ideal hairstyle.

,


That's the flower that you pin to the guys coat. Make sure you don't forget this because it is very important! The guy buys the girl a corsage. The boutonniere and corsage should match the girl's dress. Also make sure that your date's tie matches the color of your dress!

, Don't leave your house without snapping a few shots with just the two of you. You should have an area either in your living room or in front of your house nicely decorated & cleaned for a background. Also it is a good idea to have Hors d'oeuvres available for your date when he comes to pick you up. If you are going to someone else's house for group pictures, make sure you bring a tray of fancy snacks and a thank you note in order to be as polite as possible.

,


It's a good idea to google some of the common dances such as: The Cha Cha Slide, Soulja Boy, Electric Slide etc.. so you don't look awkward when everyone is dancing in sync and you're just standing there watching or badly attempting to follow everybody else's moves. It's extremely hard to learn on the spot.

,,


Homecoming will be a treasured memory that you will someday be able to share with your kids and brag about how awesome you looked with your date, so have a good time! Don't forget to take pictures- memories are forever.

Remember, there will always be other discos and parties so if you can't decide over what top or jeans to wear, then you can simply save one pair for another time.

",How to Get Ready for a Semiformal," You'll probably want to get it at least a week or two before the dance. If you are going with a date, you can coordinate the colors. Here are some ideas:


Top: A fancy blouse that compliments your skirt is excellent and looks great!
Skirt: Don’t get a skirt that is too short, as this is a semi-formal. Instead, get something knee-length or longer.
Dress: You can get a dress instead of a skirt too. Since it's a semi-formal, look for something about knee length. Don't go for sparkly, glitzy, or super short dresses. Buy what fits and suits you.
Shoes: They don't have to match your dress, but should be a complementing color. Semi-tall heels work well with knee-length dresses. Make sure you can walk in them!(Ballroom dance shoes are elegant & comfy);
, Use a good smelling body wash. Shampoo and condition your hair. Shave if you can,

,,, Paint them, or at least file them. Shimmery, light colors work well.

,, Sometimes it can be better to go to a stylist who knows what they're doing. But if you have to do it yourself. You want something that isn't so loose it will fall out when you dance; you want something pretty. Halter dresses look pretty good with any hairstyle. Strapless dresses look good with up-dos. Strap dresses look good with anything. If you have straight hair, try smoothing and shining it and wearing it down. Or, put it in a sleek high ponytail. If you have wavy hair, try wearing down and a little bit messy; feel free to add a headband, put it in chic messy bun, or even try on a messy side ponytail.

, You don't want to stain your dress with toothpaste!

,, Go glam for nighttime. Green eyes: try lavender, purple, or light gray shadow. Make a smokey eye. Put on some mascara and curl lashes. Put on some shimmer cream as blush and some shimmery lip gloss. Brown eyes: try a green or purple shadow. Blue eyes: try a brownish or coral shadow. If you go heavy on eyes, don't go heavy on lips.

, A pretty pocketbook or clutch is fine. Include: bottle of water, mascara, lip gloss, breath mints or gum, cell phone, floss, body spray, hairbrush and pins, and money.

They'll remember you as the beautiful girl or the handsome guy standing in the corner or tearing it up on the dance floor. It can leave that lasting impression, and a good impression at that.;
, Check out a friend's closet a couple nights before or if you can go through your mom's or dad's closet. You never know you might just find something adorable and you know nobody else will have it!


A sibling might have an outfit or accessories that you can borrow.

, Find a balance that reflects who you are and the current fashion statements.


Avoid spending too much. This is one night and you've many other expenses yet in life.

, Stylish girls wear dresses. Buy the dress that you think fits you well and expresses your personality best. Choose a color that suits you, not just because it's this season's color.

, Choose nicely tailored, good quality clothes that are comfortable for moving in. And choose them in colors that match your appearance and are colors you like.

, The shoes should match the dress or pant/top set. That is, unless you'd like to mix up your outfit into a rainbow of colors! Choose shoes that you feel comfortable in when dancing. Flip-flops? Sneakers? High heels? Focus on comfort as well as style.

, Accessories can add that special something to an outfit, as well as making it look more stylish. Make sure that you like these accessories. Mix and match red, blue, and purple, or stick with yellow. Whatever you like, just go for it. You'll feel confident wearing something you like and you picked out.

, Avoid contrasting colours, as it is vital t harmonize.


For jewelry: Bracelets, earrings, necklaces and maybe a ring.

Something to carry your stuff in: Whether it's just money and a phone or a whole wad of makeup, a little bag is a useful idea for many people. If you hate the idea of carrying anything though, use a slim wallet or tuck some cash inside your lingerie (or have a friend carry your stuff).

,


An hour before the dance, do your hair - there are all sorts of styles out there for you to try. You could even sift through a magazine for ideas. Then, glam it up with sparkly hair twists and a light spritz of hairspray will keep it all in place.

, Apply make-up if you use it. If you do like makeup, apply your favorite products. This can include: A primer underneath your makeup to help it last longer, especially if you're going to be dancing and exerting yourself. Mascara, eyeliner, and eyeshadow to make your eyes pop. Lipstick and lip gloss to give color and shine to your lips. Foundation and concealer for blemishes and an even skin tone. Blush to give your cheeks some color.

, Don't overdo it, you want it to be subtle.

, Show off that glamorous smile and you're done!

To make a great impression at your dance, you want to arrive clean and fresh. If you haven’t washed your hair in the last couple days, be sure to give it a wash with a mild cleanser or shampoo.Keep your hair moisturized and healthy looking by applying conditioner after every time you shampoo.;
, You should do this every day to keep your skin clean and healthy. And especially if you want to put on some makeup for the dance, you'll want to start with a clean canvas to work with.

, Take off old nail polish. Trim and file your nails, and use a nail brush or pick to clean dirt out from underneath your fingernails. This is important for overall hygiene and appearance, and for your own self-confidence.


If you want to wear nail polish to the dance, now’s the time to apply it.

, Hair is an important part of an overall look, but how you wear it is totally up to you, and this should be dictated by how you're comfortable.


You can wear your hair curly (use a curling iron), straight (use a blow dryer or flat iron), natural (however your hair is), up in a ponytail, in a braid, bun, or twist, or just hanging loose and free.
Especially if you're trying to look cool for the dance, don’t be afraid to experiment with different hair styles. Try parting your hair differently, off to the side, or at a new angle, for instance. You can even get a fresh new haircut if you like.
Popular hair care products to help you style your locks include mousse, hair spray, serum and oil, and gel.

, Some people like wearing makeup while others hate it, and the choice is and always will be yours. If you do like makeup, apply your favorite products. This can include:


A primer underneath your makeup to help it last longer, especially if you're going to be dancing and exerting yourself.Mascara, eyeliner, and eyeshadow to make your eyes pop
Lipstick and lip gloss to give color and shine to your lips
Foundation and concealer for blemishes and an even skin tone
Blush to give your cheeks some color.

, The most important thing with clothes is that you wear something that’s comfortable and that makes you feel good. However, there may be dress codes you have to abide by, so look into what kind of dance it is before deciding what to wear.For a casual dance, you don’t have to wear anything special. You can wear whatever clothes you like, such as jeans and a t-shirt, slacks and a blouse, a skirt or dress, or even shorts and running shoes.
To really make an impression at a casual dance, consider wearing something that nobody else will be wearing, like a bold new fashion, or a themed outfit. For ideas about what fashions are currently in, take a look a what people around you are wearing, pick up a teen fashion magazine, or check out what the celebrities and trendsetters are wearing on TV.
Semi-formal dances will have a slightly stricter dress code, and you may have to dress up a little more (no ripped jeans, no casual shorts, etc.) Appropriate semi-formal wear includes nice pants, dresses, skirts, blouses and sweaters, button-down shirts, and shoes other than runners/sneakers.
If you're going to a formal dance, you may have to buy a new outfit, or pull out something you don’t wear very often. This could include a formal dress or a suit.

, This could include a necklace, bracelet, rings, earrings, belts, a tie, or a specific purse or bag.For shoes, wear something comfortable, since you're going to be dancing all night. If you don’t feel comfortable in heels, try a pair of sandals, ballet slippers, wedges, or flats.

, They say first impressions can last a lifetime, and walking into a dance for the first time can have a huge impact on the others there. Whether you arrive alone or with a group of people, walk in boldly with your head held high (this shows confidence) and don’t hesitate.


To avoid hesitating when you walk in, pick a spot and walk directly to it with purpose. For instance, you can walk to the drink table, to a group of people, or right to the dance floor if you're already feeling the music!
Be sure to smile a lot, as this exudes confidence.

, In the end, it doesn’t matter how you look, what you're wearing, or how your hair and makeup are styled: what matters is how you act, how you feel, and how you present yourself! You could be wearing a paper sack and be the life of the party, just like you could be a complete party pooper despite being the best dressed.

, The entire point of a dance is to be social and get to know new people, so why not take advantage of the situation? You may meet someone that you really like, such as a new friend or a romantic interest.


Being outgoing at a dance is also a great way to show others that you're confident and fun to be around, which is a very attractive quality.
If you're feeling a little nervous, hang out and talk to a group of friends for a while and give yourself time to relax.

, That is one of many people's pet peeves while they are at a dance. You should have fun at a dance, not be a drama starter and a party pooper!, One of the best ways to show your personality at a school dance is by dancing! It doesn’t really matter whether you can dance, as long as you're out on the floor moving and interacting with other people. Don’t be afraid to talk to new people outside your regular social group.


Be sure to stretch before you get to the dance so you don’t pull anything when you're working your moves.You may feel like the center of attention on the dance floor, but remember that everyone else if feeling just as self-conscious, and most people will be paying more attention to their own feet than yours.
Hiding away quietly in a corner isn’t a good way to make a positive impression, so try to force yourself out of your shell.

, Dancing is all about moving with the rhythm of the music, so you don’t have to know any special moves to get out and dance. If you don’t know any moves, just get on the dance floor and:Move your feet and legs in the time with the music
Bounce a little on your knees
Bob your head and move your shoulders and torso
Swing your arms in time with your feet
Pivot and twist on your feet a little, and shift your weight back and forth

, If you're waiting for someone special to ask you to dance, why not take the initiative instead? You may be nervous, and that’s ok, but maybe that person is waiting for you to ask!Similarly, don’t be afraid to say yes to dancing with someone you may not have considered dancing with before. You never know you two might just hit it off.

Plan a date: The nice thing about this type of party is that you don't have to plan months in advance ,but common-sense, try not to wait 'til the last minute to drop the invitations to your friends.,
.,
This party does not need a theme, however if you are picking a theme choose an exciting theme such as having all the guests dress up in costumes of the 1980s or figures from history.,
Menu: For this party create a menu.,
Think of activities: At this party, especially if you have a lot of guests, not everyone is going to be dancing so make sure you have some activities in mind or simply have some room where people can socialize.

,
Have the party: So there you have it!",How to Have a Low Budget Dance Party," #.Find a room: So your having a dance party,huh? Find a room that would get you and your friends to get their groove on. A dark spacious room works best such as a basement. Make sure the whole time everyone is dancing to leave the lights off,this promotes more dancing and less wallflowers.;
, Lights/decorations/theme: A dance party would not be the same without some lighting, think flickering lights etc. You can buy lighting without spending a fortune. Go to department stores and buy strobe lights,lava lamps,or disco balls.

,

Also, ask your friends to bring their mp3 players or CDs so that you can listen to more variety.

Make sure your family knows that you will be using the bathroom that night.,

Brush your teeth and use mouthwash, but not too much.

,

Choose your outfit.",How to Get Ready for a Middle School Dance," You don't want anyone barging in while you're in the middle of getting ready!;
, Then end with a long hot soak, complete with bath salts, loofahs, etc. If there's not enough hot water for you to use, then take a shower. Once you're done, wrap yourself up in a towel. Wait 20 minutes, then take a hot bath.

, If you're not, then you shouldn't try to shave - just go without it. Instead, do your best to hide your legs and armpits if you tend to have a lot of hair growth in those areas.


If you are wearing sandals, try to scrub your feet to get all the dead skin off.

, Use face masks, creams and scrubs. However, beware of using too many - the result is a massive break-out! You definitely don't want this to happen.


By now, you should be using a cleanser, toner, and moisturizer on your face every day to prevent pimples from breaking out on your face. If you do this loyally every day, the above isn't necessary unless if you have a few pimples on your face.
Rub extremely gently, for if you rub too hard and your skin absorbs the cream or mask too much, you will end up with a massive break-out!
Don't forget to rinse very well with lukewarm water.

,

For girls: if your hair is short, try wavy hair. If it is long, give it some bouncy curls. A cute headband or a bow would also do the trick.
If your hair is short, just leave it that way or give it a cut. If it's a bit longer then grab some hair gel and bring it to the front, or the side. It would be nice.

, Try to use a lighter brand of mouthwash, for your date/dance partner doesn't want to smell nothing but mouthwash.

, Eye shadow, eyeliner, mascara, blush, cover-up, foundation, lip gloss, etc. Be careful of over-applying, for no one wants to dance with a clown. They want to dance with the real you (see tips)!


Makeup should add a soft glow to your face, not add color. Try to make it look natural; use only a little and gently rub it in to let to blend. Also, balance your make-up. If you use a bold lipstick, keep your eye shadow weak, etc.
Be careful of the color shades you use; stick with light shades. Using the wrong colors will make you look like a rainbow threw up on your face.
Avoid using makeup to cover any pimples, as this will only worsen their condition and make them more obvious.

, You'll be near the guys, probably dancing with them too! They'll need to feel how soft your hands and arms are. Make sure to get an ample amount on your hands, legs, elbows and knees, as well as your cheeks and chin! It's important to put on face cream!

, Make sure you pack feminine items if needed, extra make-up, your cell-phone, mints/gum, and some extra lip gloss. Maybe a couple of pads and/or tampons if you're on your period.

, Don't forget deodorant!


Beware of over-spraying. You want to avoid a thick, heavy cloud following you around!

, Your outfit will depend on the type of dance.


If it's a costume dance (ex: Halloween), go with the costume theme, as there are normally theme costumes. If there isn't one, decide on a theme with or without your friends.
If it's an informal dance, that doesn't mean you should show up like you always do on a day-to-day basis. Although you may be tempted to wear a T-shirt, stick with a nice top (ex: blouse), a nice pair of pants - other than jeans - or a nice skirt, but make sure the skirt isn't too short! Don't go overboard with informal dances, as no one would expect you to come in a dress.
If it is a semi-formal dance, it is recommended that you choose a slightly dressier shirt, a nicer pair of pants (ex: dress pants) or a nicer skirt, and an appropriate accessory (ex: hair flower) with comfortable flats.
If it is a formal dance, wear a very nice shirt and skirt, or a dress that isn't too fancy with leggings. For formal dances, it is more appropriate to wear a bow and nice dress shoes than it would be for other dances.
Cute earrings are recommended for all the dances listed above.
Make sure you have shoes appropriate for dancing that are in very good condition. Sneakers that are frayed, dirty and worn out are not recommended, as they will ruin your appearance and look embarrassing!

, Lots of girls put their hair up, but truthfully, most guys like hair that's natural looking. Therefore, just pick your favorite hair style and wear it with pride! If you have your hair dyed or have streaks, be sure to get your hair done and dyed the night before. Even if you dye your hair, you may still want to go to a hair stylist and get it trimmed and brushed out, and get your hair washed with the fancy and expensive shampoos. Make sure to put gel in it when you're done.


Instead of putting your hair up in that messy bun or ponytail, add a little special touch to it for this particular night. You could add a small braid in your hair with that ponytail or bun, and even make the messy bun a neat bun for tonight. You could try a new hairstyle that suits your face (it is recommended you try wearing the new hairstyle for a week before the dance so you know whether it fits you or not), but make sure it suits the dance!

, Earrings, necklace, bracelets, anklets, etc. However, beware of going overboard with them. One or two should be fine.

, They won't let you in even if they know you, unless you have a good bribe or they're your best friend or boyfriend. Even if, you may not want to risk it.

,, Use lots of soap, being sure to focus on behind your ears, your armpits, any body hair you may have, your pubic region, your bottom, and your feet. Also be sure to wash your face. Use shower gel and soap up all over your body. Then use shampoo and conditioner. If you have a nice scent of shower gel, take a hot bath with the gel mixed into the water. Do this after the shower, you don't want to be bathing in dirty water.

, Often, guys 11 to around 13 to 15 have ""half mustaches"" that look more like you just forgot to shave or maybe haven't fully washed your face, not a look you're after, most likely. That honest truth is, most girls don't like beards and hate mustaches. Some stubble is good sometimes, but most girls love the clean shave look. Save the mustaches and beards for when you're older.

, Use aftershave if you have any, even if you didn't just shave. Use soap and water, and any acne prevention face wash.

, Girls love a guy with nice, soft skin.

,, Don't overpower people, but just put on a nice amount. A couple of spritzes should do.

, Your outfit will depend on the type of dance.


If it's a costume dance, go with the costume theme, or make one up with or without your friends.
If it's an informal dance, wear a nice graphic tee, nice jeans or pants, and nice sneakers or slips. In general, dressing out a little bit more than the dress code calls for looks good at these dances.
If it's a semi-formal dance, wear very nice black jeans or dress pants, a plaid or solid colored button up shirt. In this situation, it looks good to under-do the dress code a bit, but don't go to far.
If it's a formal dance, wear a button up shirt with tie, or even a tux, with nice dress pants and dress shoes.
Try a tuxedo with a tie, or a bow tie. Get a flower on the side of your tux or on your wrist to give to your girl once she arrives.

Respond to the person's promposal.,
Understand why you don't want to go to prom with this person.,
Find the person who asked you.,
Politely reject them.,
Wait for the reaction.",How to Tell Someone You Won't Go to Prom with Them," When you're asked to the prom by somebody, whether it's public or private, they're understandably nervous and don't want to be left hanging. Give the person a response - don't just walk away stunned or disgusted! You can just tell them ""No"", or if you're unsure about going to prom with that person, tell them, ""I have to think about it"" or ""Maybe"". Be aware, though, that if you tell them no, they may want an explanation, and ""I don't know"" would upset them; in this case, it's better to say ""Let me think about it"".;
, There are many reasons you wouldn't want to go to prom with someone, but knowing why can help you to explain why you don't want to go with them. Some reasons for not going to prom with someone may be:


You've already agreed to go with someone else.
You're not going to prom.
The person asking you has treated you poorly in the past.
You're not interested in the person who asked you.
You're going to prom alone or with friends, not a date.

, Once you're sure of the reason you don't want to go to prom with this person, find them and tell them that you want to talk about their promposal.


Don't do this in front of a bunch of this person's friends. They might get the wrong idea, making for an awkward situation later.

, Explain to the person nicely that you won't go with them. For example: ""I really appreciate that you asked me to the prom, and I know it took a lot of courage to do that, but the thing is, I'm not going to prom with a date. I'm just going with friends, and I'm not interested in going with a date. I hope you understand.""


Don't be rude when telling them. They were most likely extremely nervous to ask you, and being rude to them rather than letting them down gently will probably make them feel even worse. If you simply don't like the person and don't want to go with them, say to them, ""I don't think we're a good match for prom. I feel like if we went together, it would be uncomfortable for us, and I don't think either of us wants to be uncomfortable at prom.""

Additionally, don't lie to the person. If you just don't want to go with this certain person, don't say to them that you're not going to prom or that you don't want to go with a date. They'll almost definitely spot you at prom - with your date.


If the person who asked you isn't someone you think of romantically, make sure that they clearly understand that you do not have romantic feelings towards them. You don't want to cause a potentially awkward situation by making this person think that you do like them but just don't want to go to prom with them!

, Everybody will react to a rejection differently. Some people might get embarrassed and respond with ""okay, sorry I asked"", while others might get visibly upset. Be prepared for this person's reaction.


If the person starts to cry, feel free to apologize to them, but don't agree to go to prom with them just because they're crying. You made the decision to not go with them; backing out of that decision will just make you seem unreliable and a target for manipulation.
Don't ever let someone threaten you into going to prom with them. If somebody threatens to hurt you in any way because you won't go to prom with them or tells you something like ""You won't have any friends after this"", stick to your answer and go to a trusted administrator or law enforcement, depending on how severe the threat was. You should never feel obligated to go anywhere with someone just to keep yourself safe.

Ask the girl.,
Consider a promposal.,
Decide if you want to go as part of a group.,
Decide on transportation.,
Rent your tux.,
Buy a corsage.,
Make dinner reservations.",How to Take a Girl to Prom1," The first step in taking a girl to the prom is also the hardest: you have to ask her to go with you. You can do this simply, by pulling her aside between classes, or more elaborately.


If you’re not crushing on anyone at the moment, consider asking a close friend to prom. You already know you’ll have a good time with her.
If you don't want to go with anyone in particular, you can also go with a big group of your single friends.;
, If you feel up to the challenge, ask a girl to the prom with an elaborate promposal. Promposals should be fun and creative, so try to find a fun and personal way to ask your date to join you.

Try covering her bed with balloons that read “I have a big question to pop…will you go to prom with me?”Make her a sign out of legos that reads, ""Lego to Prom!""Have a pizza sent to her house with writing on the box, reading ""Is this too cheesy or will you go to prom with me?""

, If you or your date have close circles of friends, you may want to team up and go to prom as a group. You may also run into a situation where you and your date disagree on which group to go with. Be a gentleman and let her choose.It ultimately doesn’t matter which group you go with. You’ll see your friends at the prom either way.
If you choose to skip the group, that’s okay too. It just means you and your date will have more time alone.

, Depending on who you're going to prom with, you may want to take a limo. You may also want to skip the limo and take separate cars. Talk it over with your date and your group and decide what works best for your vision and your prom budget.If you need to accommodate a large number of people, school buses and party buses are also great options.
Pick a point person to collect all the money and make all the arrangements. Make sure you get them your money on time.

, Most proms are black tie, which means renting a tux is a necessity. Talk with your date and find out what kind of dress she’s planning to wear. Then look for a tux that goes with that theme.It’s not necessary to match your vest and tie to your date’s dress. You’re better off going with a neutral color, like navy blue or black.
Rent your tux early. There are only so many rental places and they run out quickly.
Remember to pick your tux up on the correct day and return it the day after the prom.

, The corsage is a small arrangement of flowers you’ll give to your date to wear on her wrist or dress. The arrangement should match her dress, so ask your date to give you a color swatch of what she plans to wear. Bring that swatch to the florist when you go to buy your corsage.Florists get incredibly busy around prom, so order your corsage at least two weeks prior to prom.
For bonus points, ask your date if there’s a style of corsage she likes. Ask her to send you a picture, then give that picture to the florist to use as inspiration.

, Some proms include dinner as part of the experience, but some don’t. If your prom doesn’t, plan to make dinner reservations for your group. Figure out how many people will be attending, then look for a restaurant that can accommodate your party.Generally, the good restaurants fill up fast, so try to make your reservations at least three weeks before prom.
The restaurant you choose should be nice (not a chain restaurant) and something everyone can enjoy. A steakhouse or Italian restaurant is usually a good bet.

Get a haircut.,
Dress for prom.,
Pick up your date.,
Take your pre-prom pictures.",How to Take a Girl to Prom2," Girls spend the days before prom pampering themselves and you should do the same. Make an appointment for you and your friends to get your hair cut at your local barber.You might also spring for a straight razor shave if you feel like you need it.
Make your hair appointment for the morning of your prom.

, Plan to spend an hour getting yourself prom appropriate. Take a shower, brush your teeth, comb your hair and put on your tuxedo. Put on your tuxedo in the following order: tuxedo shirt (followed by cufflinks and studs), pants, shoes, vest, cummerbund, bowtie and jacket.If you have additional accessories, like suspenders, don't forget to put those on as well.
Ask your mom or dad to help you tie your bowtie.
Make sure you have everything you need: check for tickets, the corsage, cash and mints.
If you’re going to an after-prom party, you may also want to bring clothes to change into.

, Arrive on time (and in a clean car)! Expect that your date will still be preparing, so take some time to make small talk with her parents. When your date walks in, compliment her, then slip the corsage on her wrist.Make sure you pose for any pictures your date's parents want.
Thank her parents before leaving and make sure you're clear on what time your date is supposed to be back home.

, Pictures will either happen at your date’s house or, if you’re going with a group, at a friend’s house. Be cooperative and smile for all the pictures. And make sure you thank the host before leaving.When posing, place your arm behind the small of your date’s back and let your hand rest on her waist.
Take some goofy pictures too. This is a big milestone, so have fun with it.

"
"
Enjoy dinner.,
Party all night.,
Dance like nobody's watching.,
Take part in after-prom festivities.",How to Take a Girl to Prom3," This is a sophisticated night, so be on your best behavior. Show up on time and alert the restaurant if your party is running late. Pull out your date’s chair if you can. Be mindful of your table manners and tip generously before leaving.If you’re going with a large group, ask everyone to bring cash. It will accelerate the payment process enormously.
Pay for your date’s dinner. It’s the considerate thing to do. If she refuses, split the bill.

, You finally made it. Now, all that’s left to do is enjoy yourself. Dance with your friends, dance with your date, take pictures and video of the evening - whatever it takes to have a good time, do that.Take plenty of pictures, but don't spend the whole evening on your phone or you'll miss out.
Be attentive to your date. Don’t abandon her to run off with your friends the whole evening.

, Prom is a dance, so it goes without saying that you'll be doing some dancing. Don’t worry about how you look – the only thing that matters is cutting loose and making the most of your evening.Expect to dance most of the fast dances in a large group.
For slow dances, hold your date however feels comfortable (and appropriate).
If someone asks you to dance and you're not interested, a simple ""No thank you"" will suffice.

, Some schools offer after-prom parties, but if yours doesn’t, you’ll need to find an alternative means of entertaining yourself. Stay away from drugs and alcohol – there’s a strong chance that the choices you make on prom night can end up on social media and come back to haunt you. Feel free to lean in for a kiss, but do not pressure your date for sex. Be a respectful gentleman at all times.
For a fun after-prom activity, build a bonfire in someone’s backyard (safely). Or stay up all night and make breakfast the next morning.

Get glowing skin.,
Whiten your smile.,
Clean up your eyebrows.,
Hydrate your hair.,
Use a good deodorant or antiperspirant product.,
Add a pop of color to the eyes.,
Change up your hair.,
Treat yourself like a celebrity with a lip color change.,
Prioritize what's in your purse.,
Don't forget your ticket!",How to Prepare for Your Eighth Grade Prom1," Tame your acne with eye drops to reduce redness. Eye drops contain anti-inflammatory agents that help constrict the blood vessels.


Say goodbye to redness! Follow up with a nice lemon scrub to brighten your skin. It's best to do this at night, or try to avoid direct sunlight after. To top it off, use your moisturizer to hydrate the skin and neck.;
, You don't want to do any last minute things to whiten your teeth -- your teeth are delicate (and important!) -- so do this slowly over the course of the week. Crest white strips can do the trick.

, Plucking or waxing your brows the night before, or day, of your event, can leave your skin red from irritation. Give your skin some time to heal by doing this mid-week.

, Who doesn't want shiny and healthy hair? Use a leave-in conditioner to protect and hydrate your hair. You'll love whipping your locks around on the dance floor.

, If you're planning on dancing the night away, try to find a product that's long-lasting and fresh-smelling.

, A pop of color on your waterline is a great way to celebrate color without overdoing it.


Try using water liner (turquoise) for this. If you're not big on going crazy with your makeup, adding a sparkling top coat on your eyes can give you a glamorous look without making you look like a different person. Try something like em color facets sparkling shadow top coat (Moonlight Shimmer).

, Try using luscious curls. You can easily achieve romantic waves with a medium-sized curling iron. If you want to add more volume to your curls, take a brush and gently brush out your curls.

, What girl doesn't like having options? Not everyone can do a wardrobe change like Rihanna; a lip color change is much easier to play with. You'll feel fresh and ready for the camera in a matter of seconds.

, Prepping your body before prom is important, but don't forget to plan what's in your purse. Chances are, you'll be using a tiny clutch or bag much smaller than your everyday purse, so it's important to prioritize what to keep and what to leave.


No one wants to carry around a bag at prom that's stuffed within an inch of its life! To help you prioritize, try bringing five must-bring items that make the cut: blotting paper, lip gloss, bobby pins, safety pins and mints/gum.

, This may sound silly, but the last thing you want to do is get to prom and get stuck at the door. Remember to bring cash, your ID and ticket.

Decide on a color theme.,
Choose your flowers.,
Choose a filler flower.,
Choose your wristband.,
Choose any coordinating trinkets, if desired.,
Cut the stems of the flowers short.,
Bind each of the flower stems with floral wire and tape.,
Assemble the base of the corsage.,
Place the band in between the two sections.,
Form a bow out of ribbon.,
Attach the bow with the band and flowers.",How to Make a Wrist Corsage1," Stick to colors that compliment each other.


Consider the colors found on the dress or suit, and make sure your theme matches appropriately.
If for prom, consider using your school colors.
You can look at an interior design color wheel for inspiration if necessary. Choose colors that are opposite from each other on the wheel — for instance, yellow and purple, or blue and orange.;
, Purchase (or pick from the garden) flowers that are close to fully blooming, and keep them in water before you make the corsage. Plan on getting three to five blooms, depending on their size. In general, try to choose sturdy flowers that can hold up to some wear — they'll look better at the end of the night than delicate flowers, such as tulips. Here are some popular options to consider:









Roses
Daisies
Orchids
Lilies
Cymbidium

, This is an accent to the main flowers. It adds fullness to the overall corsage and highlights the color. Examples of filler flowers include:









Baby's breath (gypsophila)
Fern leaves
Eucalyptus

, The flowers are the main event, but how you anchor your corsage can change the aesthetic. Try these options:









Buy a corsage bracelet
Make a band out of coordinating ribbon or lace
Any band that is snug on your wrist

, An accent to a wrist corsage can be eye-catching and personalize your corsage.









Bracelet charms
Pearls
Lace

, Leave about 1/2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) under the bud.









Use wire cutters or scissors to cut the stems to equal lengths.
Add wire to any flowers with too-short stems.

, This will make it easier for you to bend the flowers into the position desired.









Start from the top of the stems and work towards the bottom. The tape wraps at a diagonal, like the stripes on a barber pole.
Make two rounds with the floral tape to completely cover the stems.,









Tape the primary flowers together in a bundle with the floral tape. Use the same diagonal method.
Tape the filler flowers in a separate bundle. Again, use the same diagonal taping method.
Bind the two bundles together with florist wire.
Attach any trinkets with florist wire at this stage.

, Attach the band to the group of flowers, again with floral wire.









The flowers should be pointing towards the elbow.

, Several strands of thin ribbon or one strand of wide ribbon work best.









The easiest way to form a bow is to make six loops of ribbon around your hand and cut off the ends at an angle.
Slip the ribbon off the hand and, holding the loops flat, wrap another section of ribbon around the center of the loops and tie tightly.
Start with the innermost loop of ribbon, slide it out and give the ribbon a twist to the left.
Pull out the next loop and twist to the right. Continue pulling out the loops and alternating the twists until both sides of the bow loops are out.
Hold the cut ends and shake the bow slightly to let it puff up., Use florist wire to arrange.









Make sure the band is big enough to fit snugly on your wrist without cutting off circulation.
Adjust as necessary.

A professional beautician will be able to help you achieve your perfect look while taking away the stress of doing it yourself. Make sure you budget enough time to get dressed afterwards!


Look for beauty salons that offer all of the services you need. There are many salons that offer hair, nail, and makeup packages.
Make an appointment in advance. Otherwise, you may not get an appointment in time.;
, Invite a group of friends over to get ready for prom together. Even if your friends have dates, it’s more fun to get ready with a group than alone. While you get ready, you can listen to your favorite songs, eat snacks, and reminisce about high school together.Make sure you give yourselves enough time to get ready. It’s better to have too much time than too little.
Some parents like to take photographs of their children before prom. If so, invite your friends' parents over to take photos when everyone is ready.

, Wear something that makes you feel comfortable and confident. Women should find a dress or outfit that flatters their body type. Pair the outfit with comfortable shoes that make you feel amazing. Men can pair a fitted suit or other attractive ensemble with stylish and comfortable shoes.


Consider coordinating your outfits if you’re going with a group of friends. For example, you could all wear black dresses.
Avoid wearing uncomfortable clothing. If it hurts while you’re trying it on, it will hurt even worse throughout the night.

, If possible, arrange for a car or limousine to take you and your friends to prom.Instead of arriving at prom alone, you will arrive with several of your closest friends. Additionally, if you are in charge of organizing the ride, you can decide who to include. If a limousine is out of your budget, consider:


Calling a nicer rideshare
Asking friends to contribute money towards the limousine
Asking a parent with a luxury car to drive you and your friends to prom

, Encourage your friends to hang out together, even if they have dates. This will help your awkward friends feel more comfortable with their dates and give you plenty of people to talk to.For example:


Encourage everyone to sit around the same table.
Guide your friend group towards the buffet so you can eat while you talk.
Drag your friends and their dates onto the dance floor when “your song” starts playing.

, This is the perfect opportunity to get to know your single friends better. You’ll have much more fun laughing, eating, and dancing with friends than you would with a date you barely know.Additionally, you won’t have to suffer through any awkward slow dances.


If your prom has a photo booth, consider taking date-style pictures with your single friends. These hilarious photos will be treasured mementos when you’re older.

, Even if you don’t have a date, you can have a great time dancing. Dance with your friends, with your best friend and their date, or alone. If you know how to dance well, show off your moves! If not, you can still have fun by trying your best or dancing badly on purpose.


Remember that everyone feels self-conscious while dancing. They’ll be too busy thinking about themselves to pay attention to any dancing mistakes you make.

, You don’t need to avoid your close friends just because they have a date. In fact, they may appreciate having a familiar face around while they’re making awkward conversation with their date. To help you relax, think of the event as a large group of people instead of a lot of different couples.Make an effort to talk to your friends' dates. This will help you get to know them better.

, Some of your friends may have come with boyfriends or longtime crushes. Throughout the night, there may be several moments when they’ll want alone time. Make an effort to recognize these moments and give them space to avoid wearing out your welcome. For example:


Avoid interrupting couples that are kissing.
If you see a couple arguing, don’t get involved.
If your friend is slow dancing with their date, give them some space.

, If you approach the night with a negative attitude, you will probably have a lot of negative experiences. However, if you start your evening with a positive attitude, you will be more likely to have a fun, memorable night. To have a positive attitude:


Think positive thoughts. Instead of dwelling on negative thoughts, think about how exciting prom will be.
Smile. Studies show that smiling can instantly improve your mood.
Focus on the good aspects of your evening instead of dwelling on any negative expectations., Many people feel that they have to find a date for prom. However, prom isn’t going to be magically amazing just because you have a date.In fact, some people choose not to bring a date to avoid any drama or heartbreak. For example:


If you don’t know your date very well, your evening may be filled with awkward silences.
If you fight with your date or if they leave with someone else, it will negatively affect your night.
Hanging out with close friends and reminiscing about high school is usually more fun than going on a date.

, Most people make prom into a big deal, thinking of it as a life-changing experience. However, prom is just one night out of your life. Once you graduate, you’ll go to college or enter the work force. You’ll create new memories, make new friends, and experience amazing things. You probably won’t think about prom again until your high school reunion.Instead of focusing on having the “perfect” prom, focus on spending time with your friends and having a great time.

, This is important whether or not you have a date. If you go to prom with strict ideas about how the evening should go you will probably be disappointed.Additionally, you may miss out on exciting new experiences because you’re trying to create the “perfect” night. Instead, go with the flow and try to have fun. For example:


If you and your friends are too late to make your dinner reservations, go through a burger drive-through instead. You will create hilarious memories and have time to relax.
If a friend changes plans, see what your other friends are doing and tag along.
Don’t be afraid to leave your comfort zone.

, Talk to your parents about the maximum number of people they will let you invite to your sleepover. Typically, sleepovers have around 2-8 guests, but it depends on what you're going for. Invite people who you want to hang out with, who make things more fun, and who will get along with each other. Also, try not to hurt any feelings by not forgetting someone in your group of friends.


If you have a shy friend who doesn't know anyone else, you have to decide if that person will actually have a good time, or if you will spend the night worrying about including the person in all of your games. Try to invite people that know each other, so they will enjoy with each other and feel more comfortable.

, You can mail your guests, use email, call, text, use Facebook, or even tell them in person.

You should tell your guests what time to arrive and around what time they should leave. Some people actually like to keep hanging out the next day until they get bored, but if you have something to do or your parents want them out of the house at a certain time, you should mention it in the invitation. You can also let them know if you'll be serving breakfast at a certain time.
It doesn't have to be so formal, either. If you just want to call each friend and tell them about it, that's fine, too. It's all about how much effort you want to put in.
If you want to make nice online invitations, you can check out a website like Paperless Post. They'll charge you a bit for each invitation, but not as much as you'd have to pay for most fancy paper invites.
Don't be disappointed if some of your guests can't make it. Some parents don't let their kids sleep over other kid's houses.

, Sit down and make a list of everything you'll need to make the sleepover a success. Don't forget food, dinner, snacks, movies, soda, decorations, or anything else you might want. Be sure to check in with your guests about whether or not they have any food allergies, or if they are vegetarians.


You'll probably need to go with your parents to get the stuff you need. In general, get a little bit more than you expect to need, so you don't run out of food or treats for your guests.
If you plan on having your guests stay for breakfast, then you should also plan to make sure you have some breakfast food, such as pancake mix and fruit, ready and waiting.
If you plan on playing any games you don't have, then make sure to buy them or to have a friend bring one over.
If you want to watch a movie, have it ready in advance.

, You may have a younger brother or sister who wants to hang out with you during your sleepover, but you may just want to hang out with your friends and do your own thing. If this is the case, then you should talk to your sibling about letting you have some time with your friends in advance. You can even promise to do something in return, like hanging out with your sibling one-on-one the next day.


If you can plan it so that your siblings are away with other friends during your sleepover, then even better!

, Once your friends RSVP to your parties, you can check in with them to make sure that they aren't allergic to animals if you have any; if they absolutely can't be around pets, then they should know that they won't be able to make it. Most people who are allergic to pets have allergy medication that can help, so letting them know in advance could save the night for them. Some people also have allergies to certain foods, such as peanuts, so check in with them in advance about this so all of your guests stay healthy.

, They will most likely come in with their parents, so be friendly to them and show them that you're a nice kid with a nice home. Tell your friends where to hang their coats, where to put their shoes, and where to put their sleeping things. Ask if they would like any food or drink. Give them a tour of the house if they are unfamiliar with it. Be sure to mention the places they can and cannot enter. Show them where the bathroom is, too!

, If you (with the help of your parents) already picked up some food to eat and make, such as hot dogs and hamburgers, then you should make the food if the guests arrive around dinner time. Don't leave people standing around hungry. You can offer them soda or snacks, like chips and salsa or guacamole, while you're waiting. You can also order pizza in, which is pretty commonly done at sleepovers, or even order Italian food, Chinese, or even Thai food if that's what your friends like.


Make sure to keep snacks, such as chips, vegetables, and dip, or pita and hummus around so the guests have something to snack on while you get ready to order food.
For sweets you could make cookies, brownies, cupcakes, go to the store and buy lots of sweets and popcorn because people always get hungry.
Make sure you have enough soda for everyone to drink, as well as the option of water, orange juice, or other beverages for people who don't like fizzy drinks. If you don't want people to get hyper and stay up all night, you can limit the caffeine intake later.

, If your friends like listening to Katy Perry, Justin Timberlake, Taylor Swift, or whoever is popular in your friend group, then put on some music and enjoy the great tunes. Get silly and dance around for a bit — you'll probably need to burn some of the energy you got from all of that food and soda! You can even have a dance off if you want to get fancy.

, Pillow fights are fun, exciting, and high energy. They normally happen spontaneously, so if you're in the mood to have one, just start gently hitting one of your friends with a pillow and wait for the fun to begin. You should first get down to where everyone's things are so that everyone has a pillow to throw. Just be careful not to hurt anybody and to make it clear that you're just playing around.

, If you and your friends like to play Wii or other video game systems, then you should make sure your guests bring their remotes in advance so as many people as possible can play. Just make sure to keep things light and not too competitive. If you notice that people are starting to feel left out, then you can do something else. Remember that not everybody likes or wants to play video games, and you don't want to leave out your less tech savvy friends.

, You want to remember the night! You could even have a mini photoshoot with your friends. Bring out your camera or your phone camera and start snapping pictures of you and your friends doing silly things. You can even bring out some ridiculous costumes and old clothes and goof off while wearing those. If your parents are still up, you can ask one of them to take a picture of all of you so you have a group photo.

, Not everyone may want to stay up until two or three in the morning, so you should let the people who want to sleep get some rest. If everyone else is being loud, you can even let the guest sleep in your bed or in a different part of your house so he or she isn't bothered. Get permission from your parents in advance.

, Games are a fun way to enjoy a sleepover. Make sure the games are easy to follow and don't take that long to play. For example, Monopoly is a great game, but it takes too long to play it; pick something that is better for the attention span of you and your guests.

, Get a flashlight and take turns telling ghost stories. You can even think of a scary story in advance, or tell all of your guests to come prepared with one. Whoever tells the scariest story can win a prize. Just make sure none of your guests are too freaked out; not everyone likes to be scared or to be in the dark.

, Watching a movie or TV is another great thing to do at a sleepover, but this should be done later in the night after you've burned some of your energy and just want to lie down and be entertained. It would help to decide on a movie in advance, whether you want to watch a horror movie or something fun and romantic. Sometimes people can spend so much time deciding what movie to watch that you end up just watching nothing, and you don't want the decision process to be a buzzkill.


Bring out the popcorn, cookies, and other treats. This will help make the environment more festive and party-like. You can even bring out some treats people would commonly see in a movie theater, such as M&Ms or Sno-caps.

, Though planning a million games and activities can make for a fun sleepover, sometimes the most fun you can have is just by sitting around and laughing with your friends. You can gossip, tell stories about your embarrassing moments, look through the yearbook to talk about your crushes, or just get to know each other better. If people are laughing and having fun, you don't have to change the mood by coming up with a ton of activities to do. Just let people enjoy themselves.

, If you're hosting and someone starts arguing or upsetting other people, take charge. If people are being noisy and keeping others awake kindly tell them that if they want to talk, they have to talk in another room. Try not to take sides and to listen to both sides of the story. You don't want to make enemies at your own sleepover.


Be on the lookout for tension that may arise. If you notice that guests start arguing a bit, you can change the subject to try to avoid conflict.

, You should only do this when it's time for people to leave. If you just happen to be up early, you shouldn't be rude and wake everyone else up for no reason. Be respectful of the people who want to keep sleeping. Once people start getting up, give them some time to get their acts together instead of trying to rush them to breakfast.

, If most people are hungry, tell your guests all their breakfast choices. If your parents are awake, ask them if they could make breakfast for you all. Try to get something most people normally don't have all the time, such as homemade Belgian waffles, but remember, have simple cornflakes or another plain cereal as an option too. Not everyone likes a big breakfast, and your friends may still be stuffed from all the awesome food you had the night before!

, This is something a polite host should never forget to do. Even if you're getting sick of having guests around and are ready for some alone time, you should be polite enough to walk your guests to the door and to thank them for coming. If their parents are waiting in the doorway for them, then greet the parents and thank them for stopping by. You can even offer to help carry your friend's things to the car.

, Throw out popcorn and plastic cups off the floor and into the trash. It was your party, so you have to clean up the mess, not your parents. If you do this yourself, then your parents will be much more likely to let you have another sleepover. If it was possible, you could have cleaned up a bit throughout the night or even had some friends help you if there was some downtime, but it's not fun to interrupt a party for cleaning. Once you've gotten everything back to normal, you can relax and enjoy having some time to yourself!

Obtain a good, realistic venue.,
Consider hiring an event planner if you can afford to do so.,
If possible, try to contact your guest of honor's high school and find out things like the school colors, the theme of the prom for the year (s)he would have gone, and maybe see if you can borrow one of the leftover tickets (some schools keep these on file or as keepsakes) to make reproductions of.

,
Make sure you budget enough for a crown and tiara (for the prom king and prom queen), and make sure your guest of honor is crowned king/queen.,
Make a yearbook.,
Try to make the prom as close to what it would have been like the year your guest of honor graduated high school.,
Try to get a few of your guest of honor's best friends, from high school, college, and/or now, etc.,
Arrange to rent a limo to pick up your guest of honor and his/her date - whether this is a current significant other or an arranged date.

,
Make sure your guest of honor has a date for the event.",How to Recreate a Prom for Someone Who Missed Theirs," Your ideal venue is any facility with some kind of dance floor, such as a ballroom at a hotel or even a community center, and/or a high school or college auditorium or gymnasium. As long as you have some kind of reasonable dance floor, any venue will do if it feels realistic enough. Check around in the area where you are planning to hold the event.;
, Depending on your budget, this might be a viable way to save yourself a lot of headache, but beware event planner fees can get pretty high too.

,, His/her date or significant other should be crowned as the other royalty member.

, This will not be nearly as difficult or expensive as you might think.

, Either play (or have your DJ play) songs from the era, and/or incorporate the popular trends of the time into the theme.

, to come., and try to get at least 20 people to come. You can invite more people if your budget will allow, but try to have at least 20 so it seems at least quasi-realistic. Make sure they all know to dress formally, as this is a ""prom"" theme.

,, If (s)he does not currently have a spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend, consider having someone serve as an escort for him/her. At a last resort, consider hiring a male or female escort (NOT an erotic one) for one night, but beware this can get expensive.

Get permission.,
Make a list of people you want to invite.,
Choose a date for the sleepover.,
Invite your friends to the sleepover.",How to Host a Movie Marathon Sleepover1," Before you start planning your sleepover, make sure you’ve spoken to your parents or parental guardian about it. Tell them that you want to host a movie marathon sleepover and let them know you’re very excited to try this sleepover out. Once they’ve approved the sleepover, tell them you will let them know the rest of the details after you talk to all of your friends.


You could say something like, “I want to try something new with my friends this weekend, and I really hope you say yes. I want to have a movie marathon sleepover! Our living room is definitely big enough and it will be so fun. Is it okay with you?”
You may want to add something like, “I was thinking of inviting between seven and ten people. Are you okay with that number?”;
, Once you get the approval from your parents, they are probably going to want you to tell them exactly how many people you’re inviting and what their names are. Grab some scrap paper and a pen and jot down the names of your closest friends. If there are a few other people you’d like to get to know better and you think they’d enjoy a sleepover like this, write down their names, too.


Once your list is made, bring it to your parents. Don’t start inviting your friends until your parents confirm their approval of the list.
You can say to them, “Here’s my list of friends for the sleepover. I really want to invite them all, if you’re ok with it. I will clean up after everyone once the sleepover ends and everyone leaves, I promise!” Follow through with that promise.

, Now that you know who you’d like to invite to the sleepover, choosing a date will be much easier. Talk to your friends about their upcoming plans and activities for the next couple of weekends. Once you’ve asked everyone, choose the date everyone can make it to. Aim for a Saturday, since this is usually the best day of the week for a sleepover.If not everyone can make it to a certain date, go with the second-best option.


Let your parents know the date you’ve chosen so they can be prepared for a full house.
You could say, “I’ve picked a date for the marathon sleepover! It’s this Saturday. Is that okay with you? If you have plans or if that’s not a good day for you, please let me know and I can choose a different night.”

, Now you can officially invite your friends to the marathon! You could just tell them the plans, but why not make it fun? You could create a Facebook event for the marathon and invite your friends that way. Present them with mock tickets that you've printed up that say ""Admit One"" and include all of the relevant information. Make sure it's clear when the start time is so that no one will arrive late and miss the beginning of the first movie!


If one or two of your friends seem less than thrilled about the idea, ask them why. Some kids don’t like to spend a night away from home or perhaps they have a difficult health issue. Try to work around any issues that come up.You could pull your friend(s) aside and say, “I noticed you didn’t seem very excited about the marathon sleepover like everyone else was. Do you not like the idea, or is there some other reason? I really want you to come, but only if you want to.”

"
"
Decide who you're going to invite.,
Remember to include the time, date and venue on your invitations, plus an RSVP date.,
Decide which room you'll sleep in.,
It's fun to camp on the ground on mattresses and blow-up beds.,
If you don't have a television in your sleeping venue it's a good idea to have one, even if it's just a small portable one.,
You'll need lots of snacks and drinks, like popcorn (make sure everyone likes your chosen flavour otherwise it's not fair on them) and sweets (e g jelly laces, Haribos, chocolate bars etc) for snacks and for drinks Coca-Cola, Fanta, Lemonade, Dr Pepper etc and for those that don't like fizzy drinks have an array of fruit juices such as apple, orange or blackcurrant.,
Make sure you get a really early night before the night of the sleepover so you're not tired the next day- you'll find yourself dropping off before your head hits the pillow!

,
On the day, greet your guests politely and nicely and show them round your house if they are unfamiliar.,
Watch films and have loads of fun.,
At around midnight, if people are getting tired, let them sleep.,
For food, You don't have to be fancy.,
When you settle down, make sure all the popcorn bowls and sweet bowls and cups are off the beds so you don't roll on them in the night.,
In the morning, if you wake up at 7:00 am or earlier, go back to sleep or quietly do something else.,
At around 11:30, if some of your guests are still sleeping, this is a good time to wake them because you'll have no time left together!,
If it's a sunny day, it's a good idea to play in the garden to wake you up.,
If you do go to the park, make sure you get back home in time for your guests to leave.,
When your guests leave, be sure to thank them for coming and if it was a birthday, for your presents.,
Once the final guest has left, you need to clean up.",How to Host a 10 Year Old Sleepover," Aim for 2-6 guests so there are enough people to have fun with but not too many so it gets out of hand. Plus, you need enough room to sleep and less people to please. Remember, don't be disappointed if someone can't make it. Have a backup list planned in case you end up with hardly any guests. Some people may be able to stay for a while but not for the night.;
, Be sure to give your guests plenty of time to reply, you don't want to spring on them with only two days to reply.

, If your bedroom is quite large, it would be great, but a living room is a popular venue for your sleeping area. Decorations are a great idea but not compulsory- if there is a theme to your party, think about what sorts of decorations you want. If you are looking at themes, you should get decorations early so that you can plan it out.

, Make sure there is enough room for everyone to space out, and have enough blankets and pillows for everyone. If it is Summer time, you could perhaps camp in the back yard! If your guests have long legs, put them on the end so there's less chance of them kicking you accidentally!!! Also, If you are very crowded, you can just ask them to bring a sleeping bag of their own.

, Even if you're interested in the programme, it can make you drowsy and it's good to help you drop off to sleep eventually.

, Also it's a good idea to have some fresh water.

,, Be sure they know where they're sleeping, where the bathroom is and where your parents are sleeping.

, If you want, telling scary stories adds a spooky atmosphere, but if anyone starts to get really scared snap on the lights and play a fun game to cheer them up.

, You should be thinking about sleeping at 2:00 am at the latest. After all, although it's a fun sleepover, you don't want to be awake ALL night!

, you could order pizza and eat popcorn! They are both popular for sleepovers.

, It really hurts!

, Your guests might be tired and won't want to be disturbed after going to sleep too late. Don't make fun of anyone who goes to sleep early.Discuss with your parents what time they can expect you to settle down, if they are checking upon you every so often.

, They won't mind when they see the time- they'll most likely laugh!

, Even better, the park is a fun place to hang out. Don't go straight away, you might still be dopey with sleep and hurt yourselves.

, Greet their parents politely and perhaps ask them in for a cup of tea.

, Wave them off good-naturedly - it gives a good last impression before they leave.

, It was your sleepover, so why should your parents have to clean up? Take all the bowls and plates and cups to the kitchen and wash them up/put them in the dishwasher. Put all the bedding in the wash basket and deflate the airbeds and put those away. Lean the mattresses against the walls so they are out of the way for anyone that wants to use the living room next. If you clean up, your parents will be more likely to let you have sleepovers more often!

Get your friends involved.,
Select a movie series.,
Go with a theme or particular genre.,
Choose several movies featuring one actor or a specific time period.",How to Host a Movie Marathon Sleepover2," Poll your friends for their ideas on possible movies to watch for the marathon. You could also provide them with some options and let them choose. If your friends can’t agree on what to watch, you can always ask everyone to bring their favorite movie with them to the sleepover. Then everyone can pick from that group of movies once the sleepover starts., Choosing a series allows everyone to really immerse themselves in that particular “universe.” Consider something fun, like the Harry Potter series. If you and your friends are fans of science fiction and fantasy, Star Wars and Lord of the Rings are also great options.The Back To The Future series could be fun or, if you want something a little more serious or dramatic, you could go with the Twilight series.If you and your friends like horror movies, you could consider A Nightmare on Elm Street marathon, or something along those lines. Be sure that all of your friends (and their parents) are okay with horror movies before making the final decision.

, This allows you to have a little more variety in your movie marathon. The theme or genre could be something broad, like romantic comedies or horror movies. You could also narrow the scope a little and pick movies that all share one common feature. For example, you could choose movies that all have princesses or vampires featured in them.If It’s close to a holiday, like Halloween or Christmas, consider doing a marathon of movies with a seasonal theme to match.Movies with music and singing in them, like Rocky Horror Picture Show and The Wizard of Oz, might be a really entertaining option for everyone, especially if you all sing-along and get into it.
An all-Disney movie marathon could also be fun, and there are plenty of Disney movies to choose from. Everyone could vote or pick their favorites.

, Perhaps all of your friends really love one particular actor who has been in a lot of films. You could choose movies for the marathon that all feature this actor. For example, if your friends like Ryan Gosling, watch all the movies he stars in. Or maybe everyone loves Audrey Hepburn – you could have a marathon of her films.Another option is selecting a time period, like all-90s movies or all-80s movies.If you wanted to get really specific, you and your friends could choose a specific year or handful of years. For instance, you could choose movies made in the early 80s or late 90s.
Ask your friends what they think about this idea and decide as a group who the celebrated actor or time period will be.

"
"
Set up a cozy area for everyone.,
Have plenty of snacks and drinks available.,
Decorate or have party favors that match your marathon theme.,
Take a few mandatory breaks during the marathon.",How to Host a Movie Marathon Sleepover3," Since you will be staying in the same general area for hours at a time, make it as comfortable as possible for everyone. Choose the biggest room available, or the room that can comfortably hold all of your friends. Get out extra blankets and pillows for everyone. Ask your friends to bring along their own pillows and blankets, too, so the extras can be for creating extra fluff.


Watch the movies on the largest screen you have at your house, so that everyone can see easily from anywhere in the room.
You could push all of the furniture up against the walls and create one large pallet for everyone on the living room floor.

, Ask your friends about their preferences and get what you can. You can also have general stuff like chips, pretzels, candy and popcorn. Keep some healthy options on hand, as well, like veggie trays and sliced fruits. For drinks, try to cater to everyone by offering an assortment of soft drinks, juices, sugar-free beverages and bottled water.You will most likely need to eat at least one meal during the marathon, so do something super easy that everyone can share, like ordering pizza.
Talk to all of your friends before the sleepover and find out if anyone has any food allergies or dietary restrictions.
If you want to have a little fun with refreshments, consider doing themed snacks that go along with the movies!

, Create a little atmosphere before your friends arrive. For example, if you’re going to have a horror marathon, you could get out some Halloween decorations or hang up red Christmas lights to create an eerie mood. For a Harry Potter marathon, you could buy plastic wands for everyone and order a cake shaped like Dumbledore or a Golden Snitch. Or you could buy several pairs of round costume glasses (like Harry’s) and hand them out to everyone when they arrive. Get creative!


For a Star Wars marathon you could hang up strings of white lights and put glow-in-the-dark stars on the walls. Make the room very dark when the movie starts so it will feel like you’re in space! Or you could buy plastic light sabers for everyone.
If you’re having a princess-themed marathon, you could get everyone a tiara to wear and order a cake shaped like a castle., Brief breaks will occur naturally whenever someone gets up to use the bathroom or get more snacks, but it’s a good idea to take a few mandatory breaks during the marathon. Everyone can get up, stretch their legs, get their blood circulating and spend a few minutes outside in the fresh air and sunlight.Between movies is a natural place to have intermissions, so let everyone know that at the end of each movie there will be a 15 minute break.
Encourage everyone to get up and walk around or go outside for a brief change of scenery. If going outside isn't an option because it's late at night, you could play a game like 20 Questions so that everyone's minds can switch gears for a few minutes.

These few simple decorating tips will really help set the mood as you start playing the games and activities.
Need an Army Happy Birthday banner? Check out this Camouflaged Birthday Banner that will fit your theme perfectly.

, Use a white vinyl shower liner and 10"" black vinyl letters (you can purchase these from an officer supply store). On the banner you can write something like, Bikini Bottom or Rock Bottom. You can also let your children or guests draw Army characters all over it.


Tie helium balloons of different shades of green, brown, black, etc. in clusters of 3 or 5 to the back of chairs or tucked into corners. Don't forget to tie a bunch of balloons to the birthday child’s chair. If you choose not to use helium, tie balloons to varying lengths of curling ribbon, and hang them from the ceiling or from light fixtures throughout the house.
Move on to another simple, yet familiar decorating item, Streamers. Streamers offer an economical way to splash lots of color around the site of the party. Create a fun and colorful effect by draping rainbow colored metallic streamers from the center of the ceiling to the walls on each side of the room. The streamers can be twisted after they are anchored to a ceiling wall or table for a more dimensional look. Two different colored streamers can be placed back to back and twisted for a unique look. After you are done, it should look like a spiral rainbow above the room! They also look terrific hanging from door frames or cascading vertically down walls. Streamers are an excellent Army Theme Party Idea.
Clear out all toys and books, except for those related to the Army Theme.

, Check out our Free Clipart Section for ideas.

, Put one on the shed, if you have one, which says, “The Brig”. Hang another around the kitchen for the “Mess Hall”. If you need to contain the kids in a specific area, hang signs that read, “DANGER KEEP OUT EXPLOSIVES” around the off-limit areas. Kids will love this special touch as it makes them really feel like they’re in the military.

, Stick with green, brown, black, etc. After you have selected the party theme colors, decide on whether you will use either printed or solid color party tableware.


Here are some great Army Theme Party Tableware.

Army Dessert plates
Army Dinner plates
Army Beverage Napkin
Army Luncheon Napkin

, Now that you have picked out the location, selected a few decorations and picked the theme colors and party tableware, what is your child going to wear at their Ultimate Army Theme Party? Wouldn’t your child love to dress up as a Soldier? Here are a few Ultimate Theme Party costumes!!


Check out Face Paint Crayons. You can decorate the children's faces however you want, with camo, tanks, airplanes, etc!!!

Icebreaker Activities

Trying to keep the guests attention until the party starts isn't an easy task. But with these kid theme party ideas listed below you won't have any problems!
Let those who’ve arrived early play with Bubbles while they wait for the other guests to arrive.
A coloring activity is a great way to keep the children occupied until the party starts. Plus, you can send their pictures home in their goody bag.


Have the children decorate a large birthday banner in honor of your child that says, “Happy Birthday, Name”. You can get a large roll of paper from a store like Target. Give the children crayons, stickers, and other such items to use.

, Attach to Popsicle sticks.


New Recruits: Right from the beginning, you need to gain control of the party and make sure everything flows smoothly. You need to get the children in the “Army” mood right away. Setup a table right by the front door. As they come in your home, have them “sign in” as if they were joining the Army. You can issue them dog tags, helmets or any other item to help get them into the Army spirit. The kids will love this and you will set the stage for the Ultimate Theme Party.
War Paint: Your new recruits are going to need to transfer from “civilian” to “military”. There is not better way than to help them put on their War Paint. After they have “in-processed” send them over to the War Paint station. This will help keep their attention until the real party starts.
Water Balloons: If you’re going to have a water balloon war later in the party, this would be a perfect time to get the balloons ready. Have the children fill up the balloons now and watch their anticipation grow, as they can’t wait to throw them at each other. Check out the games section for complete details on the game.
Jet Fighter Training: Have the children construct different Jet Paper Planes and see whose plane will fly the farthest. This should keep them occupied until the real festivities start.

, If the kids are standing around with nothing to do, you have forgotten something. Try to keep them occupied at all times and the party will flow smoothly.

, Picking out the perfect food, refreshments, treats and cake should be a fun experience. Think of clever names for each item that relates back to the Army Theme. Pick out a birthday party idea or two to get started:


Army Theme Party Food.
If you are looking for a good food to serve and one that could give you a break, try old faithful, pizza and soda. Almost every kid loves pizza and soda, and this could earn you maybe 20-30 minutes of time to cleanup, setup or just sit down. You know every drill sergeant deserves a break.
You could also setup a mess line and serve simple items such as, Mac and Cheese, Hot Dogs, Chips and other items right out of your kitchen. If you have the room and equipment, setup a mess tent where the soldiers go and eat. They will feel just like the military eating in a tent.
Don’t want to give your soldiers a home cooked meal? Call the local Army Surplus store and buy some good old-fashioned MRE (Meals Ready to Eat). The party will definitely be a hit. Kids will be talking about it for months about how they ate MREs at their friends Ultimate Army Party.
Army Theme Party Refreshments:
Now we need some refreshments to wash down all this excellent food.
Try making the Swamp Punch. Take some light lemonade and add green food coloring. Kids will love it because of the color! Want to add your own special touch? Add two raisins to each cube in an ice cube tray. They will end up looking like little bugs in the punch. The soldiers will feel like they’re “roughing it” when they are eating “bugs”.
Army Theme Party Cake:
Deciding on whether you are going to make or buy the Ultimate cake is a tough decision. It mainly depends on how much time you have and how many guests are coming. I would suggest for a smaller party, you Try to make that Ultimate cake. But if there is going to be a large number of guests, maybe a large cake made by the baker would be the best decision. It’s up to you, but here is a Birthday Theme Party Idea for making an Ultimate Army cake.
Tank Cake: This is a simple yet awesome cake to make. Start out by using a 12x18 sheet pan and a half of a Wilton ball pan (can be found at many craft stores and Walmart). Cut sheet cake in half and stack it, slice an angled wedge off of the front and then put the round part on top. You can use Juniper colored icing, a long thick pretzel covered in frosting for the cannon and Oreo halves for the wheels. You can also add a flag on a toothpick and decorate with Army men and crush Oreos and graham crackers for dirt. Not only will this cake taste good it will be the centerpiece of the party.
Army Battlefield: Start out by making a sheet cake. Cut a small area out and turn it upside down to make a little hill. Fill the hole with blue tinted pudding to make a lake. Frost the rest of the cake with chocolate frosting. Crush some graham crackers and vanilla wafers for dirt and spread over the cake. Set up an Army battle using plastic army toys.
Edible Army Logo: Want to really impress your soldiers? Check out this Ultimate Army Logo, which will turn any ordinary cake into the Ultimate Birthday Cake.

, At night you can sit around a campfire, tell scary stories about fallen soldiers, and sing songs like the Balled of the Green Beret.

Throw yourself a ""prom party"".,
Seek out and attend an ""Adult Prom"".,
Attend someone else's prom.,
If you live in or near, or can practically visit for a while any of the following: Los Angeles, New York City, Toronto, or Vancouver, consider trying to get a job as an extra in a movie with a prom scene.,
If your high school holds an ""alumni prom"", attend that.,
Attend your high school's upcoming prom if they will allow you to.,
Chaperone a prom.",How to Make Up for Missing Your Prom," Drew Barrymore and Taylor Swift both famously did this. Sure, it might seem a little self-indulgent or downright self-absorbed, and will probably be expensive, but if it will give you closure, and it's within your means to do so, then go right ahead. Most people who do this tend to either hold it at a community center or make arrangements to rent out the local high school gymnasium during the summer. If you really have money to burn, you can rent a hotel ballroom (like a lot of high schools do now anyway), hire an event planning service to do all the work for you, and make it extremely realistic. You can even have yourself crowned ""prom king"" or ""prom queen"" if you are really feeling self-indulgent (hey, it's okay if you're paying for the party, right?);
, Before you get creeped out by the terminology, NO, an ""adult prom"" is NOT an X-rated version of a prom. It's a party that exactly resembles a prom, but marketed toward adults who are either looking to re-live their prom night, or make up for a missed prom. They often go out of their way to be realistic, even crowning a ""king and queen"", You can also do an Internet search on ""adult prom"" to see what the options are in your area. You may have to be age 21 or older to attend, as many serve alcohol.

, In the novel ""Nobody's Property,"" it is referenced that one of the supporting characters, Elise Matthews, had missed her prom by being wrongfully grounded by her overprotective big brother, but one year later went to someone else's prom as their date to make up for missing her own, hence the reference in portions of the novel that she was ""a year late for her own prom."" Elise may be a fictional character, but the possibility of attending someone else's prom as their date is very real. People ""date down"" all the time. Depending on your age and/or school policy regarding non-student prom dates, you might just be able to go as someone's date to their actual high school prom. This works best for people who are reasonably close to high school age themselves, i.e. someone who is 21 will have a better chance of success than someone who is approaching middle age. Though the latter could always chaperone a prom. Taylor Swift famously attended someone else's prom after missing her own (in addition to having a ""prom party"" thrown for her after her first record went #1) and it was even the subject of an MTV reality show, where dateless high school boys were offered a chance to have her as their prom date. Now, unless you're famous, you won't be able to have your own reality TV show to find someone to take you to prom with them...but there are other ways to go to someone else's prom as their date.

, Before you cross this off as a completely ludicrous idea, consider the following. In these four cities, movies with prom scenes are shot at least once or twice a year (in EACH). This works best if you can reasonably pass for prom age, and/or if you'd be willing to play a ""faculty"" extra rather than a ""student"" extra. Keep in mind that auditions probably won't be held during prom season - prom's a popular topic, and a movie that is released in the spring, in time for ""prom season"" is usually shot 6 to 18 months ahead of release.

, Some high schools hold special ""alumni proms"" (not to be confused with reunions) as fundraisers - alumni and faculty are allowed to attend. These events are usually semi-formal to formal.

, Some high schools allow alumni to attend prom if they wish to do so. Others may require a little coaxing (usually in the form of a donation). Late Wendy's founder Dave Thomas had dropped out of school to serve in the military, but later got his GED 35 years later, and went to his high school's next prom with his wife that year. Many schools not only allow, but encourage alumni to attend future proms. Don't expect to be crowned king or queen - you won't be eligible, and even if you were, would that really be fair to this year's class? - but at least you'll have a prom. This option will work best if you have a really good reason for having missed your prom (military service, etc.), and/or if you are in the financial position to make a reasonable donation to the school. Some schools don't care as long as you buy a prom ticket.

, Granted, this is not the same as actually going to your own prom, but high schools need chaperones at every prom, every year. Prom chaperones are responsible adults who attend the prom with the students to ensure the safety of the students attending, as well as to prevent improper conduct. You won't be all that popular, and forget about being crowned king or queen, but you'll be at a prom. Chaperones are typically parents of students and/or alumni, but most high schools will gladly take any extra volunteers for chaperones they can get. If you have a clean record, this might be a viable option for you.

Tell your parents about your epic sleepover plan.,
Order pizza by a highly acclaimed pizza delivery service.,
Stock up on movies.,
Do fun make-overs!,
Read the best fashion magazines out there.,

Do fun crafts, like making duct tape purses.,
Have a fashion show.,
Play ""Truth or Dare"", ""Two Truths and a Lie"", or ""Would You Rather..."".,
Never try to take over the party and keep things cool.,
When you're at a sleepover play fun things everyone will enjoy.,
Get all electronics charged and connect on DS or PSP or play on Wii, Xbox etc.,
Listen to CDs.,
Have a race to see who can find their gummy worm first!",How to Host a Great Sleepover for an 11 Year‐Old," If they don't agree, just act real good for a day or two, and then wait another day to ask them about the epic plan. They will probably agree. If they don't, just keep studying to get good grades, and help around with lots of chores. This will show them how much you care and they will probably let you.;
, Your best buds will giggle and munch with delight! Or make cupcakes or another yummy treat.

, Depending on if your friends are allowed to watch PG-13 or not, jumble up on some romance movies or comedies. Horror movies would also be good if you aren't scared easily. If you can't find a movie that all of you want to watch, then find a movie that everyone doesn't like and comment on it, but only if your friends want to. You could also ask your friends to bring movies so that way everyone will have at least 1 movie that they want to watch. Just don't watch too many movies, since your friends might want to talk and do other things instead of just watching movies.

, Borrow body lotion, gel, flat irons, eye shadow, foundation, mascara, lipstick, bronzer, and every other makeup on the planet! You can try doing one another's hair in beads or pick flowers outside to put in their hair. You may be allowed to spray their hair with temporary (and temporary only) hair dye of a fun color (confer with the parents first).

, Try not to read magazines like ""Glamour"" or ""Cosmopolitan"" because the advice is for women and won't help you at all, considering the fact that 11 year old's don't need ""50 Tips for Getting a Hot Boyfriend"" in a magazine. While including boys, make up, fashion, body problems, and inspirational stories, try reading things like ""Twist"" (celebrity fans), ""Quizfest""(getting to know your friends), ""Girls Life"" (for advice on everything and top fashion tips), ""Seventeen"" (for ideas on what to do on almost everything with fashion inspiration), or ""Teen Vogue"" (high fashion and celebrity fans).

, Get the best prints ever, like leopard prints in pink or polka dots in raspberry red. You can try making collages from your favorite magazines and posting awesome articles on paper! You could even make some cool types of slime. Try watching some YouTube videos for inspiration., Put each other in the cutest clothes (DIY accessories is a must!) and have them strut on the runway. Before the show, host a catwalk walking class and teach each other how to walk like real models.

, It is a great way to get to know your friends better and have a little girly, feisty fun on the way! In the meantime, keep things to the minimum (no saying, ""I dare you to hop on your foot twice"") and keep things to the maximum (no saying, ""I dare you to take off your bra"") Keep things clean but fun!

, Make sure that each and every guest feels welcome and not left out.

, Let people go home always feeling like its the best time ever not make them think your leaving them out.

, You could even download games on an iPad or phone, or post pictures on social media (Instagram, Snapchat, etc.)

, (You can dance or sing or model along) Good CDs are One Direction, Justin Bieber, Taylor Swift, Drake, or anything else you and your friends like. If you don't want to do that, then try making a song with all of your friends and record that!

, You try to win or send every one home!  Instructions: get several paper plates and put one or two (same amount on each plate) gummy worms on each one. Then, spray some whipped cream on to each plate (you can add other toppings if you like). Spray enough to cover the gummy worms and give to each guest (including yourself). Once you all have a plate, have a race to see who can find their gummy worm first by sticking your face in to the whipped cream and grabbing the gummy worm with your mouth. It's a party game and a tasty snack!

Help clean up.",How to Host a Birthday Sleepover," Turning your birthday sleepover into a themed party can be a ton of fun and can make your party even more memorable. There’s lots of different themes to choose from, but here are a few popular options:


Different decade theme. Dress up like you were born in the 60’s, 70’s, 80’s, or 90’s.
Movie theme—you could choose Harry Potter, Twilight, The Hunger Games, or Divergent.
Sports theme
Hawaiian theme
Pop star theme—you could choose Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez, or Taylor Swift.;
, While decorations are optional, they can make your house feel more festive--especially if you're hosting a themed party. Sometimes it's as simple as hanging up some colored lights or buying a few rolls of streamers.

, Have a parent or adult family member go with you to a craft store or grocery store to buy everything you need for your party. If you’re planning on making a meal or offering snacks, make sure you have all the right ingredients.Make a checklist before you head to the store so you can keep track of your supplies.
Consider going to a dollar store to buy your supplies. Dollar stores are inexpensive and you can often get more bang for your buck!

, You could choose to write your invitations on construction paper or card stock and hand them out at school, send your friends a Facebook message, or have your parents send out emails. Whichever method you end up choosing, make sure to include accurate information about what time the party starts, how old you're turning, what the theme is, if food will be provided, and what time parents will need to pick up their kids in the morning.


Make sure you send your invitations privately so others won’t feel left out if they’re not invited to your birthday party—remember, you can only host so many people in your home.
Ask your parents how many people they’re comfortable hosting at their house. A normal range for a sleepover is usually between 2-8 people, but if your parents can accommodate more, go for it!
Ask parents to contact you if their children have any food allergies, and plan your menu accordingly.

, Make sure your friends know what the house rules are. You don’t need to be too firm, just make sure they know to respect your belongings and your parents’ rules., Before your guests arrive, make sure you have some snacks set out for them to munch on while they’re waiting for everyone else to show up. Some good options include chips and dip, party trays, pizza, and small sandwiches. If your parents will let you, order snacks or appetizers from your favorite restaurant.


Double check that your friends aren’t allergic to any of the snacks you’ve set out.
It’s a good idea to have some vegetarian options as well, in case any of your friends don’t eat meat.

, Putting on some of your favorite music can put everyone at ease and make the party more fun. You could make a playlist of all your favorite songs and even have a dance party!


You can also make a CD of your party playlist and give it to your friends as a party favor when they leave. A CD can be a great reminder of how much fun you had, and you can keep it for a long time!
If you chose a theme for your party, play songs that go along with it. If you don't have a theme, you can just play some birthday themed songs to get people in the mood to party!, There’s practically no limit to the activities you can choose for your sleepover, but it’s good to play games that will be fun and easy for everyone. Think about the things you and your friends usually do together and choose an activity you think they’ll enjoy.You could decide to:


Play a board game like Monopoly, Risk, or Sorry

Play a round of Twister

Play capture the flag
Play video games
Make a craft project
Play dress up
Have a scavenger hunt

Play with dolls or action figures
It's sometimes helpful to plan more than one activity, or have a couple of different games going at once so your friends can choose which one they like more. It’s also OK to come up with new games as the party goes on—you might end up discovering a game you really like!

, If you chose to have your parents bake or buy a special cake for your party, have your friends sing happy birthday and give everyone a piece of cake. Don’t forget to blow out candles!


Instead of a traditional birthday cake, have an adult relative help you make cupcakes. Cupcakes that come pre-mixed are usually pretty easy to make—plus, everyone gets to have their own.
Limit sugar and caffeine. While it’s usually a good idea to have some soda or punch available when your friends first arrive, make sure to limit how much sugar you consume after the sun goes down, otherwise you won’t be able to fall asleep.

, It’s up to you whether or not to require presents at your birthday party. It might be easier to just skip presents and enjoy spending time with your friends. If you do decide to open presents, make sure to thank each of your friends individually for being kind enough to buy you a gift. If you don’t like some of the gifts you receive, save your disappointment until after the party and smile after you open each gift.

, As the night goes on, it can be fun to get a flashlight and tell scary stories in a dark room. Make sure all your friends are comfortable with scary stories and be sure to stop if you see someone getting too scared.


Instead of scary stories, you can also tell jokes, come up with skits, or play truth or dare!
You could also go around the room and have your friends tell stories about the most fun they've ever had on their birthday. It might give you some ideas for games or help you plan your next birthday party!

, It might be fun to have all your friends sprawled on a giant quilt or pallet in the living room, but first make sure everyone is comfortable before you turn out the lights and get ready for bed.



Be respectful of your friends that want to go to bed early. If someone needs to be up early the next day or they’re used to going to bed at a certain time, find a place where they can sleep in peace and quiet.
It may be a good idea to tell your friends to bring their own sleeping bags. If you’re short on bedding, tell your friends to bring their own sleeping gear. Sleeping bags are fun and easier to put away than sheets and blankets—just roll them up and you’re ready to go!
If you like camping, see if your parents will let you pitch tents in the backyard and camp out. Make sure you have enough room in the tent for all your friends to sleep comfortably.

, A great way to fall asleep is to put on a good movie and turn out the lights. Have your parents make some popcorn or set out some movie theater candy. Take a poll and see what your friends want to watch—you want to choose a movie that everyone will enjoy. Here's a list of birthday themed movies to give you some ideas:


30 Going on 30
Sixteen Candles
Toy Story
Uncle Buck
Some of your friends might have different rules than you about which movies they’re allowed to watch. To be on the safe side, choose something that’s family friendly—plenty of great movies are!

, Gently tell your friends that it’s time to get up. If you have any morning activities planned, it’s important that your friends are up and dressed in time. If your friends forgot any overnight items like a toothbrush or towel, see if your parents have any extras laying around the house that they can borrow.

, It’s a good idea to have breakfast planned for your guests. Foods like pancakes or waffles are great choices because you can make the batter the day before and have it ready to go for mealtime. Simple breakfast foods like cereal or toaster strudels are also delicious options! Make sure to have plenty of orange juice or milk on hand as well.

, While you wait for your guests’ parents to arrive, turn on some cartoons or a fun TV show. Everyone knows that cartoons and breakfast go great together, and watching TV is a great way to relax and recuperate from all the fun you had the night before.

, It’s nice to put together a small bag of party favors for your guests so they'll have something to remember your birthday party by. You can include things like candy, small toys, nail polish, action figures, or other trinkets.


If you decide to include a CD of the birthday party playlist, you could label it with your name and how old you're turning, or make a decorative sleeve for the CD that goes with your theme.

, Thank your parents for all their hard work helping out with your sleepover. Help them clean up empty cups, spilled popcorn, streamers, nerf bullets, costumes, or anything else that you find lying around after the party. Helping your parents clean up shows them that you’re grateful for their help in making your birthday party awesome. Plus, showing initiative in cleaning up makes them much more likely to help you plan your next sleepover!


If you find something left behind by one of your friends, bring it to school the next day or have your parents contact their family.

, Either make your own facial mask or buy one at the store and give each other relaxing facials. Don't forget the cucumbers for the eyes!, Truth or dare is a good start as well as murder in the dark, charades, or hide and seek.


These may be difficult to play with just one other person, so just try them out and if they seem dull or boring move onto something else.

, Grab your pillows and begin swinging! Do this in an open area where you won't hit anything and make sure you aren't too rough.

, Twister is always a great party game as well as card games like ""Old Maid"" and ""Go Fish."" If your parents have an old game of Taboo grab the buzzer and ""Buzz"" when someone starts falling asleep.

, If it's not too late, go outside and play games like basketball or tag. Invite some neighborhood friends to join in your fun.

, Come up with a list of items to find or places to go and take a camera along with you so you can take pictures to document that you found the item on the list. If you're not able to leave the house then make a list of items you can find in your home or outside. Once you've found an item take a silly picture with it and then you and your friend will be cracking up as you are going through your pictures. Do this together as a team or make it a competition for who can find the most items on the list., There's never a better time to talk about your lives and share your secrets than when you are tired, hyped up on sugar, and eager to gossip. Grab your sleeping bags and talk with your friend about everything going on in your life.

, Make a pact at the beginning of the night that you are going to stay up as long as you can and maybe even make it a competition.

, Turn the lights off in your room, crawl into your sleeping bags, grab a flashlight and share your scariest stories. If you get really scared at least you'll have each other!


Not every one responds well to scary stories, so make sure your friend is okay with listening to them and won't be too scared.

, Look through your phone and find your friend's crush. Call them up and leave a silly voicemail.


Be careful that they don't already have your number, because that could be embarrassing.
Make sure your friend is okay with making prank calls before you call anyone.
Don't call a random number, because that could lead to consequences. Make sure you only call people you know who would think it was funny if they found out it was you.

, Stop at a local video shop or choose some flicks from your own collection. Maybe you're interested in watching a scary movie, chick flick, drama, or comedy. Decide on a movie based on the mood you're feeling.


No movie is complete without some popcorn and snacks.Set the scene by turning off the lights, getting some comfy pillows and blankets, and snuggling up in front of the tv screen.
If you always get tired during a movie, then keep the light on; it will help to keep you alert and awake.

, Pull up your favorite tv show on Netflix, Hulu, or find a marathon on tv and watch as much of it as you can before you fall asleep.

"
Convince your parents.,
Create a guest list.,
Get food- and lots of it.,
Embrace your feminine side.,
Try some more ""masculine"" activities.,
Avoid things like Truth or Dare and Spin the Bottle.,
Accept behavior that you may find weird or unusual.,
Give people a chance for privacy.",How to Hold a Sleepover with Boys and Girls," Ensure them of your true intentions- good, clean, fun. It will help if your parents can talk to your friends' parents, and if you have known your friends for quite a while. Make sure they are in a good mood when you ask, and that you have a reputation of being responsible and safe. Allow them to put limitations on the numbers of guests, noise and where you're allowed to sleep, if need be.;
, Keep the ratio of boys to girls reasonable, since most parents won't allow their daughter to stay the night with seven teenage boys and nobody else. In terms of numbers, about three to nine people is plenty, depending on what your parents say and how much room you have. Avoid inviting people who are seen as ""rowdy"" or promiscuous, and avoid inviting couples if you can.

, Teenagers are known for their appetites, and so a heap of food may be needed. Try to balance the healthy and unhealthy, since there's nothing worse than sharing a bathroom with everyone else who feels ill. Try things like pizza, energy drinks, soft drinks, chips, and sweets paired with fruit, sliced vegetables and dip, a cheese and bread selection, water and juice. If numbers are small enough, ask your parents to just double the ingredients for dinner that night, and have that as your main meal, and buy some snacks for the nighttime. Don't forget breakfast, as well!

, Girls here will note that there are few things more fun than a girly sleepover, but perhaps some activities associated with these are not so appealing to guys. However, you may find the boys will enjoy a good gossip session and will find the things girls take for granted as sleepover bread-and-butter absolutely hilarious. Here's some suggestions:


Dance/music routines. This is a staple for teenage girl sleepovers, and you can appropriate this by using games such as Just Dance or SingStar. If you aren't taking yourself seriously, this can be really fun for everybody.
Beauty and cosmetic related activities. Try blindfolded makeovers or facial masks with unusual flavors.
Talk, talk, talk. Having a healthy D.M.C (Deep Meaningful Conversation) at 3AM is always good for bonding. Discuss school, crushes, life, fears, worries and hopes. In a secluded environment, you'll find most boys are happy to open up.

, Boy's sleepovers are often held under wraps, and aren't shown in popular media like girl sleepovers are. For this reason, you may find you have no idea what your guy friends are used to. Here's some suggestions:


Movies. Ditch the romantic comedy in place of a comedy or a horror, or alternatively, try a ""so bad it's good"" movie, like ""The Room"" or ""Birdemic"".
Video games. Try a classic button-masher like Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter, or something else easy to pick up and not story-based. Also, try to pick something light-hearted like Mario Kart or Wii Sports. It may not be the sophisticated gaming experience you usually have at home, but it'll be fun nonetheless.
Surf the internet. Find flash games you can play together like ""The Impossible Quiz"" and search YouTube for your favorite funny videos. You can also use social media for a catalyst for gossip- but don't be too harsh on people.

, It may seem like a kill-joy, but you don't want to lose your parents' trust, or have any bad consequences because people start messing around. If you're wanting a game to play, try 20 Questions with people you know, or Never Have I Ever. You can also download apps like ""Heads Up"", or play charades.

, A lot of girls use sleepovers as a complete and utter rant session, and you may find them all going from angry, to terrified, to overjoyed, to crying and back again. Follow the ""what happens in the circle, stays in the circle"" rule, and don't judge. Alternatively, you may find boys have no restraints in talking about sex and playing games like ""F**k, Marry, Kill"". Don't worry, they'll grow out of this. For now, just accept it and move on, or join in the conversation.

, Even if every attending is comfortable with the idea of a mixed gender sleepover, they may still want time and space to either be alone or be only with same-gender friends. Definitely provide a safe, private area for them to change clothes away from the eyes of other guests, and consider whether anyone might want to sleep separated from their mixed-gender peers, too. People differ a lot in what they're comfortable with, so it's a good idea to provide the option, even if nobody uses them.

Provide lots of snacks.,
Try some new drinks.,
Don't forget the main course.",How to Have Fun at a Sleepover (for Teen Girls)1," One of the best parts of sleepovers is the snacks. You can provide typical sleepover snacks like chips, popcorn, cookies, ice cream, and candy. It’s also a good idea to have some healthier options like fruit or fresh veggies.When you’re choosing the snacks to have at your sleepover, be mindful of food restrictions because of allergies, religion, or even if your friends have braces.;
, You should have plenty to drink at your sleepover. This can include pop, water, and things like iced tea or lemonade. You can also ask your parents about mixing alcohol-free versions of alcoholic drinks – like strawberry daiquiris. These are lots of fun to make and can make your sleepover feel extra special., If you're having your friends over around dinnertime, you'll need to feed them something more than just snacks. What you have is up to you, and you can ask your friends what they like, too. You can order pizza, or set up a taco bar in the kitchen.

, Invite all of your close friends. Remember, you might not see anyone (not even your enemies) that you know next year, so invite everyone that you will miss.

, Think about your whole house. There may be a perfect room for a sleepover, but it's near your parents or sibling's room. Make sure its not around their rooms. The room should be fairly big, with lots of space.

, Think about your friends favorite foods. Also make sure your friends don't have any allergies to food or anything.

, If you are making them, you could make it with your elementary school's colors and symbols. Maybe put textbooks, or notebook paper pictures on the invitations. Be creative! If you're buying them, buy something that you think is cool, pretty, and your friends would think was cool. Remember to put when it is (date and time), where it is (your address), what your friends should bring (i.e. toothbrush, pajamas, sleeping bag, etc), what it's for, and your phone number.

, Think of things you and your friends like doing together. You might not get the chance to do those things again. Good ideas are:


Video Games
Pillow fight
Makeovers
Truth or dare
Manicures
Spotlight
Telephone
Board games

, Buy everything you will need a week or so before the sleepover. Things like food, games, etc. Also remember that your friends may forget some things. So buy some cheap toothbrushes and toothpaste. Maybe some hairbrushes. Also stock up on small flashlights just in case your friend have to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. Make sure you have enough blankets at your house. If not, buy more. A blow up mattress is also a good idea.

, Send it in the mail, take it to their house, or give it to them at school. Either way, invitations are important!

, The phone number and email is for reminders. The address is just in case you need to take one of your friends home if they get home sick. Also, get their parent's phone numbers.

, Get your parents to call your friend's parents reminding them also and telling them your address, phone number, and everything they will need to bring.

, Take out anything that could be easily broken, or you don't want to be touched or seen. Vacuum, dust, and maybe spray some air freshener.

, Like CDs, CD player, iPod and iHome, blankets, sleeping bags, flashlights, makeup, nail polish, magazines, games, etc.

,, When the guests arrive, show them where to put there stuff, and tell them to unpack.

, Tell them the off-limits rooms, like sibling's or parent's bedrooms. Also show them where the bathrooms are.

, Ask your friends what they would like to do first, since you might not see them again in a while.

,, Either eat in your dining room or in the room of the sleepover.

, Be happy that you get to be with your friends who you may not be seeing for a whole year and cherish the moment.

, This is the fun part. Grab as much yearbooks you can find, and haul them upstairs. Looking through all your old year books together is a great thing to do before middle school.

, Take lots of pics, and make funny videos. Maybe even post it on YouTube or Facebook! You don't want to forget that special sleepover!

, If some people don't want to, they don't have to. But the people that want to stay up with you will have to be quiet.

, Probably the best sleepover breakfasts are muffins, pancakes, or doughnuts.

, Still do some things in the morning.

,, Also wish them good luck for their first year at middle school.

Make a guest list.,
Choose a convenient date.,

Make a list of needed supplies.,

Give yourself and your friends a facial.,
Fight puffy eyes with cucumbers.,

Learn new hair techniques.",How to Have a Spa Sleepover," Spa parties typically involve just a few close friends because of space limitations. You want to make sure everyone can fit in the “spa room” without feeling crowded. If you have several rooms to devote to the spa — maybe one for mani/pedis, one for massages and one for facials — you can increase your guest list.;
, Once you know who you want to invite, check with them to find a date when everyone is available. You will also want to confirm with parents or roommates, as well as siblings, that it is okay to have a sleepover on the chosen date. You don’t want the soothing ambience of the party interrupted by their plans.


If you don’t want to have your siblings or roommates involved, ask them politely to stay in their rooms or go out for the night. However, it is often more fun to include everyone. Then you don’t have to worry about them disrupting the party.

, The best parties not only have a theme, but they have a plan. Know when you want your guests to arrive. Make a schedule of what you will do, what time you will do it, and where the activity will take place. By planning the evening, you can make sure everyone has a chance to do everything.When planning activities, be creative. You can have as many or as few activities as you like. For example, you might just want to do manicures and provide lots of polishes, nail decals, hand creams and hand massages. Or you might want a full-service spa with manicures, facials, massages, meditation rooms and a heathy-food café.

, Once you have planned the activities, you can make a list of everything you will need for each activity. Some things you will supply, but your guests can also be asked to bring some of their own items. For example, you might ask them to bring their own robe, towels and brushes, as well as their favorite lip gloss, lotions, candles and music., Invitations can be sent via regular mail or email. Either way, choose spa-themed invites featuring a picture of a slipper, an eye mask, nail polish bottle or other spa-related graphic. Include the theme, date, time, location and what your guests should wear. Include the list of items you want them to bring. Let them know how to RSVP.



Evites and digital invites are an easy way to quickly reach all of your friends. Several free online services allow you to design an invitation, send it to friends and tally responses all in one place. You can also easily create private events and send invitations via online communities, such as Facebook.

, You know what your guests are bringing, now it is time for you to get your own supplies. Large discount or warehouse stores, as well as beauty supply stores, will give you the best prices. Pick out some bright nail polishes, fun face masks, soothing tea bags, scented massage oils and other supplies for your planned activities. Imagine the perfect spa and try to replicate it. Remember that you must have enough supplies for all the guests.

, Small changes can turn your home into a relaxing spa. The key is to create a calm, quiet environment. Dim the lights. Place scented candles around the rooms you will be using — lavender and sandalwood are particularly relaxing scents. Play quiet music or sounds of nature, such as the sounds of the sea or rain forest. Serve pitchers of ice water flavored with lemon or cucumber slices.A big part in creating a calm environment is getting rid of clutter. Make sure your home is tidy and clutter-free so your guests don’t feel overwhelmed by “stuff.”
Make a poster of the services offered and post it outside the spa room. If you are using several rooms, make a poster for each room explaining what is offered inside.
Neck and shoulder massages can be done almost anywhere. Simply have a couple of straight-backed chairs available.

, Set out all the manicure supplies. You will want to include bowls of warm water for soaking hands and feet, polish remover, cuticle cream, clippers and nail files. Provide a variety of nail colors so your guests can choose their favorites. Providing clear top coat, as well as quick-drying spray, will make the area feel more like a salon.

, Use a gentle exfoliant cream to remove make up and prepare your skin. Then soak a wash cloth or towel in hot water, wring it out and drape it on your face to steam your pores. Follow with a soothing face mask. Remove the mask using the same cloth you used to steam your face. Finish by applying moisturizer using upward strokes and soft circular massaging motions.A clay mask is good for lifting impurities from your pores. Citrus masks are used for closing pores. Honey masks are great for moisturizing. Use all three types, one after another, to completely cleanse and moisturize your face.

Face masks can be homemade or store bought. Having recipes available for your friends to make their own masks will provide an additional activity for the night.

, After a long week of school or work, your friends will love a chance to lie down with cool cucumber slices on their eyelids. Beds, couches and air mattresses will all work as a “relaxation table.” Have soft music playing in the background. Set a timer for 10 to 15 minutes., Neck and shoulder massages are often part of a spa experience, and you can offer them, as well. Check out YouTube videos for some quick pointers. Remember that you want to massage soft tissue, so focus on muscles, not bone. You will want to put pressure on the muscles, but it should never be painful. Take turns acting as the masseuse so everyone gets a chance to both receive and give a relaxing massage., As part of the spa experience, you will want to provide your guests with light, healthy snacks. Sliced vegetables and hummus are always a good combination. Fruit, nuts, cheese and whole-grain crackers are also a good choice. Be sure to check with your guests to make sure no one is allergic to the foods you are serving.

, After you have finished your spa activities, you will want to do something that keeps you all in relaxation mode. Light, romantic-comedy movies are always good. You might also look into what TV shows are available on Netflix. Charades, board games and trivia contests will also provide a lot of fun without breaking the easy-going spell you have created.

, After finishing your nails and facials, you might want to learn a few new hair styles. Whether you have long hair or short you can have fun experimenting with a new style. Don’t do anything permanent that you might regret, such as cutting or dying your hair. This is the time to just have fun

, You don’t have to go anywhere special during your sleepover. Just going outside – to the backyard or maybe a nearby park – can make your sleepover more fun and special.


If you think you might go outside, make sure you tell your friends to bring appropriate clothes and shoes with them.
If it's warm outside, you can all bring towels outside and lay in the sun - just make sure you wear sunscreen first!
If it's cold and snowy, bundle up and have a snowball fight or build snowmen!
You can also use the outdoors as a backdrop for a fun photoshoot with your friends.

, You can have a camp out right in your backyard during your sleepover. Get a tent and ask your friends to bring sleeping bags. You can start a camp-fire if you have a fire pit, and use it to roast hot dogs or make s'mores.If you're having a sleepover in the winter, or if the weather isn't nice, you can still have a camp-out. Put your tent in the living room and make smores in the microwave.

, If you don't want to play Truth or Dare you can play Would You Rather? instead. Keep the game interesting and pick lots of dares. This makes you seem brave and if you get a gross truth that's really happened, lie. No one will like you if you reveal that you've masturbated or something.

, You can do love scenes, hate scenes, a wild word like ""Joe!"" repeated over and over, pretend to be Chinese and say your name is Wang, or anything else that you feel like doing that would be funny. You can switch to Truth or Dare/Would You Rather? after about a dozen prank calls.

, As the hostess, you have to stay up as long as your guests do. If you're getting really tired and can't stay up any longer, then yawn very loudly and others will start yawning, then leave. If you want, you could pull an all nighter.

, One night, you have a party and the next, sleep in. It lets you catch up on sleep and not be grumpy during the party. Be nice, make friends, and have lots of fun!

Get ready.,
After you've showered, the first thing to get set is hair.,
Wear the appropriate makeup.,
Bring some confidence.",How to Look Hot for a Party (Girls)1," If you want this party or event to be special, it's probably good to know where everything you need is ahead of time. Have your outfit laid out, make up at hand, and whatever you'll be taking to the party nearby. If you're hoping for a really fun, special night it's good to shower and have about 1 to 2 hours before the party to get ready.

, You can do this step however you'd like, but first give your hair a quick blow dry. After this style it however you want, or go with your natural hair. If you do style it, put on a quick spray of hairspray so your style look holds. Not too much so that your hair becomes stiff or clumpy, but just to keep it generally in place and how you'd like it. If you have curly hair (it depends on the texture) it can also sometimes help to air dry it, leaving you with soft natural looking curls.

, It all depends on the type of party or event, but start off with some neutrals. Maybe some eye shadow that complements your eyes or outfit, a hint of eye liner, a bit of mascara, a nice pink or nude lip gloss and a little blush. This again all depends on your personality and the type of party your going to, but that's a safe start for any occasion. Makeup is not necessary at all, but if your want a special night a little lip gloss and mascara could never go wrong.

, The last and maybe most important step in your hot party look is wearing your personality. Be YOU, which sounds cheesy but is really a good move. Be comfortable with yourself in your look and get ready to get a little flirt on for fun. Make sure to have fun and make this a party to remember.

Consider having a second chaperone.,
Decide on the budget for the party.,
Find a place to host the party.,
Make a guest list.,
Set a time and date.,
Let your teen send out the invites.,
Put away your valuables.,
Set up the party areas.,
Set up a music system.,
Supply the food.,
Keep your head during the party.,
Avoid showing your child(ren) any obvious signs of affection during the party.,
Avoid any surprises the child is not already in on.,
Let your teen clean up.,
Give your child an incentive to behave.",How to Host a Teen Party," Monitoring a teen party without killing the mood is a balancing act that will require a good attitude. Having a second set of eyes will make you feel less frantic and allow you to cover more ground. If the party is co-ed, having a chaperone of the opposite gender will help you deal with any issues that may come up.


If you know a trustworthy older teen or twenty-something who can handle a crowd, recruit them to chaperone the party. Explain rules to the chaperone and party-goers and then head upstairs or into a room where the party isn't being held. Check in every once in a while by getting something from the fridge.;
, Plan it out with your teenager so that they're involved. The good news is that sticking to teen-friendly food like chips, soda, hotdogs, and pizza should be fairly easy on your pocketbook.


How much should you spend on food and drinks? Decorations? Activities? Plan it out so that your budget isn't busted like a piñata after a party.
Luckily, a lot of teens are too cool for themed parties, so unless your teen has requested otherwise, your safest bet is probably to keep the party simple.

, If your teen is having a small party, your house would be suitable. If your teen is having a large party, consider setting up picnic tables and barbecues in the park (for outdoorsy activities) or renting a place such as a hall or recreation center (for more formal activities).


Be prepared for bad weather. If you are hosting your party out in a garden/backyard, make sure that you have a gazebo just in case the weather changes. Either that, or be ready to let the teens come inside your house.

, How many guests does your teen want to come to the party? How many can you comfortably handle? Come to a compromise with your teen so that both of you have a say in it; moreover, discussing and laying ground rules in advance will make it easier for you to deal with party-crashers if they show up.


Plan on accommodating a few more guests than you expect. Parties, especially teen parties, rely on word of mouth and can grow depending on which invitees are going or not going. Have a contingency plan.
Be sure to think about parking when planning the guest list. Just because your backyard can accommodate 20 people doesn't mean your driveway can.
Don’t let your teen invite anyone you aren't comfortable with.

, Knowing right when the party begins and ends will make it easier for you to kick out lingerers.


Set aside a soft end time and a firm end time. The soft end time is when your child or the chaperone is expected to start shooing people away. The firm end time is when the party must be completely over by.
Make sure that you plan the party in the beginning of the weekend or the holidays so that your guests don't have to worry about going to class the next day.
Also, be sure to find out whether other teens at their college/school are having parties around the same time; the last thing your teenager wants is having nobody come to their party because someone else is throwing one on the same night.

Be sure to let your neighbors know about the party in advance. This will make them more forgiving of the noise.

, Paper invites or e-vites aren't very cool if you're a teen, especially when coming from a parent. Let your kid send out the invitations via text, email, Facebook, etc., but make sure that they’re closed invitations so that not just anybody can see them. Be sure to require an RSVP so you have some sense of how many people to plan for.


Be flexible. Teens aren't known for their promptness or consistency, so don't be surprised of many more or fewer guests show up than expected.

, If you're having a big party, remove all expensive or fragile items out of the party areas and into a room that nobody will enter. Teens are usually trustworthy, but just in case there are a couple that aren't, keep your valuables hidden so they won't get stolen or broken.

, Ideally, the location should have a dancing zone, a drink and food zone, and activity areas (like a separate ping-pong table, Wii, and Guitar Hero area). If you have an outdoor firepit, it can double as an activity area and a way for the guests to cook their own hot dogs. Keep your teen very involved in this step, since he/she knows best what everyone will be interested in.


If your teen decides it’s acceptable to decorate, look in dollar stores or goodwill/thrift stores to find cheap decorations; those things can come with a hefty price tag.
Provide large, clearly-labeled trash and recycling bins. The fewer excuses they have to be messy, the better.
Invest in a dimmer switch. Dancing teens scurry faster than cockroaches when an adult turns the lights on. Since you probably don't want to have to deal with the consequences of keeping them turned off, a dimmer switch should make everyone happy.

, All you'll need for this are decent speakers and an Mp3 hookup. Don’t try to DJ for the party; every kid there will have hundreds (if not thousands) of songs with them on their phones and iPods – and even if they didn't, they probably don't want to hear your antediluvian jams.

, Teens love grazing, so set up a buffet-style area where everyone can grab as much or as little food as they want. Chips, salsa, and pretzels always do well at buffets, though make sure to throw in a plate of veggies and dip for athletes and anyone who wants to watch their figure. Be sure to have some dessert, whether it's candy, cake, or chocolate.


Use disposables. Using disposable plates, cups, and utensils will make it easier to clean up the mess after the party.

, Be prepared for noise, spills, broken items, and tiffs. Although a teen party should always be chaperoned, avoid hovering. Try to let your teen have fun without worrying about being embarrassed.


Let your teen come to you if there's a problem. Tell him/her in advance that you're giving them the responsibility of alerting you if anything goes wrong.
There is always a possibility that alcohol or drugs will show up at the party. If you trust your teen and know that they hang out with respectable and responsible teenagers, this probably won’t be an issue. If it does happen, however, you shouldn't necessarily take this as a poor reflection on your kid’s character. Keep an eye on things and if you do see drugs or alcohol that you do not approve of, stay calm and politely ask those responsible to leave. If the teen resists, call the teen's parents or, if you are too worried, call the police as well as the folks just in case things might get out of hand even more than they did when you first approached them.

, You love your children, and seeing them interact and have fun with their friends might cause you to be sentimental. But obvious signs of affection – hugging, kissing, pet names, etc. – are the death knell to a teen's sense of independence. Keep it low-key.

, If you're planning on inviting a mime to come and do an impromptu performance, then reconsider: kids usually have very rigid ideas of how they want their party to unfold. On top of that, they usually don't consider adult ""surprises"" to be all that exciting.

, This is the price of having an awesome party. Make the activity fun for them, if possible, by:


Offering to let them keep the cash collected by recycling any cans or cartons associated with the party. If it's a big party, they can clean up in more than one way!
Keep the music going, a movie in the background, or a few select friends around to help with the clean up. Six hands is always better than two.

, Tell your kid that if they handle themselves in a mature way, you'd be more than happy to let them throw another party or otherwise increase their responsibility. Life is all about risks and rewards; your child understands these very well, even if s/he hasn't taken economics.

Have fun and enjoy the show!",How to Host a Skype Movie Party With Your Friends2," This will call all the contacts added to the conversation. Wait until everyone is on Skype to proceed with watching the movie.

, You can also try a website like Netflix or something like it to watch a movie, but it might be a lot for an average desktop computer to stream that much at once. Turn your sound up high and make sure everyone can hear it. You can also connect a microphone to your computer and put it by your speaker to improve the sound quality.


If you want a more ideal sound experience you can spend some extra money to purchase a better hardware solution.It will cost about $30 or $40 but will give you much better sound for your movie party.
To improve sound with additional hardware you will need an audio splitter that goes from a single 3.5mm male connector to two 3.5mm female connectors. You will also need two RCA to 3.5mm headphone connectors. Finally, you will need a mixing board, some headphones and a microphone.
Take the splitter with two female 3.5mm connectors and insert the single 3.5mm male connector into headphone output on the computer. Attach the headphones to one female connector and attach one of the 3.5mm to RCA connectors from the other line to input the mixing board. Plug your microphone into the mixing board as well. Connect the last RCA connector to the output of the mixing board and connect it to the auxiliary audio input on your computer.
Use the mixers on the board to control the sound.

, Start playing the movie and you can adjust the size in your window so that everyone can see it.

Press play.",How to Host a Skype Movie Party With Your Friends3," You will need to do a little more advanced planning to watch the movie on separate televisions. Everyone will need time to get a copy of the movie to watch at their own home.

, It’s a good idea to use the bathroom too. Pausing the movie will make it difficult to keep in sync with your friends. It’s most enjoyable to keep the breaks during the movie to a minimum.

, Click on your movie party conversation or group and wait while the phone rings. You may need to give everyone a few minutes to get situated before they will be ready to watch a movie.

, You can start from the title screen, or you can pause at a frame and show everyone the screen to match it. This makes it easier to sync your movies if some people have different means of watching the film, such as streaming content providers.

, This is the tricky part. Have one person count for everyone. With a little effort of fast-forwarding and pausing the movies, you can adjust the movie so you don’t get an annoying echo over Skype.If you prefer, you can just have one person turn up the volume and mute the other televisions.

, You can talk and see your friends on Skype while you each watch the movie on your own television. It’s really enjoyable to share the movie watching experience with your friends, but still be able to watch it on a big television in your home.

Put up decorations.,
Even if you have the most fun things planned, being a good host(ess) will always make things that extra bit more fun!,
Most of the time, the most relaxed parties, which go with the flow, are the most fun.",How to Have an Awesome Teen Camp Out," Send out invites in the shape of tents and make them green! Make sure the date, time and place are very clear!;
, There are loads of fun games you can play at a camp out! In the day have water-fights, sleeping bag races, dance to some banging tunes, play celebrity 20 questions, the chocolate game (where you have 20 seconds to throw on some funny clothes-underpants etc. and run to a tray with a knife and fork and some chocolate - you have to try to cut a square and eat it within the time limit!), have a barbecue or play sardines. When it gets dark, play flashlight tag, ghost in the graveyard, roast marshmallows, sip hot cocoa and play dares! Other games you can play is 'I have never' which involves having all the lights out -and someone saying, for example: 'I have never...farted in public'. If you have, then you have to cough. This will make everyone giggle! Another idea, go into groups or pairs, and give each group or pair a toilet paper roll each - play mummies! You could race or have a fashion show!

, If you're going to have a barbecue, why not cook it on a campfire! Barbecues are excellent camping food, so this would really set the scene! For dessert , yummy treats like cookies and brownies are very tasty and fun to make! Breakfast can be really simple, like cereal, toast, fresh juice. Or if you're a bit ambitious, go for pancakes, or a fry up! Also, if you're serving tea quite late, serve up some dips to keep everyone going!

, Decorations can play a huge part in your camp out. They don't need to be big and expensive, but if you use some of these ideas, they could really set the scene. Why not try collecting empty glass jam jars and placing little candles in them. Arrange them around your garden and light them when its dark! This will really give your garden that magical look! Also, make your own bunting by cutting old, or cheap fabric into triangles (or any other shape) and stapling it to some string. A few banners here and there look festive and balloons are a must have. Why not cut out a flower shape and write all your guests names on the shape, then sellotape the shape to the ceiling of your tent!

, As well, your guests will feel more relaxed and willing to participate in your mad games! If you are a very shy person, try to practice simple things like opening a door to your guest and welcoming them in, in front of a mirror - it may sound silly, but it'll work. When your guests arrive, at least seem happy to see them, give them a hug (or do your handshake?!) and compliment their outfit, or their hair, or their tan (if they've been on holiday). Take their bags and thank the folks for bringing them. (It's probably best to keep most of the guests belongings inside, so you don't have to worry about people losing things, or belongings getting wet or mucky). Offer light food and a scrummy drink, like a smoothie or milkshake. These simple things will make your party so much more enjoyable!

, Sure, have a plan, but don't treat it like a school day and make sure everything on your list is done by the minute! If you feel your guests look bored or uncomfortable, play an icebreaker game or some music to relax even the shyest of guests!

Most families have a calendar where they write down events, appointments, etc. Try to find a day and time where the house will be empty. Avoid asking parents directly, because this may sound suspicious. Playing sick can also help you get the house to yourself if the whole family is going somewhere together, but this may backfire! The whole family may have to stay to ""take care"" of you.;
, If you want a large party, tell the people you invite to ""bring their friends"". If you want to keep it smaller, tell them so.

, Remove any objects that can be broken and put them in different rooms. If valuables of any kind are laying around, make sure you hide them as well.

,, If people are drinking, this will help them not get too clumsy. However, keep your guests away from alcohol.

,, Bring out the garbage bags and start dumping out beer cans and other garbage a little by little.

,, (Preferably ask them before the party, as a heads up and something to hold them to)

, No matter what, always do it the right after the party or the following day. Never procrastinate on this part.

, Too much trash can signal to what you were doing, either that or if the fridge is too empty.

, Sweep and mop the floor in your house.

,,, Examine the area for anything that you may have missed. Taking a photo on a camera/phone will help you fix things you might have missed but your parents would notice, check the photos often throughout clean up.

Get some TMNT themed decorations.,
Get a cake!,
Rent the latest TMNT movie(s) or watch the classics!,
Relax and enjoy the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fun!",How to Have a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Birthday Party," You can make TMNT themed invitations/emails. Example: (look at image) ""It's a TMNT sleepover!"" Make sure that your friends at least know who the TMNT are or like them. It'll be kind of awkward with them receiving the message or getting there and being like, ""Who the heck are they?!"";
, You can draw some pictures of your own or just print them off and tape them wherever you can! Go to Party City or another costume store and buy a costume of your favorite character. If you can't find one, you can order one online or make one of your own. (look some articles up on here :)

, Yummy...Go to your local bake shop (or wherever you can find a cake!) and order a TMNT cake. If you can't find one, ask someone that's talented with cake making or make it yourself!

, Maybe you have some of the old ones on DVD/Blueray, or maybe you can watch them on Youtube. Your party, your pick!

, All work and no play can really mess up a loyal fan (that's why they get so irritated and impatient while waiting for the newest movie/series to come out). Try to help your friends with having fun (if they're not used to this much Turtle partying)and try to explain the characters and plots during the movies if you've seen they before.

Decide where the party is.,
Decide on your guests.,
Clean your house, and clean yourself.,
Have good food and drinks.,
Be ready when your guests arrive.,
Have some boundaries.,
Go over the rules.,
Pick a time frame.,
Pick a day.",How to Have a Disco Diva Party," A good place is the basement because it's usually got lots of space, the lights can be dimmed, and there's an Air Hockey table!;
, Have a reasonable amount of space to fit all of your guests into. This will also determine on what types of games you could play.

, It's best to shower before the guests come, so that you look clean (and have the proof) also so you don't get bad comments. And if you clean your house, your guests think that you're prepared!

, It's best that you actually have food and drinks. Have about 3-5 drink choices, and 4-10 food choices. Make sure you ask your guests about any allergies. You must have non-nut foods and drinks at your party.

, How embarrassing would it be if your parents had to call you???

, You don't want your guests going into your bedroom without your permission, would you?

, When all of your guests arrive, go over the rules and boundaries so they don't trash the place.......

, When is your party going to start, and when it ends. For a disco party, the reasonable time is for about 6 hours. The party could start at 5:00pm and end at 10:00pm.

, If your party is going over-time, you should make the party a Friday or a Saturday night.

Practice dancing at home.,
Consider taking a contemporary dance class.,
Look your best.,
Get settled at the party.,
Listen to the music.,
Find a place to dance.,
Let your body move naturally to the music.,
Look like you're having fun.",How to Dance at Parties," Put on your favorite music, close your bedroom door, and dance like nobody's watching. Watch yourself dancing in front of the mirror, and pay attention to what moves look good and which ones don't. Even if you have no idea how to dance, practicing dancing at home will help your body's muscle memory kick in so that you can dance more naturally in front of others.


Do this at least once a week. Not only will you improve your skills, dancing is a great form of exercise!
Practice dancing to different kinds of music; hip-hop, electronic, classic rock, country and blues. This way you won't be thrown off when an unexpected song comes on.;
, Hip-hop and modern dance classes help you become more familiar with your body, and also teach you the essentials of rhythm and coordination.


You should also consider taking a dance aerobics class like Zumba if you are a member of a gym.

, Before going to a party, put on your favorite clothes and be sure to properly groom yourself so that you feel confident about the way you look. The more attractive you feel, the less self-conscious you will be about being watched by other people.


Be sure to wear comfortable clothes and shoes that you can actually move in. Clothes that are too tight can hold you back when dancing and make you look stiff.
Girls should consider wearing a loose, flowing dress or top that will give you some extra movement while dancing. Even if you just stand there awkwardly swaying your hips back and forth, the movement of your dress will look graceful.

, After arriving, take some time to do a lap around the party, say hi to your friends, and grab a drink. Soaking up your surroundings will help ease some of the nervousness you may feel and allow you to relax and have fun. If people are already dancing, then watch them for a moment and take some mental notes.


If you are old enough, then have a drink or two before dancing. It will help loosen you up and make you feel less self-conscious. Don't take it overboard though; drinking too much will have a reserve effect, and you'll feel embarrassed the next day.

, Before hitting the dance floor, pay attention to what kind of music is playing. Find the beat, and start bobbing your head to it. Keeping up with the beat of a song is a fundamental skill to dancing, and helps you determine how fast or slow to dance for a given song.

, If there is a group of people already dancing, then join them. Try to dance in the center of the group so that you're not as visible to people standing around on the outskirts.

, Don't try to do pre-rehearsed moves, and don't try to dance faster or slower than the music that's playing. You can start by taking one step out with your right foot, bringing it back in, and then doing the same with your left foot.


Keep your upper body and arms relaxed.
Continue bobbing your head to the music.
Don't lock your knees.
Close your eyes every now and again and just try to go with the flow!
If you are stuck, watch what other people are doing and imitate them. Don't stare and make it obvious, though!

, The only people who look silly while dancing are the ones who look uncomfortable or nervous. No matter how ridiculous your moves are, if you have a smile on your face and are laughing or singing along with the music, you will look cool. Guaranteed!

Find out when your parents are going out.,
Plan ahead.,
If you are usually going on vacation with your family, think of a good excuse to stay home.,
Remember, for a long-term party, or ""banger"", again, plan ahead, but instead of a couple of hours warning for a short-term party, make it at least a week since you know your parents will be gone at least a couple of days.

Follow every other step for a short-term party, except the drinking can be a little less strict as you can have your friends sleep over.

,
Just remember that you have to clean up before your parents get home, so put all breakable things away until after the banger has concluded.

,
Again, have fun, make memories, just don't do anything too stupid, like getting yourself killed.

,
Make sure you have a table of some sort for people to play beer pong.",How to Have a Party While Your Parents Are Out," But don't make it too obvious, or they'll be suspicious.;
, If you're looking for a long-term party (e.g. weekend ""banger"", or longer), wait until your family goes on vacation.

, Tell them you want to work more to save up money for a car or, if you're going off to college, just say that you're trying to hang out with your friends one last time before you never see them again.

,, Wipe up the bathroom counter with a paper towel once everyone is done.

, You can do each others hair in funky styles. Have a variety of rubber bands and hair clips present along with small, disposable hair combs.

, Technically, there should be about twenty different nail polishes. Varieties should include metallic (gleaming), non-metallic (dull) and glittering nail polish. Have cool colors, including sea foam green, red, blue, orange, pink, white, purple, rose, turquoise, violet-red, etc. Imagine how nice a sparkling, rich orange would look! You can buy small tubes of these polishes cheaply at any small store. Make sure you have plenty of cotton balls and nail polish remover.

, Take turns with the polishes. Start out by applying either a dull or gleaming layer of polish. You can plan out by having different colors for each nail. Make sure to include different shades of each color.

, Whether in the same color or in white, glitter adds it all! If you want to, then trim your nails, although long nails look good with polish.

, Take turns using the stickers, just stick them onto your nails and apply a clear coat of polish to fasten it on.

, Good ideas include pizza, pasta, chicken fingers, macaroni with cheese, etc.

, You can all take turns applying tattoos to each other. If you want to, try on make-up for pictures, but remember to wash it off before sleeping to stop pimples.

Check the App Store or Google Play.,
Look online.,
Search by DJ.,
Find friends to go with you.,
Ask around, if you know or see anyone around who you know goes to raves, ask them about them.,
Gather Fliers.,
Take action.,
Don't forget about the rave!",How to Find Raves," There are some good resources like RollRandom that will help you locate local raves and ravers.;
, This one can solve the problem very easily. There are raver message boards and forums online where you can obtain information about an upcoming rave near you. Try looking at a ravers message board, social networking site or a similar website. These can be very helpful in finding a nearby rave.

, Try finding out when your favorite DJ is in town on a tour. Check their website, also their Facebook or Myspace page if it exists(most DJ's have at least one). These pages usually say the dates and locations of any shows on their tour.

, If you can get a few friends excited about going to a show, you'll have more than just yourself searching for one. Two heads are better than one.

, A good start may be as simple as ""Hey I heard you were a good person to talk to about finding a rave nearby."" or ""Hey I'm trying to find out where the next rave is around here, have you heard anything?"" Much of the initial information about raves travels by mouth from raver to raver. Gossip is a great place to start.

, Many raves are heavily promoted at the previous rave. Once you find your way into one, it becomes exceedingly simple to find the next one. In fact, you may have more fliers than you bargained for by the end of the night.

, If you sit there and stare at the date without buying a ticket you could show up and find that it is sold out. Buy your tickets as early as possible and make sure you have enough for everyone in your group. Buying early can also get you a very good deal, as tickets cost more the closer the event is and are generally much more expensive at the door.

, It can be easy to buy your ticket so early and become burnt out on the excitement. If you stash your ticket in a drawer somewhere you may completely forget the rave is even happening in the months it can take to wait for it to arrive. Put your ticket somewhere you can see it, if you're worried about misplacing it and need to stash it away somewhere make sure you have some way of reminding yourself about the rave. A picture on the refrigerator or a countdown to the rave can help you remain as excited as the moment you saw that your favorite DJ was playing at a venue nearby.

Your budget is critical because once you create it, you’ll know what sort of stuff is possible and what isn’t.


Talk to your parents about how much they plan to spend on your birthday.
Add up any allowance savings or other money you might be able to use in throwing your birthday.;
, After you create your budget, you can move on and begin to formulate a preliminary invitation list. At its very core, the size and scope of your list – coupled with your budget – will determine the character of the party. When working on your list:


Create a list of must-have people. This is will include your best friends and your inner circle. Anyone you hang out with on a weekly basis should be on this list.
Add a secondary list of people you’d like to have. These are people in your larger friend circle. They might include classmates who have invited you to their home, friends you see somewhat often, and friends-of-friends that you find yourself hanging out with a lot.
Try to balance your budgetary limitations with the fact that some people’s feelings might get hurt if you don’t invite them to your party., Once you have your budget and a preliminary invitation list, you’ll be better able to pick the general location where you want to celebrate your birthday.


If your budget is low and you have a large invitation list, you may want to have your party at home.
If you have a small budget and a small list, you may be able to shop around for venues outside your home to have your birthday.
Parties at home can be traditional or they can be different. Remember, you don’t need to have an 8-year old style birthday with a cake and games. You can turn your birthday celebration into anything you want., Your fourteenth birthday party may be one of your last opportunities to host a sleepover party at your house. For many teenagers, late high school signals the end of these parties. As a result, use your fourteenth celebration as a final slumber party.


Provide dinner and snacks.
Play games.
Watch movies., There are a wide variety of different amusements that you and your friends can enjoy for your birthday celebration. Ultimately, visiting an amusement park will make a fun and memorable party.


Attend a local county fair.
If you live in the proximity of a major park like Six Flags, Disney, or something similar, take a few of your best friends to the park for a day.
Go roller skating, ice skating, or bowling.

, If you're really into sports, you may want to take a few of your friends to see your favorite sports team. This way, you'll be able to spend time with your best friends while watching your favorite team.


Consider your favorite local baseball, football, hockey, or soccer team.
You may also want to consider organizing a sporting event that your friends can participate in, like a baseball game.

, By watching a movie with your friends, you'll be able to have a fun, yet, low-key birthday celebration. Your party will also be relatively inexpensive, depending on where you want to watch the movie.


Consider watching a movie at home with your friends. You can supply popcorn, soft drinks, and even turn the day into a double feature movie day.
Take a few of your best friends to a movie theatre to watch the newest blockbuster., Eating at your favorite restaurant is also another great low-key way to celebrate your party. Not only do you get to enjoy your favorite food, but you get to spend time with your best friends.


Think about your favorite pizza or hamburger place.
Consider ethnic foods like Chinese, Thai, or Mexican.
If you have the funds, consider combining your dining plans with a movie or something else fun., While low-key options may be tempting, you might also be interested in throwing a large birthday celebration. By having a large party, you'll be able to invite many more friends than you would if you had a smaller gathering. Think about having a:


Beach party
Hawaiian party
Hollywood party

Spa party (at home or at a professional spa)
Makeover party

Dance party (at your house or a community center)., The date you want to celebrate your 14th birthday party is critical in making sure your celebration is a success. This is because the date will determine what sorts of activities you can do and who can come.


While you may want to pick the exact date of your birthday, it might be inconvenient for a lot of your guests. For example, if your birthday is on a Friday, you may want to postpone the celebration to Saturday.
To make sure it does not clash with other important events that you and your friends may need to attend, like a baseball game at school.
To avoid major holidays. While you may be tempted to hold your birthday on Halloween, some of your friends may have already made other plans.

, The venue is the specific place you intend to hold your 14th birthday celebration. Choosing a venue is important as you’ll need to decide early and book as soon as you are sure that’s where you want to hold your celebration.


Inquire about pricing and availability. Talk to the manager of the venue about whether they have other groups booked that day and how much the party would cost.
Book the venue with enough time in advance. Some places, like country clubs or pavilions at beaches may book up weeks ahead of time.
Consider a backup venue., After deciding on your date and venue, you need to make sure you’ll have appropriate entertainment for your celebration. Depending on the theme, location, and other factors, entertainment may vary. Consider:


If you’re having a small get-together at home, you may just want to rely on board games, videogames, and movies.
If you have a big budget, you might hire a band, disc jockey, or another type of entertainer.
Some venues will necessarily include entertainment, for example, if you’re having your birthday at a bowling alley or a paintball park, you won’t need to worry about entertainment., Once you’ve planned all the details of your party, you’ll need to send out invitations. Make sure not to put this off, as people will need to reserve the date and time of your party.


Include the date, time, location, and any relevant information your guests will need. For example, if your party is a pool party, let them know they’ll need to bring a bathing suit and a towel.
Give plenty of notice to the people you plan to invite. In most cases, you should give at least two weeks notice.
If you’re planning a last-minute party, you should call your friends directly and let them know., After you send out invitations, you’ll need to purchase all the supplies for your party. Ultimately, the supplies you need will vary depending on the theme, venue, and more.


Parties at your home will require you to purchase a lot of items. You’ll need food, drinks, plasticware, and decorations.
Parties at country clubs or similar venues may require you to have less. Ultimately, though, you’ll probably have to buy decorations.
The management of ice skating rinks, arcades, and laser tag studios may supply food, drinks, and minimal decorations. Contact your venue to see what they supply. , During the day before or morning of the event, you’ll have to decorate. Setting aside time for decorating is very important, as it’ll help set the tone of your celebration.


If you’re having your party at home, consider doing some of the decorating the day before. This might include putting up signs, balloons, and any theme-related decorations.
If you’re having a party at a venue other than your home, you may only have an hour or even less before your party to decorate. Because of this, it’s very important to get some volunteers to help you set everything up before the party begins."

Release the kid in you.,
Consider a quiet party.,
Invite a manageable number of people.,
Think up a theme.,
Set up the entertainment for the night.,
Warn the neighbors.",How to Celebrate an 18th Birthday1," Why not invite some friends over and have a birthday party? Hang streamers, balloons, eat cake, play games and watch movies! Just because you are now considered an ""adult"" by law, does not mean you lose your youth. Enjoy the time with people you love. If you want to have a more ""adult"" 18th birthday party, there are also plenty of ways to celebrate your new-found freedom.;
, Some people don't require a big blow-out when they turn 18. Spending a few quiet hours at home with your family? Opening presents? Eating cake? If it worked for 17 years, nothing needs to change now. Spend time with the people who love you and relax.

Make it quality time. Organize some spa time with a sibling or parent, or spend time working on cars with your dad. Do something you'd normally do, but take the time to really appreciate it. Most people assume that turning 18 means that these moments will start to dissipate, but that isn't entirely true. You can make them last, even if you start taking on new responsibilities.
Make a list of the childhood things you'd like to do, and use your 18th as an opportunity to do all of the things you've always loved doing. Hang out with your brother and watch samurai movies late, or go to your favorite ice cream spot with the family. Remember, turning 18 has more responsibilities, but you don't have to stop being a kid.
Try a less common party activity, like camping. You can do this at a park with camping spots, or even in your own backyard. Grab a tent, some snacks, some video games, and a few good friends! It's like an all night hangout but without your parent's over your shoulder. If you want to camp in a park, tent spots are usually about $15 a night, give or take. This can be a great way to bond with your friends while also tasting freedom away from your parents.

, One good way of celebrating an 18th is throwing a house party for yourself. Depending on the house you've got available, you may want to have a big throw-down or a smaller gathering appropriate for your purposes. Whatever you want to do, make sure you invite an appropriate number of people so you won't have a big crowd spilling onto your lawn and attracting cops.


If you talk about your party on Facebook or other social networking, keep it to private messages. Don't post about your party publicly, or you may have unwanted guests and attention.
Consider celebrating multiple 18ths at the same time. If a couple friends are all turning 18, mash up all your parties together to get one big throw-down, rather than a few smaller parties. Think epic.

, Set up your party with a style that suits your theme, or your own personal taste. You could keep it elegant and tasteful with some nice flower arrangements, photos, and crepe, or you could do it up with a smoke machine, disco ball, and a trap DJ for a grimy dance party. Maybe you want mason jars full of lemonade, a bluegrass band, and hay bales. Decide what kind of vibe you want for your part and go with it.


Quick tip: change your light bulbs from the standard white to red or yellow and set the tone to the house party quickly, cleanly, and cheaply.
Prepare your house properly by tucking away all your valuables and things that may get knocked over. Place them in a lockable room, or move things into the garage or a shed.
Think about clean-up. If you've got to start scrubbing goo off the floor after the jello-wrestling tank overflowed, you might have a bad start to your 18th year. try to keep it manageable.

, It's important to have something for your guests to do at your party. This could be anything from games to dancing to movies to cooking. It's your night, so pick something that you will enjoy doing with your closest friends.


Choose something that you and your friends will enjoy doing. If you're a gamer, set up a video game gauntlet and move from room to room in an epic circuit. Super Nintendo in the Attic and Xbox One in the living room. Game your way from floor to floor.
If you want to hire a DJ, remember to give them a list of songs to play that you like and your guests will appreciate. As your guests arrive you can always have them write down two or three of their favorite dancing songs and this will ensure they get up and get the party started.
If you go with a live band, it's essential that you make sure they'll have enough room, electrical hook-ups, and other materials necessary to play, especially if you're going to pay for it. Make sure they're there early to set up.

, Nothing ruins a party faster than a call to the cops and a knock on the door. It's common courtesy to warn your neighbors that you're going to have a party and let them know the specific details. Go around the neighborhood to make sure you'll be in the clear.


Pro tip: Don't treat it so much like a warning and treat it more like an invitation. Tell the neighbors you're going to have a party for your 18th and that you wanted to let them know they should stop by. Slide a little caveat in there: ""Not expecting too many people, but there'll probably be some music. We'll try to have it over with at a reasonable hour. Hope to see you there!""

Pick an appropriate swimsuit.,
Wear the right shoes.,
Add some layers.",How to Dress for a Pool Party (Girls)1," Appropriate is actually referring to whatever makes you feel the most comfortable. Whether it’s a bikini or a one-piece; choose a suit, which you feel comfortable wearing.


You don’t want to spend the entire pool party tugging at your suit or trying to find a place to hide in embarrassment, so choose a style of suit that makes you feel confident.
A swimsuit can also serve as your statement piece, so pick a design that says something about you.For example, if you love animal print, choose a leopard bikini. If you're a bit of a hippy at heart, try something with fringe. There are many ways you can express yourself through your swimsuit, so have fun with it.
Keep in mind that the suit should also align with the type of pool party. For example, if there are kids at the event, you may want to reconsider wearing an extremely revealing suit.;
, Tennis shoes probably aren’t the best choice for a pool party, as they could get wet.Opt for a pair of sandals instead.


Shoes that have a good grip are preferable. You don't want to be slipping and sliding around the pool as you socialize.
Avoid wearing wedges. They may look cute, but they aren’t practical for a pool party. Platform sandals may work better as they are sturdier and slip on and off easier.A strappy sandal with a low heel is always a good choice, as they are fairly easy to get on and off and can add a lot to your style. For example, if you're keeping it fairly basic with a black suit and sundress, try wearing a pair of strappy sandals with rhinestone embellishments.

, Layers can help set you apart, keep you warm as the sun sets and cover areas that you feel self-conscious about. Make sure the layers are lightweight though, so that they can be removed easily and dry quickly.Try wearing a floral sarong or a maxi dress over your swimsuit. For a more casual look, consider a bright, lightweight t-shirt or tank top with shorts.
Kaftan's are particularly popular right now. Choose one that is see through and can be worn like a jacket, with an opening in the front, for a more chic look.
Bright colors and bold patterns are a safe bet for pool parties, while dark colors and jeans should be avoided.

Only invite a selected number of friends.,
Find an over-18 club.,
Get a ride from place to place.,
Take lots of pictures.,
Have fun, but stay safe.",How to Celebrate an 18th Birthday2," 18 is a huge milestone, so grab some friends and make a night of it. Try to keep your group to a wolf-pack sized crew–no more than five or so, close friends–and hit the town. If you go out, always travel in a group.


Make reservations if you've got a big party to make sure you'll get into the restaurant, club, or other venue you want to get into. If it requires tickets, buy tickets ahead of time. If it requires a cover charge, make sure everyone's got cash.
Depending on when you turn 18, this might be one of the last chances you have to catch up with your close friends before college, or before jobs start. It might be fun to head to a loud dance club, but it might also be fun to just hang out quietly and talk. Do what feels natural.

, If your town has one, finding an 18-and-over club can be a great way to explore the town and have some fun. Theses types of clubs are usually like most dance venues, but without alcohol. Lots of venues will have 18 listed as the minimum age, and if there's an event that happens around your birthday, it can be a great way to celebrate.


While it might be fun for you, also try to plan on underage members of your group. Don't make plans to go anywhere that everyone can't go, or just invite people who are over-18. Do a little planning to make sure nobody will be left out.

, Before you head out, make sure you know how you'll get from place to place and that you've got your rides arranged. Best to let someone else drive, especially if you're going to be drinking at all, but even if you're not. Taking away the stress of driving around can make the whole evening a lot easier and more fun.


Taking a cab is a safe bet, or arranging rides with family members or other close friends, but if you want to make your 18th epic, there's always the possibility of a limo.
If your town has access, using Lyft or Uber is a great way of getting from place to place. You can arrange to have a car meet you somewhere at a specific time.

, In a couple years, you'll definitely want to make sure that you documented your 18th. It's easier than ever these days, but don't forget to snap enough group pictures to keep track of everything you do this night. The pictures will be priceless.

, Your 18th should be a night of freedom and fun, but if you're going out you need to be extremely safe. Always stay in a group, make sure everyone's exchanged numbers before you go out, and let your parents or someone else close to you know where you're planning on going and what you're planning on doing. Make sure you start your birthday out on the right foot.

Figure out what's newly legal in your area.,
Buy a lotto ticket.,
Consider a birthday tattoo.,
Register to vote.",How to Celebrate an 18th Birthday3," Depending on where you live, there may be a whole host of newly legal things for you to try to explore as a freshly-minted adult. Whether you're planning a party for someone who's about to turn 18 or planning your own get-together, it's common for it to include some kind of thing you couldn't do when you were 17.


In some countries, 18 is the legal drinking age. If you're going to have a few drinks to celebrate, make sure you drink safely and don't test your limits. You've got a whole lifetime of legal drinking ahead of you. No need to cram it in all at once.
Lottery tickets, tattoos, tobacco products, marriage licenses, military enlistment, and voter registration are all things that 18-year-olds suddenly have at their disposal in most areas. Learn what's available in yours and plan to celebrate like an adult.
In many areas, turning 18 means you have to get a new driver's license or ID card. In some states and provinces, it's a different color, with different designations. While it might not be a fun way to celebrate, it's a good idea to get your new ID as soon as possible.

, One of the first things lots of 18 year-olds do is buy up a lottery ticket or two. It can be a fast and fun way to do something with your new ID and your new adulthood. Buy up a scratch-off or a power ball card and have some harmless fun. Who knows, you might even win a little folding money to help fund your party.

, 18-year-olds don't need parental consent to get a tattoo legally. While it's not necessarily recommended that you get a tattoo just because you can, if you've been settled on a design for a long time and are really serious about getting one, it's a common way of celebrating your birthday. Research a good artist in your area, have a meet up to talk about your design, and schedule an appointment for your 18th.

, Yeah, yeah, it's not the stuff of parties, but spending the pre-party portion of your day doing newly adult things might be an exciting and fun way to celebrate. Exercise your rights by registering to vote in your area, so you'll be ready by the time the next election comes along.

Style your hair.,
Add accessories.,
Don’t forget sunglasses.",How to Dress for a Pool Party (Girls)2," When it comes to your hair, keep it fairly simple. You’ll be getting wet so don’t spend a lot of time styling your hair.


An easy styling tip for your hair is the night before the party wash your hair. Then, while it's still damp, spritz on a bit of detangler and put it into a single braid (you can try multiple braids, too). In the morning, undo the braid(s) and you'll have beachy waves, which are perfect for a pool party!
You may also want to keep your hair in a loose braid at the party. This is particularly useful if your hair is already wet after being in the pool. You can quickly braid it and once it has dried, can let it loose as the night wears on.

, Everyone can benefit from adding a few accessories to their pool style. Try a stylish hat, which will not only provide extra protection from the sun, but will look cute as well. A few pieces of jewelry is acceptable, but don’t overdo it, as you still want to be able to enjoy the pool without being weighed down.


Don’t wear any jewelry that is overly expensive, as you’re at risk of losing it while in the pool.
Floppy hats are not only stylish, but practical for keeping the sun off your face.
Sunscreen is an important accessory. Consider bringing a matching bag to hold your sunscreen and other accessories when you’re in the pool.

, Although sunglasses are an accessory, they are such a major part of your pool party style, that they deserve to be in their own category. Sunglasses provide protection, while making a statement.


Try to match your sunglasses with what you’re wearing. For example, if you’re wearing gold jewelry, try finding some gold rimmed sunglasses to wear as well.
Pair sunglasses with a hat for added protection and a stylish look.

Keep your makeup to a minimum.,
Don’t forget lip gloss.,
Wear waterproof mascara.",How to Dress for a Pool Party (Girls)3," There’s no need to wear a lot of a makeup, as you’ll be getting wet, so try to keep it simple and light. This means you should ditch the foundation and blush for the day, as you don't want to appear streaky or get makeup everywhere.


If you'd like to wear eye shadow, be sure to buy the waterproof kind. It comes in tube that resembles lipstick and can easily be applied after you've been in the pool.For any bags under you eyes, look for a waterproof under eye concealer. Keep in mind though, that a great pair of sunglasses goes a long way in concealing the bags under your eyes too!

, Lip gloss is a simple and easy way to add a bit of color to your lips without going overboard.


If you don't plan on getting in the pool, feel free to try a bold lip color, such as red. However, if you'll be enjoying the festivities both in and out of the water, buy a waterproof lipgloss. There are brands, which make lipgloss that lasts for up to 12 hours, despite being exposed to small amounts of water.

, When it comes to pool party makeup, waterproof mascara is a must. Always invest in a good, waterproof mascara. The last thing you want is to have raccoon eyes.


Consider using a waterproof mascara that will also make your eyelashes appear thicker. You can also use two coats to add some extra volume.
Apply your mascara before going to the party so that it has time to dry before you get into the water.

First of all figure out where she is on the dance floor, if she is more in the middle, wait until she goes for a break like water or something.,
Once you found her little area, stay close to her until a song starts.,
Consider the speed


If it's a slow song, look her in the eyes and ask her if she would like to dance (E.g.,
If she says yes, you did it!,
After the song if she keeps dancing, go with it, don't walk away!

",How to Get a Dance with the Girl You Like in Middle School," Do not follow her! It will seem weird and stalkerish, just wait until she comes back in and then find out where she is going (e.g. back in the middle, sides, front etc.);
, She might get taken.

, ""hey, wanna dance?"" or ""mind if I dance with you?"") if she says no, don't be discouraged! Keep being friendly with her, and let it go.
If it's a fast song, you got to be quick! Ask her if she wants to dance but don't drag it out like , ""May I have this dance with you?""

, Hold just above her hips, that way its not too low or too high. Don't hold too tight. also, don't hold her too softly! If you do she will think you are insecure or scared and/or not confident! Girls like confident guys!

Choose the dress that you love and you feel the most confident and comfortable in.;
, Traditionally, guys wear tuxedos or suits to formal dances. A formal that is considered a black tie event usually means you should wear a tux. You should only wear a tux for an evening event. A suit is more casual and is considered appropriate for day time or night time occasions. Tuxedos are more expensive than suits, but you can rent one if you just need it for one evening. , Don’t dye your hair right before formal because you never know what could go wrong. You will want time to fix any mistakes, so dye your hair weeks in advance. Don’t cut your hair too close to the day of the dance, especially don’t do anything drastic the day of.

, The weeks leading up to the dance look at hair styles online that you think you can do yourself.

Make sure to prime your face, eyes, and lips and use a setting spray to keep everything in place. You don’t want your makeup melting off of your face when you start dancing.
Use a foundation that is specifically for photos (you can find this at any makeup or drug store), since there will be a lot of memories being captured at formal. Make sure to blend your foundation well and have it match your skin tone. , If you don’t think you can get the look you want on your own, make appointments. You can make a hair appointment at a salon, makeup appointment with a makeup artist, and a nail appointment at a nail salon. Weeks before the event schedule the appointments, otherwise everything might be booked. This option is costlier than doing your hair and makeup yourself. , You don’t need a date for a formal dance, but if you want one start figuring out who you might want to take in advance. If you don’t have a significant other, think about a friend you could ask to go with you as your date or who you think might ask you. Choose someone who you think you will have fun with and who will make sure you have a great night.


Ask your friends for help to find you the perfect date.
Ask someone yourself if nobody has asked you. The worse thing that can happen is that they say no. , You don’t need a date to have a great time at formal, going with your friends can be more fun for a lot of reasons. Going with your friends instead of a date means there is no stress about if you and your date are going to have fun and click. You can feel comfortable being yourself and dancing how you want. Without a date, you can dance with whoever you want. After the dance you can spend time with your friends and not worry about any pressure from your date to hang out. , Whether you go with just your friends or with a date, go to the dance in a group. Plan your group a few weeks before the dance. Ask your friends, your dates’ friends, and their dates if they want to go to the formal together. You can do the pre-formal and post-formal activities together to make your formal experience even more fun.

, Once you have your formal group determined you can decide where you want to take photos before the formal. There are many different places you can take the photos: a backyard, rooftop, bridge, staircase, beach, lake, or garden are popular places. . Decide who you want to take the photos. Parent’s typically love to take photos or if you want, and have the budget, you can hire a professional photographer.

, Have dinner somewhere that everyone in your group likes before formal. The restaurant should be near where the formal is located. Once everyone has agreed on a place, make reservations ahead of time because the popular restaurants fill up quickly.

, There are many options for getting to formal, depending on your budget. Your group can all go in on a limo or party bus if you have a big enough budget. You can drive yourselves if you have enough cars. If you live somewhere where shared ride services are available, such as Uber or Lyft, you can use that to get to formal.

Freshen up!,
When you get out of the shower, wrap a towel on your head.,
Hair time!,
Put on your outfit!,
If you happen to have acne, after taking a shower is the time to put on any acne creams and treatments that prevent, well, acne.,
Makeup time!,
Seal your makeup with makeup sealer.

,
Put on more deodorant, just to be sure.,
If you want to pack your purse, put some stuff in, such as your feminine things, a small bottle of perfume, travel-sized deodorant, some makeup for touch-ups, your phone (if you have one), a pack of minty gum for fresh breath (no one likes hot, stinky breath!,
Shave your legs!,
Go have fun!",How to Get Ready for a Dance (Girls)," Take a nice, cool shower, and use shampoo that will make your hair have lots of volume and shine. Use a body wash that will keep your skin smooth, soft, and refreshed. It is also good if the body wash is scented, perhaps something flowery or whatever your favorite scent is.;
, While you're waiting for your hair to dry partially, brush your teeth well, pluck your eyebrows (if you know how to. If not, go to a salon and have a professional do it, or you might mess up your pretty brows, which is not good), clip, buffer, and file your nails, moisturize and soften your skin with lotion, put on good and long-lasting deodorant, paint your nails, etc.

, When you are done with that your hair will still be damp, put in shine enhancer, and blow dry it. I recommend using an anti-frizz hair spray to prevent your hair getting frizzy when you're dancing, such as John Freida Anti-frizz.Then style it in any way you want! You can these hairstyles:


Regular braid
Fishtail braid
Curls (wavy or make it curlier)
Straightened
A nice and pretty bun (make it messy or ballerina or however you want it, as long as it depicts the theme).
A pretty hairstyle of your own invention!

, Put a bathrobe over this so that you don't get makeup on your clothes.

, Use brand products like the well-known Proactiv and Neutrogena. But do not apply too much acne treatment. Too much of it will give you massive breakouts and you do not want that; You're trying to do the other way around!

, If you're dancing with a guy, he would like to be with a girl with a natural look, not a clownish, fake mask!


Put on foundation. Blend well including your neck, and dust some powder over your face
Put on eyeliner that's not too heavy-looking. Make the line thin or medium sized, perhaps adding a wing on the corner of your eyes.
Eye shadow that matches your outfit and your overall makeup (e.g. bold lipstick = lighter eye shadow)
Blush to keep your cheeks at a beautiful, rosy flush. Don't put too much blush!
Mascara - several swipes would do. Don't cake your lashes with them though! Just enough to add volume and length to your lashes.
Lips - If you choose to wear lipstick, make sure it looks good. For example, if you choose a bold lipstick, make sure your eye shadow is lighter. Preferably for a dance, a light, rosy color is best. Add some lip gloss (optional).

,, Plus, use perfume! Spritz it lightly on your neck, elbows, wrist, and yes, behind your knee. These are the places where the perfume would last longer. Do not drown yourself in perfume or else people can smell you several states away!

,).

, Shaved legs and armpits are a must, unless, of course, you're not allowed to shave yet.

, This is your night, after all!

Think about the time and location of the party.,
Consider your own personal style.,
Think about your budget.,
Choose your jewelry.,
Match or clash your shoes and purse.,
Do something unique.",How to Dress up for a Party1," As all girls know, choosing the right outfit for a party is a very important task. The first thing you need to consider is the time and location of the party, as this will affect everything -- from your clothes and your shoes to your jewelry and makeup!


If the party is during the day, at a bowling alley or theme park, you probably want to go with something comfortable yet cool, like jeans and a statement tee.
If the party is at night, in a fancy restaurant or club, you will probably need to go a little dressier and wear something like a cute dress, a playsuit or a skirt and top combo.;
, When you're attending a cool party, you want to stand out -- but in a good way.


So if you want to be unique, you should come up with a cool alternative to the norm that suits your personality but still fits with the vibe of the party.
For example, if you're not the type of girl who would normally wear high heels, but you still want to look glam, you could try wearing a pair of bejewelled sneakers instead!

, Can you afford to buy a new outfit, or do you need to work with what's already in your wardrobe?


If it's the latter, consider combining your existing clothes in new and unusual ways, try layering a couple of tops on top of each other, clashing non-matching patterns or combining unusual fabric -- like a black biker jacket with a pretty silk dress.

, When it comes to jewelry, decide whether you want to go understated and classic, or bold and over-the-top.


For elegant evening parties, things like delicate diamond (or crystal) earrings and pearl necklaces are perfect.
For night parties, you can go with bold statement pieces, clash chunky gold and silver chains, or wear large hoop or chandelier earrings.

, Traditionally, women matched their shoes to their purse, but this is no longer the case -- nowadays, pretty much anything goes!


You can either pick out a color from your outfit (it doesn't have to be the main color) and match your shoes and purse to that, or you can go for a bold color clash.
For example, if you're wearing a plain black dress, something like gold shoes and a neon orange handbag could work really well.

, After you've taken care of the shoes, the purse and the jewelry, any other accessories you choose to wear are really a matter of personal preference.


Consider wearing a boho headband, embellishing your hair with fresh flowers, wearing an anklet or an upper arm band, layering on a chunky belt or rocking a funky trilby hat -- it's completely up to you!

"
"
Do your own hair.,
See a stylist.,
Plan your make up.,
Create a flawless base.,
Add color.,
Focus on the eyes.",How to Dress up for a Party2," Your hair is probably the next most important thing besides your outfit. Whatever style you end up going for, make sure your hair is freshly washed, so it is easy to work with and smells nice and clean.



Keep things simple. If you want to keep things easy, try straightening your hair with the flat iron for a simple, sleek look, or try curling it with a curling wand to achieve glamorous, loose waves or pretty, tight ringlets.

Try an updo. If you want an updo, consider trying a classic French twist, an elegant sock bun or a chic braided updo.

Experiment with braids: If braids are more your thing, try a French braid, a fishtail braid or braided headband.

, If you have the money, you could consider going to the hair salon and getting them to blow dry, curl or style your hair.


You could even try a new color or an interesting new cut, like a side fringe, a pixie cut or a bob!
However, if it's a birthday party you're going to be careful -- you don't want to upstage the birthday girl with your new 'do!

, Make up is the next thing you need to think about -- it's amazing the variety of different party looks your can create! Again, you need to think about the time and location of the party.


Daytime and outdoor parties will require more of a toned-down look, elegant evening parties can be glamorous and elegant, while fun, crazy night-time parties can be crazy and colorful!

, The first thing your need to think about is your base.


Make sure your skin is clean and well-hydrated, then apply some primer to give you a flawless base.
Use concealer to cover up any blemishes, then apply a foundation that perfectly matches your natural skin tone.

, Choose your eyeshadow, blush and lipstick colors based on the type of party.


Toned-down, nude colors are best for during the day, while smokey eyes and red lips work nicely for glamorous evening looks.
Pretty much anything goes at night! Try bright pink or dark purple lips, neon eyeshadows and glittery mascaras.

, Two make up tasks that girls most often have issue with are eyeliner and mascara application.


See this tutorial on how to do perfect winged eyeliner and this this tutorial on the correct way to apply mascara. If you're feeling really adventurous, you could even apply false eyelashes!
Also, don't forget to tidy up your eyebrows and fill them in with a little pencil -- this can really sharpen your look!

"
"
Take care of your skin.,
Do any necessary de-fuzzing.,
Smell delicious.,
Take care of your dental hygiene.",How to Dress up for a Party3," Exfoliate your skin in the shower with a loofah or an exfoliating glove.


This will get rid of any dead skin and leave your body feeling soft and smooth.
Once you're out of the shower, apply a scented moisturizing lotion that leaves you feeling and smelling great -- choose one with a slight shimmer if you really want to get in on the party vibe!

, This is especially important if you're wearing a skirt or a sleeveless top.


You can shave using a razor and shaving cream (but be careful not to cut yourself!), remove hair using a depilatory cream, or try waxing.
It is recommended that you book an appointment at a professional waxing salon if you have never done tried at-home waxing before.

, Make sure you smell great throughout the entire duration of the party by rubbing on a little antiperspirant deodorant and some perfume.


Apply the perfume to your pulse points -- the inside of your wrists, behind your ears, the inside of your thighs and between your breasts -- for the most long-lasting results.

, Floss, brush your teeth and rinse your mouth out with some mouthwash to leave your breath smelling fresh.


This should be the last thing you do before you leave -- try not to do any snacking before you get to the party!
You should also consider packing some mints or gum in your purse, so you can freshen up when necessary.

Have Fun!",How to Dress for a School Dance or Party (girls)," If your at prom, you won't wear jeans and a shirt. On the other hand, you wouldn't go full glitz and glam at a small fundraiser party. Look at flyers, posters, or ask a school official what would be appropriate for the party.;
, Bracelets, rings, necklaces are good if that's your kind of thing. If not, go for a natural look. A watch is not recommended but there are some really fashionable watches out there.

, There are many hairstyles out there, so experiment to see which one works for you and goes with your outfit.


Bring a little bag which has some 'emergency' stuff in it. This includes a spare hair band or bow for bad hair days. A small roll-on anti-persipant deodorant. If you want you could also bring breath-spray and lip-balm, just in case you and your partner kiss(or if you just don't want bad breath)!

, Shoes you know are comfy-cute but don't wear too often are a prime choice.


Wear something that is comfortable and cute. A pair of heels can give painful blisters that will make you sit on one of the corner chairs watching everyone dancing and having a lot of fun.
Remember socks and sandals are a total no-go.

, Go more colorful then usual (eye make-up vs. a little eyeliner for school). Or wear that new lipstick you've been planning for something special. Of course, the dance area is probably dark, so putting more effort in your outfit and going natural with make-up is another way to go. Remember that nobody finds a cake face attractive, so don't overdo it.


A good choice is some concealer, (that matches your skin tone!) eyeliner and a lipstick or lipgloss. NO MORE! Also make sure the makeup matches your outfit. For example a emerald-green dress and emerald-green eyeliner is a great match!

, Let it all out! You've probably been waiting to get all that energy out because you will get in trouble in class. But this isn't a classroom! Be yourself! Don't try to be somebody you're not. If you're a little shy, get together with your friends and dance together. It's a school dance! There's probably going to be some people there who are dancing all out. Do the same! Just don't go overboard.


Who says you can't have that really sugary slush? Or some of them nachos coated in cheese sauce? A school dance is not a school dance without the food! Who cares if you have a bit of chocolate? Nobody...apart from yourself!
If you plan on kissing someone stay away from strong smelling or sticky foods, especially anything that contains garlic.
Bring some mint or chewing gum to freshen your breath up after eating.

Choose the person who feels right to you rather than trying to match someone with specific height, hair and behavior requirements., There may be several things you would really want from your potential date, but you should focus on the things you need from them. Needs really can’t be replaced or ignored. On the other hand, wants can be negotiated and even surprise you on occasion by showing that what this person has to offer is actually more interesting or attractive.Curiosity can be better than book smarts. A curious person will want to know more about you and the world at large. Their intelligence will always be growing as they explore and learn.
Someone may not be the most beautiful person, but this may have allowed them room to be far more caring than someone who is deemed attractive by everyone.

, One of the best ways to find someone with similar interests is to immerse yourself in the things you love. Get out and do what you like, then look around and see who else is doing the same. These are your people. Mingle and see if you can find just the right person for the dance.It can be nice to meet someone outside of school where everyone knows everyone else and has already made assumptions about the other person. Meeting someone in a new setting allows you to see them for who they are rather than their reputation.
Join a club. Whatever it is that you love, there is likely a group of people who love it just as much. Find a club and join it, whether that be a book club, drama club, running, art, chess, or gamers. Whatever it is, ask around or get online and join.
Volunteer in your community. Whether you want to help animals, people, or politicians, invest some of your time into your community. This is one of the best ways to find other people with big hearts who could be your perfect match for the dance., You will be spending a majority of the evening with this person. The dance will be much more comfortable if you already know that you have a lot in common, things to talk about, and can hang out for a while.


If you have a friend you have started developing feelings for, this could be a perfect opportunity to let that person know. Make it clear that you would like to go as a date as opposed to just friends.

, Someone else may be more popular or considered cool. Your friends could be pressuring you to ask someone you are not comfortable asking out. You are going to be more comfortable and happier with someone you really want to be with at the dance.

, If you still think that girls expressing their feelings first and asking boys out is taboo, it’s time you get over it. This doesn’t make a girl dirty or wild or even inappropriate. It actually makes the girl really cool and confident.Even though the guy may be a little surprised and unsure how to react at first, he will most likely also be flattered.
In the off-chance that the guy you ask is totally weirded out, walk away. This is not the person you want to go to the dance with.

, This goes for girls asking girls to the dance as well. Same sex relationships may be a little more challenging to approach, but are becoming more accepted overall. If this is the person you want to ask, you should be free to do so.Consider speaking to your parents about your feelings if you have not already discussed your sexuality with them. This can alleviate added stress if your date says yes. Reference this article for tips on having this conversation with your family.
If you feel unsafe at your school, consider asking your date to a more private event on the night of the dance. Go to dinner and dance in the parking lot to your car radio. Consider also talking to your school counselor or administration about feeling unsafe at school.

, Think outside the romantic box for this one. Choose someone who would really appreciate you asking them to the dance. It doesn’t have to be a romantic date, but could still be really special.


A boy in South Dakota took his terminally ill sister to the dance, so she would not have to miss out on that experience in her life.Consider going with someone from your family, a good family friend, or someone you know and like, but no one is asking them to the dance.
One guy couldn’t find a date, so he took his cat! That might seem pretty weird, but he had a great time and got a lot of attention at the dance., This could be someone in your gender preference or not. This could be one person or a group of people. Any way you go about it, you will still get to go to the dance, you won’t miss out on anything, and you are guaranteed to have a good time.Friend dates are a great way to relieve the pressure of finding a romantic date to the dance.
You may be surprised how many other people at the dance also don’t have dates.

, You will want to begin by feeling like you are going to succeed. Do your best planning to get the best results. Even if you don’t get the answer you were looking for, you will know that you put forth your best effort.Wear something that makes you feel good.
Plan out what you are going to say and attempt to imagine the response so that you know how to handle it. Try having imaginary conversations in your head before you have them out loud.

, You don’t have to say, “Will you go to the dance with me?” then hope for the best. Come up with a unique way of popping this question so they will notice the effort you put into it.Make a treasure map or scavenger hunt which ends with you or a note asking them to the dance.
Leave flowers or flower petals on the windshield of their car with a note.
Put a fortune in a fortune cookie to let this person know how fortunate you would feel to go to the dance with them.
Go to a “Build a Bear” workshop and record a message that the bear can play back.

, If the pressure is really getting to you and you can't seem to bring yourself to talk to the person you would like to ask to the dance, write it out in a note and leave it in the person's locker or on the windshield of their car.


Give them an easy way to follow up. Leave your phone number and ask them to text you an answer, or even have ""yes/no"" boxes in the note.
Leaving the note could be tricky, because you may not know if they get it. If you can gather your confidence enough to hand it to them, you will know for sure that they got the note.

, It’s time to go figure out what you are going to wear. Actually though, let them know how excited you are. Keep in touch leading up to the dance. Communicate about your expectations and even your outfit so that you will both be comfortable the night of the dance.

, Just because one person has not accepted your invitation, does not mean that no one wants to go to the dance with you. In fact, there are a lot of people who would like to go to the dance with you, so keep asking until you find the one you would also like to go with.It is so much easier to say than do, but don't take rejection too personally.

You have every right to say “no” and go to the dance with someone you will be comfortable with for the night., If you do say no to an invitation, keep all of these issues you have been thinking about in mind. Consider how much stress and effort may have gone into this person asking you to the dance. Be kind when you refuse the invite.Tell them how much you appreciate them asking you and how good it makes you feel.
If you have a good reason, which you think might ease the blow, let them know the reason. Maybe you already have a date, or you are choosing just to go with friends. This may help the person understand it is not about them and give them the courage to ask someone else

There are four main body types for high school girls:Straight: This body type appears as a straight line, with very little definition between your bust, waist, and hips. Empire waist gowns fit straight body types well, as well as fitted sheaths. You may go for a one shoulder detail on your gown to add some drama.

Don't panic if he doesn't ask.,
Ask him yourself.",How to Get a Guy to Ask You to a Dance As a Preteen," If you want the boy you like to ask you to an upcoming dance, you have to make sure he knows who you are. If you’re not already friends, start doing some of the same things he does – maybe he’s in chess club or on the debate team or he plays an instrument. Joining one of the clubs or teams he belongs to will give you an opportunity to hang out with him. If you are already friends and spend time together at school, increase the amount of time you spend together by asking him if he wants to hang out after school.Don’t join a club or a team you don’t like just because he’s part of it. You could find something that you enjoy doing and ask him to join you.
Before you ask anyone to hang out after school, make sure you check that it’s okay with your parents first.;
, If you end up in the same club or on the same team, and even if you were already friends, he won’t know that you're interested in him if you don’t talk to him. Ask him about himself and tell him a little bit about yourself. If you’re really nervous about talking to him, you can start a conversation by talking about the activity you’re doing together.For example, you can say something like “Hey, so I’m new to chess club but you seem to be really good at it. How did you learn to play?” Or “I play violin but I always wanted to play guitar. I know that you've been playing for a while. Is it hard to learn?""
If you’re already friends and you’re trying to talk about something new, tell him something he doesn’t already know about you. For example, you could tell him about your favorite band or your favorite place to go on vacation.

, If you’re already friends with one of his friends, tell them that you're interested in him. They will probably tell him that they're friends with you - if he doesn't know already - and mention that you like him.


For example, you could say to one of his friends, “You're friends with Jimmy, right? I just joined the band that he's in and I've noticed he's really cool.”

, If you’re not comfortable talking to his friends about how you feel, ask one of your friends to talk to him for you. They don't have to come right out and say you want him to ask you to the dance, but they should find a way to tell him you’re interested.


If you’re asking one of your friends to talk to him directly, ask them to say something like “Sally has been telling me all about being in chess club with you. She thinks you’re really cool.”, Even if you’re spending time with the boy who you want to ask you to the dance, he might still not know that you’re interested in going to the dance at all. Bring it up in casual conversation while you’re talking about something else. This way, he knows that you know that the dance is happening and that you want to go.For example, if you’re talking about things happening at school, you could say something like “Oh, did you hear about the dance that’s happening in a couple of weeks? Do you know how much tickets are?” This way, he knows that you know that the dance is happening, but he also knows that you’re interested in going since you’re asking about the price of tickets.

, It might never have occurred to the boy who you want to go the dance with that he should go. If this is true, he’s not going to ask anyone to the dance, much less you. So ask him if he’s interested in going. You can have this conversation at the same time that you bring the dance up in conversation or you can ask him a few days later.For example, if you're already talking about the dance you could say something like “So you’ve heard about the dance? Have you decided if you’re going?” If it’s a few days after you brought up the dance for the first time you could say something like ""So have you thought any more about the dance? Have you decided if you're going?""

, Some boys might be embarrassed to ask you to go to the dance with them because they’re afraid that asking you makes it obvious that they want to go. If you tell him ahead of time that you’ve been imagining going to the dance with him, he’ll know that you want to go with him, and might feel more comfortable asking you out.


For example, you could say something like “So I know we kind of talked about the dance a few days ago, and since then I’ve really been thinking about how much fun it would be to go with you. Have you thought about who you want to go with?” This way he knows that you want him to ask you.

, Once you’ve brought up the dance and told him you want to go with him, give him a few days to think about. It might turn out that he does want to ask you but needs to gather his courage. Even if he knows you want to go with him, he might still be nervous about asking you.You shouldn’t completely stop talking to him once he knows that you want to go to the dance with him. Still do the things that you’ve been doing together, but don’t ask him every single day if he’s thought about who he wants to ask to the dance.

, There's a chance that the guy you like might not ask you to the dance. If he doesn't, it will probably hurt, but don't panic. There's no reason you can't ask someone else to go with you or just go with a group of your friends.

, If he’s really taking his time and the dance is only a few days away, you can always just ask him to go with you! This is an especially good idea if he’s really shy.


For example, you can say something like ""So we've talked about the dance and it's really getting close, so I was wondering if you maybe wanted to go with me.""

, For example, Converse or Vans.

, For guys, wear a neat top and well pressed slacks or trousers. Think of what you'd wear on smart occasions such as a wedding, a bar/bat mitzvah, your grandparent's 50th wedding anniversary, etc.

Lip gloss and a little eyeliner might be all you need.

, For casual events, it can be worn down and for more formal events, girls may wish to choose an updo, a bun or a braid. Avoid going over the top; at 13, the idea is to have fun, not spend hours in the hair stylist's seat.

Ask your school or friends about the style or theme of the dance so you understand it before you start to choose your clothing.;
, Notice if the dance has a theme for a holiday, season, or just for fun, and try to dress according to that theme. Wear a costume for a Halloween dance, or put on a Hawaiian shirt or grass skirt for a luau or island theme. Other dances may not require so much of a costume as a few general colors you might wear. For a “spring fling” type of dance, you could stick to light pastel colors, and for a Valentine’s Day dance you could wear some red or pink.


If the dance is a prom, you don’t necessarily need to dress to the theme, unless you want to. Wearing formal wear is typically more important than sticking closely to a theme, in this case.

, Adhere to your school’s general dress code or the specific code they provide for the dance. Look out for what the rules say about necklines, sleeves, hemlines, logos, and shoes, and make sure that what you plan to wear follows these guidelines.


Ask questions of your school administrators or teachers if you are unsure if a particular item of clothing is acceptable.

, Call up your friends or your date to the dance to ask what they’re wearing. Don’t feel like you need to wear the same thing as them, but they could help give you ideas for your own outfit. Get ready for the dance with friends, too, so that you can give each other tips as you’re putting on outfits and accessories.

Try playing up your eyes and mouth for a semi-formal dance.",How to Dress for a High School Dance (Girls)2," If you are attending a semi-formal dance, such as a spring social or a holiday dance, you should go for a semi-formal outfit. This could be a semi-formal dress that is long or short.The semi-formal dress should still be made of quality material, like silk, nylon, or chiffon, and follow your school’s dress code.

Avoid wearing tube style dresses, which are very tight and often made of spandex. These dresses may be against your school’s dress code for semi-formal dances.

, If you decide to wear a top and pants, go for pants made of non-denim material, such as rayon or silk. You may wear a top that is short sleeved, with a modest cut that is not skin tight. Your school likely will not allow you into a semi-formal dance if you are wearing a t-shirt and jeans.Keep in mind most schools will not allow you to cover up an inappropriate top with a jacket or a sweater. The organizers of the dance may not let you into the dance if you are inappropriately dressed.

, You should make sure you wear formal shoes, such as high heels or shoes with a low heel. Your school may allow you to wear flats, as long as they are made of quality material and appear semi-formal.Avoid wearing sneakers, runners, or flip flops, as these will likely not be allowed in a semi-formal dance.

Finish your look with lipstick or lip gloss in a bold color that plays off the color of your gown or outfit. If you decide to do a bold eye look, you may choose a more neutral shade for your lips so your makeup is polished but not overwhelming your face.

Create a casual outfit for an informal dance.,
Select casual shoes.,
Include accessories in your casual outfit.,
Keep your hair simple but well put together.,
Add fun details to your normal makeup routine.",How to Dress for a High School Dance (Girls)3," For informal dances, such as a gym dance, you should be able to wear a more casual outfit. Your school will likely allow most casual clothing, with a few exceptions.For casual dances, you should be able to wear a short dress or a top and a skirt. However, your dress should be no shorter than 3 inches above your knee. Your dress should not be skin tight or made of spandex and should have an appropriate neckline. If your midriff is exposed, you should be showing no more than two inches of skin.
You may also be able to wear jeans and a top, as long as the jeans do not have any holes in them or hug your hips very tightly. If you wear a top with jeans, the top should not expose your chest area inappropriately.

, You can wear casual shoes like sneakers, sandals, and flats to an informal dance. If you plan to dance, you may want to wear shoes that are comfortable with walk and dance in.You may want to skip the high heels for an informal dance, as you may appear overdressed for the event.

, For informal dances, you can add accessories like jewelry to your outfit. You may wear a fun pair of earrings, a necklace, and/or bracelets.You may also bring a small shoulder bag, as you likely will not be allowed into the dance with a large purse or a backpack.

, For an informal dance, you may want to stick to your normal hair routine, where you curl, straighten, and/or blow dry your hair. As long as your hair looks polished and put together, you may not have to add too much to your existing routine.


You can always add something extra to your look by putting your hair in a messy top bun or a side braid. Try to match your hair to your outfit by going for a more casual outfit with a particular hairstyle or keeping your hair casual if your outfit is a little more formal.

, You may want to keep your makeup minimal and simple for an informal dance. Follow your normal makeup routine and then add a fun detail like a bright lip gloss or lipstick or eyeliner in a fun color on your eyes. Adding one or two fun details to your normal makeup look can elevate your look so it looks polished but still casual and appropriate for an informal dance.

Choose a dress, skirt, or dress pants.,
Pick out heels or flats.,
Add a purse and jewelry.,
Apply tasteful makeup if you wish.,
Get hair and nails done.",How to Dress Appropriately for a School Dance2," If the school dance calls for formal wear, opt for a dress, formal skirt and top, or dress pants and nice blouse. Choose a full-length gown for an extra-formal look, or a knee-length dress or skirt for something more semi-formal.


If you’re going to the dance with a date, coordinate with them first to see if part of their outfit can match yours. If you go with a boy, their shirt, tie, or vest/cumberbund could match your dress, top, or accessories.

, Pick a pair of heels or flats that are comfortable enough for dancing and being on your feet for several hours. Try matching your shoes to your dress or accessories, or pick gold or silver shoes to match the type of metal of your jewelry.


Pay attention to dress code guidelines for shoes. There could be a restriction on the height of high heels.

, Choose accessories to complement your outfit. Pick a nice purse or clutch in the same color as your outfit or shoes, or in the same neutral silver or gold as your jewelry. Keep jewelry simple and classy by sticking to just a few pieces. If you wear big dangly earrings, stick to a simple necklace or bracelet. Or if you have an armful of bangles, choose a less flashy necklace and earrings.For a prom or other very formal dance, you can follow the tradition of wearing a corsage that complements your outfit and guy’s boutonniere. You can tell your date what color to buy you, or you can just buy or make your own! Wear the corsage either on your wrist or pinned to the front of your dress near the shoulder.Accessories are a great way to follow the color or theme of a dance. Pick a bright red purse or pair of shoes for a Valentine’s dance, stick a flower in your hair for a Spring dance, or buy a sparkly eye mask for a masquerade theme.

, If you want to, you can wear makeup to bring out the natural beauty of your face. Choose a concealer or foundation that matches your skin tone, and add a little blush or bronzer to your cheeks if you like. Sweep mascara onto your eyelashes and add eyeliner to your upper eyelids. If you go with bolder or darker eye makeup, stick to a light lip color or gloss, and vice versa., If you want to, get your hair styled at a salon in a traditionally formal updo. Or try curling, straightening, braiding, or another style that you or a friend can do to your hair. Add sparkly or colorful pins or clips for extra adornment. You can also go to a salon for a manicure and/or pedicure, paint your nails at home, or buy press-on nails.

Dress up a casual outfit.,
Pick appropriate shoes.,
Add complementing accessories.,
Apply light makeup if you want.",How to Dress Appropriately for a School Dance3," Try something just slightly dressier than your everyday clothes. Choose a nice pair of un-ripped dark-wash jeans with a shiny or sparkly top, a denim skirt with a nice blouse, or a light sundress. Just make sure your choices follow the school dress code.


It’s less common to coordinate colors with your date for a casual dance, but you still can if you like!
For a semi-formal dance, find something in between formal and casual wear. Opt for a skirt instead of pants if you’re comfortable wearing one. Or choose a casual dress in a light cotton or other knit rather than something shiny or sparkly.

, Remember that your shoes should be comfortable enough for dancing and being on your feet for several hours. Choose nice sandals, flats, or boots in a color that matches your top or accessories, or in a neutral brown, black, or gray.


Pay attention to dress code guidelines for shoes, which might say sneakers or flip-flops are off-limits.

, Pick a purse or clutch in the same color as your outfit or shoes, or in a neutral brown, black, or gray. Follow any dress code guidelines for jewelry, and keep it simple and classy by sticking to just a few pieces. If you wear big dangly earrings, stick to a simple necklace or bracelet. Or if you have an armful of bangles, choose a less flashy necklace and earrings., Wear makeup to bring out the natural beauty of your face if you like to, but it’s definitely not necessary for a casual dance. Stick with a concealer or foundation that matches your skin tone, and sweep some mascara onto your eyelashes. If you choose to wear dark eyeliner or colorful eyeshadow, stick to a light lip color or gloss. For more colorful lips, keep your eye makeup simpler."

Pick a suit or button-down shirt.,
Choose the right shoes.,
Add a belt and other adornments.",How to Dress Appropriately for a School Dance4," If the dance calls for formal attire, rent or buy a suit and wear a button-down shirt and tie underneath. You can opt for an optional vest or cumberbund under the suit, too. Or go without a jacket altogether and stick with nice dress pants and a button-down for more semi-formal dances.


If you’re going with a date, coordinate with them first to see if part of their outfit can match yours. If your date is a girl, their dress, top, or accessories could match your shirt, tie, or vest/cumberbund.

, Get dress shoes made of leather or similar material. Match them with the color of belt that you’re wearing.

, Wear a nice leather belt, and choose a watch and a piece of jewelry if you like, such as a ring or a simple necklace. Get cufflinks to fasten the sleeves of your button-down shirt.You can wear a top hat or other dressy hat if you want, but anything like a cap or beanie isn’t acceptable for a formal dance.


For a prom or other very formal dance, you can follow the tradition of wearing a boutonniere that complements your outfit and a girl’s corsage. You can tell your date what color to buy you, or you can just buy or make your own! Wear your boutonniere pinned to the lapel of your suit."

Dress up a casual outfit for an informal dance.,
Choose nice clean shoes.,
Accessorize appropriately.",How to Dress Appropriately for a School Dance5," Choose clothes that are slightly dressier than your everyday attire for a casual dance. Choose an un-ripped pair of dark-wash jeans with a button-down or nice sweater, for example. Pay attention to your school dress code if they prohibit certain logos or content on t-shirts or hats.


It’s less common to coordinate colors with your date for a casual dance, but you still can if you like!

, Pick a nice loafer, boat shoe, or possibly a nicer clean sneaker in a neutral color or in a color that complements your outfit. Avoid wearing athletic shoes that you wear to play sports, especially if they’re dirty from outdoor use. Pay attention to the dress code to see if it prohibits sneakers.

, Keep jewelry simple, like a nice watch, ring, necklace, or bracelet. Choose a leather belt if you wear a button-down or other shirt that needs to be tucked in. Avoid casual caps or beanies unless the dance is very casual, and check the dress code to make sure hats are okay if you do want to wear one.

Move your head to the music.,
Move your feet to the beat.,
Move your arms.,
Put your hips into it.,
See what everyone else is doing.,
Sing a few lyrics.,
Move around.,
Have fun dancing with your date.",How to Dance at Prom1," When you first get on the dance floor, you may be feeling a bit nervous, whether you're standing next to your date or just standing with a group of your friends. The first thing you should do after you hit the dance floor is to get a feel for the beat. Once you get it, move your head to the music, and start moving your body up and down slightly, so you're really feeling the beat.


Get your shoulders into it. Move them up and and down slightly along with your head.
Don't just bob your head up and down like some kind of robot. You can move slightly the left, and then the right, as you get a feel for the music.;
, If it's a faster song, you'll need to pick up the pace; if its slower but not a slow song, then move your feet slower. If you're an absolute beginner, then you don't have to put in too much effort in the footwork department. Just bend your knees and move up and down to the music. The important thing is that you keep your feet moving, not that you look like a professional.


Once you're comfortable with just moving your feet, you can do the ""two step."" In this dance move, all you have to do is step your right foot about a foot to the right, move your left foot over to the right, and gently tap the ground. Then, do the move again starting with moving your left foot to the left, and repeat.

, Now that your head, shoulders, and feet are really into it, you can start moving your arms too. Remember that, ideally, you should start moving all of your body parts at once. Starting with the head and feet will help you feel the rhythm, but you shouldn't keep your arms at your sides like dead fish. You can move your arms up and down to the music near your sides, down by your knees, or even up in the air, like you're dancing while washing a window.


Mix it up. Dance with your arms moving at your sides, and then have 'em move up in the air.
Don't underestimate the power of the ""raise the roof"" move at the right time.

, Your hips are a separate entity and they should not be ignored. Move them up and down along with the music, or move to the left and then the right, so your hips match the movements of your feet. Ladies, if you're feeling less shy, you can even gyrate your hips a bit to the music.

, Check out your friends on the dance floor. Pick a friend who is particularly confident and has great rhythm. See what move she's doing? Now steal it. That's right. Pick something simple to do with your arms and feet when you're getting bored with your simple moves, and see what happens. If your friend is doing it and looks good, then you can try to do the same.


You should also dance with the song in mind. If it's a funny song with a regular beat and people are clapping their hands, join in.

, This is a great thing to do when you feel like you don't know what you're doing. Look at your friends, mouth out the lyrics to the song, shake your head, and look like you're having such a great time with the song that you don't really care how you look.

, Don't just stand in one place or dance in the same two square feet of space. Move around by shuffling your feet and finding your friends. Keep it interesting and even make some light conversation with your friends or your date if you can do it without shouting too much. One thing you can do is stand in a circle with your friends and take turns moving in the center of the circle to show off your dance moves. Don't be nervous: when you dance in the middle of a circle, it'll normally be something silly.

, If your date is a wallflower and doesn't want to join you and your friends right away, wait a few songs before pulling your date onto the dance floor. But if you're dancing with your date to a fast song, just make sure you're following the same rhythm, standing at a comfortable distance, and having a great time. Some schools will have regulations about how close you can get, so make sure you know what your school requires of you. After that, just have fun.


During fast songs, you can still be in similar positions as you would in slow songs: a guy can put his hands on a girl's hips, and the girl can keep her arms around his neck.
If you want to grind with your date, make sure it's allowed by your school. This is a more sensual dance move than most.

Choose something to carry the disaster kit in.,
If you're bringing only a clutch then you probably won't be able to fit much more in there.,
Do not forget your ticket!,
Make sure you have the two most important things in your bag: a cell phone and extra cash.,
If you wear glasses, then bring contact lenses.,
Add lip gloss and breath mints, because you never know what might happen at the prom.,
Always have a small compact mirror and brush.,
Bring bobby pins and a travel size hairspray.,
Bring some extra makeup in your bag, such as lipstick, blush, etc., just in case you might need it during the prom.,
Pack a sewing kit and safety pins.,
Consider bringing double-sided tape and superglue.,
Bring Band-Aids.",How to Make a Prom Disaster Kit," Most girls at prom will have a small clutch - it doesn't hold much at all, but it does look great with a dress! Or instead bring a bigger bag and leave it somewhere safe at the prom venue, or in the car. You can fit more in there (like your make up and all everything else) even though it may not be something a lot of girls think of.;
, Consider keeping an extra bag with everything you need in the car. So if you need something then just sweetly ask your date to get it for you.

, You won't be able to get into prom without it. Identification (driver's license) would probably do you better if you bring it with you.

, You don't want to leave home without them. A cell phone is a good idea if you are in trouble or you need to call a taxi. Extra money is good if your date turns out to be a dud and you have to pay for your own meal or you have to pay for a taxi.

, If you're already wearing contact lenses to prom don't let it stop you from bringing an extra pair. That way if your contacts mess up, all you have do is get the extra pair out instead of walking around prom half blind.

, Blotting paper is wonderful if your working up a sweat on the dance floor and you want to keep your make-up from coming off or wipe off that sweat.

, Some brushes already have a mirror on them. You might not have to brush your hair, but a small compact mirror is a great way to make sure you still look great.

, Great if you need to keep your updo from falling and keeping it in place.

, Grab your bag and make a quick run to the bathroom with it.

, Keeping a needle and thread of your dress color is a way to make sure that if your dress strap breaks or if your dress rips, then you can fix it. If you don't know how to use a needle and thread then safety pins are a great way to keep your dress strap in place or to keep that rip from showing.

, Double-sided tape is a great way to keep your strapless from showing too much and to keep your dress strap from falling down. Superglue is a woman's best friend. What if you're out there on the dance floor and all of the sudden your heel breaks, are you just going to sit down for the rest of the night? Nope you're going to put some superglue on that sucker and get back to dancing. Or you could always bring an extra pair.


A safety pin or two are useful too.

, These can be handy for a variety of reasons, including: to stop bleeding if you cut yourself; to cover blisters from new shoes; or to hold something up that has come loose.

Pick a color or more than 1 color for your corsages.,
Buy 3 to 4 carnations per corsage you plan to make.,
Choose a filler flower or fern for your corsage.,
Buy a 1/2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) wired silk ribbon in the color of your choice.",How to Make a Carnation Corsage1," You may choose a neutral color like white, or a more specific color that matches clothing or decoration colors.;
, Spray carnations come with 3 to 5 blooms per stem, so you can use a few larger carnations or a handful of smaller carnations. Buy a few extra carnations, in case you lose a few in the process.

, Baby's breath, limonium, green ferns and green leaves can be used behind your carnations. They are available, along with the carnations, at most flower shops.

, This is available online or in craft stores.

Find out if she has a date for the prom already.,
Become friends with her if you aren't already.,
Flirt with her a little.,
Hang out with other girls.,
Try asking her in person.,
Look presentable.,
Smile at her when you make eye contact.,
Be yourself, breathe deeply, and relax.,
Ask her.,
Accept rejection in stride.",How to Invite a Girl to the Prom," If she does, it's just better to back off. You may not think so, but asking her when you know she has a date is pretty much self-sabotage: your chances of her agreeing (changing her mind) are next to none.


Look at her behavior. If you don't want anyone to know that you've been asking about her, it might be a good idea to just wait and watch. Girls are usually pretty vocal about their dates. You should be able to tell if she has a date.
Ask her friends, or get a friend to ask her friends. Asking her friends will probably tip your cards: the girl will eventually find out, but that could be a good thing. To avoid this, get one of your friends to ask one of her friends. Sneaky!
Ask her yourself. If you're super direct and don't think you'll worry about the consequences, ask her straight up. Just say: ""Just wondering, do you have a date to the prom?""
If she says ""no"" and seems a little shy about it, looking at you expectantly, go right ahead and ask her. If she says ""no"" but goes on talking about how she has to find one soon, looking a bit disinterested, maybe wait a little.


If you are already friends with her,ask her who she's going with, like you assume she already has one. This means you can often slide this into normal conversation without her necessarily suspecting that you are going to ask her.

If she's got someone to go with, she'll say who and you won't embarrass yourself
If she hasn't,she will say so and this means you can get onto Phase Two...


If she does realise you want to go with her, she'll probably be flattered that you assumed that she had a date as you must think of her as an attractive person to think that she already has one! ;)





, She's more likely to take someone to the prom if she knows them. Take every opportunity you can get without hounding or smothering her: science projects, sitting next to one another at lunch, inviting her to a party you're going to, etc. Look at every social opportunity as a way to better get to know her.


Try to be casual when you talk to her. It's really hard to do when you like someone, granted, but remind yourself that the stakes aren't high at the end of the day. If you ask her and she says ""no,"" it's not the end of the world. You'll end up asking and taking another girl, who could end up being more special at the end of the day.
When you talk to her, try asking questions about her. People like having the chance to talk about themselves, their interests, and their aspirations. Focus on her in the beginning and the conversation will naturally shift to you after some time.

, You'll help your chances with her if she begins to see you as a romantic interest. You can start becoming a romantic interest by starting to flirt, slowly but surely. Everyone flirts differently, but there are a couple of flirting basics that every guy should know.


Compliment her from time to time. Compliment aspects of her personality, and occasionally, her looks. When complimenting her looks, stay away from the really feminine areas and stick to:
Eyes. ""Your eyes match the color of your shirt. Were you going for that?""

Smile. ""Your smile absolutely lights up the room. Every time!""

Style. ""I really like your style. I think a lot of other girls secretly envy it, too.""

Hair. ""Your hair looks good when you put it up. I like what you did with it.""



Slowly break the touch barrier. Get used to making contact with her slowly and at her pace. Girls don't like guys who are constantly touching them every time they talk, so it's a tricky balancing act for you. Focus on:
Touching her hand, arm, shoulder, and back while making points in conversation. If you don't know her at all, wait a bit until you start breaking the barrier.
Not going for threatening or sensitive areas, such as the thighs, stomach, and neck. There are strictly off-limits until you're dating.
Playfully touching her after you've grown closer. You can try tickling her, for example, if you're giving her a hard time. Be sure she's in a playful mood before you do this.



, Girls like guys who can impress other girls. For one, it tells them that you're trusted by other girls. Second, it lets them know that other girls think you're interesting. Hanging out with other girls will subconsciously let your potential date know that you are eligible material. And that's a good thing.

, Asking her in person will establish a real, physical connection between the two of you, and will give you a better shot of getting a ""yes"" from her. That's because, for better or for worse, it's a lot harder to reject someone in person. If you can summon up the courage to ask her in person, you'll increase your chances of getting the answer you'd hoped for.


If you can't ask her in person, think about writing a letter and slipping it to her. Make it romantic without being gushy. You want to let her know that you like her, but you don't want her to think that you're creepy and have been obsessing over her for months. Give it to her in person, or slip it in her locker.
As a last resort, ask her over IM or text. Neither option is really ideal, but sometimes life throws you a curveball. Try asking her point blank if she has a prom date. If she doesn't, go in and ask her. Beware, however: your chances of success over IM or text are a lot lower than asking in person or even a letter.

, She may not want to go to prom with you if you have bad breath, unkempt hair and/or oily skin. Don't change yourself too much to please her, but remember to be hygienic:


Brush your teeth every morning, before school, but especially before you ask her out. You want fresh breath when you talk to her.
Shower if you're dirty. If you have rowing or soccer practice before school, for goodness sake, don't skip out on the morning shower. Cleanliness is next to godliness, remember?
Don't lay it on thick with the cologne. Contrary to popular belief, spraying yourself with massive amounts of cologne is not a winning proposition in her eyes. One spray at most, or better yet — let your natural cleanliness shine.
Dress to impress. You don't have to wear a suit and tie when you ask her, but you do want to put your best foot forward. Look really nice without looking like you walked straight out of the '50s.

, You smile when you're happy; but did you know that smiling can also cause you to be happy? Researchers have found that smiling can actually improve your mood organically, and make painful moments less painful.A happier you usually means a happier her. And if that doesn't make your chances better, what will?

, If you're normally a funny guy, don't play it super serious all of a sudden. If you're normally a serious guy, don't try to be a regular jokester. Nerves will probably keep you from asking her the exact way you had planned on asking her, but it's usually not as bad as we think it is.


Put the situation in terms of risk and reward. You want low risk and high reward, and that's exactly what you're getting. (You should be a betting man.) The risk is that she'll say ""no."" You'll be embarrassed for an hour, and then you'll move on. The reward is that she'll say ""yes,"" and you don't need to read on to go down the list of why that's good!

, This is the moment you've been waiting for. Depending on your personality, you ask her in a variety of ways. Here are some ideas for you to build on:


Be inventive. Especially for girls who you're closer to, or perhaps expect you to ask them, try:
Lighting up candles on her driveway that spell ""Prom?"" Be there when she steps outside.
Write ""Prom"" on a piece of paper, laminate it, and then break it up into a puzzle. (Alternately, you can buy pre-broken puzzle pieces to write on.) Give it to her to assemble.
Make your own soda label asking her out to prom. Then tape the label onto a bottle of soda and give it to her.


Be direct. These are more emotionally-driven ways to ask a girl out to prom. They're the oldest trick in the book, and that's because they work really well:
""I know we're just friends right now, but there isn't anyone else that I'd rather take to prom. Will you go with me?""
""I've been meaning to ask you this for a while now, but I get so tied up around pretty girls. Will you go to prom with me?""
""I've been waiting for this day for a while now. And unless I just go out and say it, I'll probably not say it directly enough: will you go to prom with me?""



, We all deal with rejection. If you've never been rejected, you're not trying enough. If your hopeful date turns out to be not so hopeful herself, don't get angry, sullen, or try to debate her. She probably has good reasons for choosing her answer, and if she doesn't, you probably didn't want to go to prom with her in the first place.


Try to put a smile on your face, look her in the eyes, and say something like: ""That's totally fine, I understand. I hope we can still stay friends."" You never know what plain old decency could get you.

Find your way around.,
Find the Intan.,
Once you locate the Intan, click it and wait.,
If you’re wearing an AO (Animation Overrider), turn this off or it can interfere with the dance animations.

,
The other way to dance is to teleport to an animation store and buy a dance hud that hold your own dances.,
Come prepared to spend.,
Load a dance hud.,
Now that you have your new hud, find a club and a spot on the dance floor.,
Some people in Second Life call this sharing of a dance hud a “chin.” If you get asked to share someone’s chin, remember they are asking to animate your avatar.,
Don’t forget to release everyone on your hud before you leave, otherwise they will continue dancing!,
Learn how to dance with someone else.,
If you’re a man, and asking a woman to dance for the first time, please select dances that are appropriate for strangers and not groping dances.",How to Dance in Second Life," One of the challenges of Second Life is learning to get around, and dancing is no different. Often you'll find yourself at a club, but don’t know how to animate your avatar. There are several ways to show your style and this will explain how you can dance alone, with a group or as a couple.;
, Every club has what’s called an Intan. An Intan is an object that contains dance animations that will activate your avatar. They’re usually hanging above the dance floor and are often shaped like a ball or heart. They often rotate, and might be a rainbow of colors. They can also be alongside the dance floor on a poll. If you’re alone, you will look for a single ball, either pink for girls or blue for boys. If you’re a couple, you might look for two balls (or hearts) joined together. Please feel free to ask a hostess if you can’t find the Intan, or you can ask in local chat, “Where is the Intan, please?”

, Soon a pink or blue (depending on what you selected) ball, or heart, will appear. If the lag is bad, it could take longer. Right click object and sit, or dance, depending on the menu. Next a drop down menu will appear and ask if you can be animated. You will say, yes, and your avatar will begin to dance. Next you will get another drop down menu that will offer different dances. Every club is different, but after time you will recognize some of the names. This will help you to dance along with the music.

,, Many do this because they like their own style. Some dance hubs will include a few dances. Most do not hold dances, but require you to have your own. You can activate individual dances from your inventory without a hud, but it’s not optimal. To do this, double click the dance and a menu will appear on your screen with instructions. It’s highly recommended you use a hud. Your dances will be organized, easy to find and you can keep the hud attached to your desktop for quick access.

, Dances are very expensive. Don’t be surprised at the cost. Animations are the most expensive item in Second Life besides land. They run from 200-350 Lindens per dance. You should try dances out before purchase. Animation shops have test dances. You can also buy dance packs on Second Life Marketplace. However you get your dances, you need to put them into the hud.

, To load a dance hud, or any animation hud in second life, you take the hud out of inventory and place it on the ground in a location that allows you to build, usually at home or a public sandbox. Huds are often very small, so watch where you place it. Once you have the hud on the ground, you right click and open it. Now you see what’s inside. Go to your inventory and locate your dances. You can search by name or if you recently bought them and did not log out, you can find them in your recent folder. If you bought them on Marketplace, they are in your Marketplace folder. Right click each dance and drag it to the open hud. Some huds will ask you what kind of an animation this is, and you would pick dance from a menu of, sit, stand, walk, etc. If the hud recognizes the animation, it will not ask you anything. Pick the hud up when you’re done loading, locate it again in your inventory (look in recent), and wear the hud. It will reside on your desktop, meaning you will see a box of some kind with menu buttons. You can move the hud by hovering your mouse over the hud, right clicking to edit, then grabbing the arrows and moving the it around the desk top. Or, you can detach it from the desk top and attach it to a new location on the desktop. Rest assured the hud designers select the best location.

, You can select the dance you want from your hud menu. Another feature is you can offer other people a chance to dance in sync alongside you. This is not the same as couple dancing, but more like line dancing. This is great fun! Your hud will have a menu for sharing dances. Generally you can ask as many people as you want to dance on your hud. You should ask them in private chat if they want to share a dance. It’s rude to just send a request without asking.

, The same is true if you’re the one with the chin; you will be animating someone’s avatar. It’s not nice, for example, to offer a chin and then pick a belly dance if that person’s a man. There is some responsibly when sharing dance animations. Be considerate, and remove them at once if they ask. Try to use dances that match the music. Learn your dances so you can change dances effortlessly.

, If this happens to you, stopping animations on your avatar depends on your viewer. Most have this option on the top of the screen in one of the drop down menus. It might be called “Avatar Health.”

, Couple dancing is different. You will not be using your hud. If you’re asked to dance by someone else, follow them out to the dance floor, let them retrieve the dance balls. Once you are on your ball/heart (pink or blue), you will get a menu asking if you can animate your avatar, and say, yes. Then allow them to pick the dance because they asked you. But, if you're not comfortable with their selection, tell them to change the dance. If you're not in sync together, Second Life will sync you automatically in a few minutes, or you can ask your dance partner to sync you. Sometimes you will be out of sync, but your partner might see you from his computer as in sync. Ask your partner to sync you. He will know what this means.

, And pay attention to the music. Don’t have your partner on the same dance for each song! Please tell your partner you’re going to stand when you’re ready to disengage.

Position your arms correctly.,
Position your feet correctly.,
Start moving.,
Don't worry about assuming traditional roles.,
Chat a little bit.",How to Dance at Prom2," If you want to start off on the right foot, then you and your date have to put your arms in the right place first. For the prom slow dance, the arm movements are much simpler than for the traditional slow dance. The guy just has to put his arms on either side of the girl's waist, and the girl has to wrap her arms around the guy's waist.


Depending on how intimate you want the dance move to be, you should dance about one foot to half a foot (30 - 15 cm) away from your partner.
Girls should plan their shoe height in advance. They should wear shoes that wouldn't make them taller than or at eye-level with their date, or they may feel a little awkward during the slow dance.

, Face your partner with at least one to two feet between your heads. Don't stand with your toes touching or you'll bump into each other; instead, stand either with your feet alternating or with the girl's feet inside of the guy's. Keep your feet at last 1 to 1.5 feet (0.3 to 0.5 m) apart (30 cm-45 cm) so you can move from side to side without any problems.

, Slow dancing is about as easy as it gets. Just keep your arms positioned correctly, maintain a respectable distance from your partner, and sway back and forth, transferring your weight from one foot to the other without lifting your feet. If you want to rotate or move a bit, just move your feet in rhythm with your partner's.


If you're comfortable with this simple dance, you can go for the ""step touch,"" which means to just step to the right with your right foot, and then to follow this foot with your left, tap the ground, and then reverse the motion by stepping to the left with your left foot, letting the right foot follow it, and so on. Just make sure you keep your feet in sync with your partner's.

, In ""real"" slow dancing, the guy takes the lead while the girl follows. In this version, the guy holds one of the girl's hands and leads her into the direction he wants to go; the girl has to follow so they stay on course. But when you're talking about the good old prom slow dance, that's really not necessary. You'll just be moving from side to side.


If the guy wants to lead, just follow his cue and move in the direction he moves; but for the most part, you won't be moving around too much.
Just remember to dance to the beat of the music. Not all slow dance songs have the exact same rhythm, so you will have to move a bit faster or slower depending on the beat.

, If you and your partner are totally in love, then sure, you can just sway there and look longingly into each other's eyes. But for most of you, slow dancing in silence could get a little boring or awkward, so don't be afraid to talk to your partner, crack a joke, or just make small talk a little bit. You can say you love or hate the song that's playing, compliment your partner on his or her looks or dancing skills, or talk about the couples around you. Do whatever you gotta do to have fun and feel comfortable.

Milk the cow.,
Do the running man.,
Beat back the beat.,
Wax the car.,
Comb your hair.,
Reel in your friend.,
Do the Harlem Shake.,
Get ready to bust out your synchronized dance moves.",How to Dance at Prom3," This is completely silly and an instant classic. Just bend your knees, bob up and down, while raising your fists in the air, one at a time, alternating as if you were milking an actual cow. Keep this up for thirty seconds or so with a serious and committed look on your face, and everyone around you will be laughing and joining in.

, This is another great move that will get you some laughs for at least a minute or two, or until it gets old. The running man is simple. Just lift one foot high in the air so your thigh is parallel to the floor, and then set it back and down while simultaneously lifting the other foot. Keep alternating lifting and putting down your feet while either swinging your arms in an exaggerated manner at your side, like you're prancing, or pushing your arms back and forth, like you're skiing or elbowing someone.


This works best paired with a Carlton Banks-esque grin on your face.

, Get inspired by the Jersey Shore cast and bounce up and down while pumping your fists at the ceiling, alternating with one fist up and one fist down. Just pick a song and stick to the beat. Don't be embarrassed if the occasional, ""Yeah, baby!"" escapes your lips.

, Bounce your knees and from side to side and alternate between using your right and left hands to wipe wax on your car in a circle, moving one hand in a circular motion for about three seconds before swaying to the other side and using the other hand to repeat the same motion. This move works great if you synchronize with a few friends.

, First, get a look on your face that says you're all that and you know it. Then, turn to your left side and fake run your right hand over your hair like you're combing it, making your perfect 'do look even more perfect. Bounce your feet up and down as you do this, and rinse and repeat on the other side. Keep it up until your hands look tired, or until you know you can't look any better.

, You can pull this move at least 2-3 times at your prom before people start rolling your eyes. Just be the fisherman: cast your line far and away, aiming toward your friend, the fish. Keep bouncing as you do this, so you're not just standing in place. Then, lean back and start reeling in your friend like he or she is a heavy, heavy fish. Your friend should puff up his or her cheeks and move his or her hands toward and away from his or her mouth, acting like a fish that has gotten caught on your line.

, When that song comes on, wait for the leader to dance around and take control. When you get your cue, do anything you want, as long as it's with enthusiasm: lean back, start swinging your arms wildly behind you with bent knees, punch the air, shake your head from side to side, and generally look like you're having a seizure. Don't worry: this dance tends to only last a little more than a minute, so you'll be done before you start seeing bright white spots in front of your eyes.

, Every prom will play a few songs that have designated dance patterns. These are a fun break from figuring out what the heck to do with yourself, and normally all you have to do is master a handful of dance moves and generally do what everyone else is doing. If you don't want to have to sit out like a wallflower when any of these songs come on, then become a pro at the following dances in advance:


""The Cupid Shuffle""
""Teach Me How to Dougie""
Soulja Boy's ""Crank That""
""The Macarena""
""The Electric Slide""

",How to Make a Carnation Corsage2," Leave a little of the stem on each carnation to preserve the base of the flower and to thread with wire.

, They should be slightly longer than your carnations and approximately the size you want your corsage to be.

, You will need as many wires as you have carnation blooms.

, Push it halfway through and then bend each end so that it goes straight down next to the remaining stem. Make sure it is bent so that there is a small amount of horizontal wire that goes through the stem, instead of being simply bent in half.

, This self-adhesive tape is available at most craft stores.

Enjoy your prom!",How to Get Ready for Prom in Advance," Finding your prom dress is one of the most fun parts of prom planning, but it can also be the most stressful. There are endless options to choose from, so it's best to start looking for your dress a few months in advance so you have plenty of time to find the perfect one for you. Check out some magazines for inspiration and shop for a dress that works with your signature style, whether it's classic preppy, romantic vintage, or modern and edgy. The important thing is to find a dress that makes you feel great.Check out online prom sites for tons of options at discount prices. Make sure you order well in advance so you can get your dress altered if necessary.
If you like the vintage look, shop in consignment and vintage stores. You can find incredible deals there.
If you want a designer dress without the big price tag, check out Rent the Runway or another designer dress company that lets you rent a dress for a fraction of the retail price.
See if your date wants to wear an outfit that matches yours (i.e. your dress matches his vest/tie).;
, Don't draw negative attention to an otherwise stunning dress by having your bra straps or underwear lines showing! Head to the intimates department to pick out underwear that will help you look your best.


Choose a bra that gives you full support without showing. If your dress is backless or strapless, there are plenty of options that will still work for your dress.
Choose seamless underwear in a color that won't show through.
If your dress is sheer, you may need a slip to go underneath.

, Once you've got the dress nailed down, it's time to add the details that will make your outfit look complete. Pick accessories that accent the style of your dress without being overpowering.Vintage and costume jewelry stores offer amazingly intricate jewelry at a very low price.
If you can't find just the right jewelry and you're feeling ambitious, why not make your own?
Don't forget to pick out a bag or clutch that matches your dress! It should be big enough to hold essentials like makeup, your cell phone and keys.
If your prom is in early spring, it might still be chilly outside. Choose a coverup or shrug to put over your shoulders in case you get cold.

, Your shoes should match your dress, but don't worry if you can't find heels in the exact same color. You can buy white shoes and have them dyed, or go with a neutral; nude or black heels look amazing with almost any dress color. Bring your dress to the shoe store so you can try them on together to make sure they work.


Break in your heels before the big day. Wear them around the house and outside on the concrete to scuff the soles up a bit. This will make your shoes more comfortable and less likely to slip when you're walking around on the night of prom.
Consider bringing backup flats. If you aren't used to wearing tall heels, your feet might start to hurt. Have a backup pair of neutral ballet flats you can slip on just in case.

, Many girls opt to have their hair done in a salon on the morning of prom, but it's also a popular choice to do your own prom hair. There are hundreds of great tutorials online offering advice on how to create beautifully styes for any hair type. Here are a few styles that are gorgeous for prom:


Romantic, loose waves
Braided updo
Classic chignon

, Check out beauty videos to find ideas for how to do your makeup in a way that matches the rest of your style. Some girls use prom as a good excuse to go out all with sparkles and color, while others like a toned-down, classic look. Play around with different ideas until you settle on a look that makes you feel awesome and looks good with your dress.



Smoky eyes are sexy and classic.

A bold red lip will turn heads.
You may want to consider contouring your face.

Decide on your nail color, too.

, If you're planning on getting your hair, makeup or nails done at a salon, book your appointment at least a month in advance. That way you won't be scrambling to find openings at the last minute. Salons tend to fill up during prom season.


Your nail appointment should be made for the day or two before prom day.
Your hair and makeup appointments should be made for the morning of prom.

, Some people like to go with a date, and others prefer to go single. Either way, it's fun to go with a big group of people you have dinner with before prom and party with after. A good group number is six to ten people; more than that, and you'll have trouble making dinner reservations (although if extras join later, it probably won't be an issue to squeeze them in). Once your group is set, you can all start planning together.


Make a Facebook group that includes everyone who is part of your prom group. You can talk about where you're going to meet, where to have dinner, etc.
Decide how your group is going to handle prom photos, too. Who will be in the pictures? Do you want to take them at someone's house, or will you have them professionally done at prom? Discuss with the group.

, Prom tickets usually go on sale a month or two before the date. You might as well get your ticket sooner rather than later so it'll be one less thing to worry about. If you're bringing a date, make sure you get a ticket for your date, too.

, Will you be taking a limo to prom, driving your own cars, or getting dropped off? Figure out what you want to do several weeks ahead of time so you won't have to worry about it as the day approaches. Talk with your date and your friends to decide the best course of action.


If you want to rent a limo, figure out how much each person in the group will owe (including tip). Make reservations with limo company, and make sure everyone knows where and when to meet the limo before the night begins.

, It's customary to go out to a nice dinner before prom with your group of friends. You can spring for the nicest restaurant in town or go for something a little more low key so you won't have to worry about a big bill. Just make sure you call the restaurant several weeks ahead of time to make your reservation.


If more people decide to join your group later, call back to update your reservation.
You don't have to go out to dinner. Some groups like to pre-party at someone's house instead.

, Prom after parties are almost as fun as prom itself. Depending on the size of your group and your budget, you have a lot of options here. Talk with your group to decide where you're all going to go when people are tired of dancing and ready for the real party to start.


You can pool your money and rent out a hotel room near the place where your prom is being held.
If a hotel is too pricey, it's also popular to have a co-ed sleepover with all your friends.
If you want something a bit more low-key, you could just plan to have a few of your closest friends spend the night so you can discuss everything that happened at prom.

, It's a good idea to let them know what you have in mind a few weeks in advance. Your parents are going to be almost as excited about your prom as you, and filling them in on the details will help things run more smoothly. Plus, if you want a later curfew or permission to go to a coed sleepover, you might need time to help them see your point of view.


If your parents aren't happy about your plans, a good strategy is to try to include them a little more. Ask them to take pictures beforehand, or ask their opinion on what restaurant to choose. The more involved they are, the more likely they'll be to help you have a fantastic night your way.
If your parents haven't met your date or the people you'll be spending the night with introduce them in advance so they'll feel like they're in the loop.

, If you're bringing a guy to prom, it's customary to give him a boutonniere to pin to his tux. For a girl, order a corsage to wear around her wrist. Call a flower shop and choose the flowers you want included. Order it to be picked up on the morning of prom, so the flowers will be as fresh as possible.

, Now's the time to make exchanges, get your dress altered, or change your mind about what shoes to wear. Don't wait until the week of prom to make big changes in your wardrobe. You'll have enough to worry about that week!, It sounds like a pain, but it is worth it to confirm them. A week or so ahead of prom, call all the places you made appointments or reservations to double check they still have you booked for the right day and time.

, Rather than scrambling to fill up your purse right before prom, it's better to have everything you need ready to go a few days in advance. Pack your bag with essentials you'll need at dinner and afterward. If you're spending the night out, you may need to pack a second bag with necessities you'll need for spending the night.


To pack in your purse: your invitation, lipstick, small perfume bottle, small bottle of moisturizer, travel size hairspray, extra bobby pins, cell phone charger, keys, and a wallet.To pack in your overnight bag: nightclothes, toiletries, hanger and dress bag for your prom dress, change of clothes for the next morning.

, You want to look and feel your best on prom day, so it's important to be healthy the day before. To avoid feeling bloated, sick or tired, do the following:


Drink tons of water to stay hydrated.
Eat fruits and veggies.
Get a full night's sleep.
Do at least half an hour of exercise.
Go to your nail appointment or give yourself a manicure.

, You want to give yourself plenty of time to exfoliate, shave, and moisturize. Wake up several hours before your first appointment so you won't end up having to rush.


Exfoliate your skin until it's soft and gleaming using either a body scrub or a loofah. Don't forget your shoulders, back and arms.
Shave your legs, bikini area, armpits and so on.
Moisturize your skin with a rich moisturizer so it's soft all day.
Use a pumice stone on your feet to make them smooth.

Give yourself a quick facial to brighten your face.
You might want to put an extra top coat on your nails to keep them from getting chipped.

, If you're getting your hair done and makeup done, go to your appointments before putting on your prom dress and accessories. Wear comfortable clothes that are easy to pull over your head without messing up your hair. Remember to bring pictures of the looks you want so your stylists won't have trouble making you look just right. If you ordered a boutonniere or corsage, don't forget to pick it up.

, Some people like to get ready with their friends, while others prefer to do it on their own at home. Either way, it's finally time to wear that dress that's been hanging in your closet! Put everything on and give yourself a once over in the mirror before you head out.


Ask a friend to check you from the back to make sure there are no loose threads or strands of hair that need to be fixed.
Double check your bag to make sure you have everything you need for the night.
Make sure your cell phone is fully charged.

, All your hard work is now falling into place, so relax and enjoy the night. Even if you experience a hitch in your plans, try to go with the flow. So what if the limo is late, your hair comes a little loose or the corsage your date gives you doesn't match your dress? What matters now is having the time of your life, so let loose and enjoy it.

Flip through fashion magazines and comb the internet for styles that really stand out to you. After you’ve scrapbooked for a while, you’ll notice that a clear picture of what you really want your dress or tux to look like is beginning to form in your mind.


Try to narrow things down as specifically as possible, even down to particular color choices.
Bring your scrapbook with you when you go shopping. It will help you stay focused on the look you’re going for and make shopping a little easier.;
, Give yourself plenty of time to search for the right dress. This is not a choice that you want to rush! Start looking about 3 or 4 months in advance. Hit all of the stores in your area and if possible, have a parent take you shopping out of town, as well.


Remember, all of the other girls are shopping just like you are. They are most likely going to the same shops and looking at the same gowns.
Shopping out of town will help you feel secure that whatever dress you choose, someone else won’t be wearing it.
Don’t forget to hunt for a dress online. It’s not an ideal situation, since you won’t be able to try it on before you buy it. However, if you find something that you really love online and it’s still relatively early in the game, you can have it tailored to fit you perfectly once it arrives.

, While tuxedos aren't quite as variable as dresses, there are still a lot of details you'll want to get just right. Start hunting for your tux about 3 or 4 months in advance.


Prom is a black-tie affair, so you really want to go with either a tuxedo or a very dark and dapper suit.Try to narrow down which one you want before you go out shopping, so that you can stay focused. At the very least, nail it down super early in your hunt.
Most choose to go with a tux, but there's no reason why you can't do your own thing!
You want to ensure that you are able to find your ideal tux in plenty of time to also have it tailored before prom. Tuxedos and suits, right off the rack, are generally cut to fit male model prototypes. Gender presentation, personal style or sexual orientation aren't usually addressed right off the rack., Bring someone that you know will be completely honest with you. Whenever you find a dress or tux that you are definitely considering, don’t just try it on alone in the dressing room. Come out and get their honest opinion.


When you try on a gown or tux that you really like, ask your shopping companion to snap a picture of you wearing it with your phone. That way you’ll have a mini-archive of everything that you really liked to reference later, when you're ready to start narrowing it down.
Don’t make a snap decision. Try on lots of dresses or other ensembles and collect at least 10 to 15 pictures of possible choices for your mini-archive before even considering making your final decision.

, Avoid shopping for fads and choose a dress style and fit that suits your particular figure and coloring.Not only will you look better, but you will ultimately feel more confident wearing a dress that you know suits you as an individual.


Fads are great, but some gowns and styles are timeless and will always be beautiful.
When you look back at your prom pictures years later, you want to feel proud of the way you look, not slightly embarrassed because you’re wearing a fad that passed quickly and didn’t look good on you.

, If you find the absolute perfect dress but it’s too small when you try it on, do not buy the dress with the intention of going on an intense crash diet. That is far too much pressure to put on yourself! And worse - if you fail, what will you wear instead? You’ll have to rush to find a back-up at the last minute, which you definitely want to avoid.


You look great the way you are right now and there are plenty of beautiful dresses out there that will fit you just right. Don’t change yourself for a dress.
Find a tailor for your dress if you are genderqueer or in transition. This is because dresses, right off the rack, are made to fit a female model's silhouette. A tailor can make a few tweaks for you that will take your look to the next level.
Do not allow gender or sexual orientation to stop you from getting exactly want you want, whether that's a dress or a tux. You deserve the absolute best and there are tailors out there that specialize in custom fits.If you find a dress that you love but it’s too big when you try it on, talk to a store associate about the possibility of tailoring it. Some gowns are made of materials that aren’t suitable for tailoring, and others are just too fragile or stylized to be changed, so get a good, clear opinion from an expert.

, When it comes to choosing jewelry and shoes, base your selections around your dress. Not just the color of the dress – you want to go beyond that. Look for options that suit the style of your dress. A particular necklace may look gorgeous in the case, but clash with your dress.


For instance, if you decide on a vintage-looking gown, you don’t want to wear modern jewelry with it. You’ll want to pick things that have a vintage flair, to coordinate with the dress style.
Focus on achieving an overall look, rather than finding individual pieces that you like that may or may not end up looking good together.

, Traditionally, prom couples coordinate their ensembles by choosing matching and complimentary accessories to tie their look together as a unit. Find out the color of your date's dress in plenty of time to find your accessories.


Choose a long tie, bow tie, and/or cummerbund that match your date's dress as closely as possible. You can also have your date provide her dress to a tailor, who can then dye your accessories to match hers almost exactly.
If you aren't able to match your date's dress, go with neutral choices that match your tux or suit.
Long tie or bow tie? The bow tie is the traditional choice, especially with a tuxedo.If you go with a suit, opt for a long tie instead.

, Don’t accessorize with something that doesn’t immediately make you feel pretty or handsome when you put it on. Accessories are meant to accent and highlight your ensemble and you. Select them with care and be very choosy.

, If you're hitting your prom solo or just don't want to match your date, consider coordinating with your prom theme. This will visually tie your look and ensemble in with the whole night, rather than a particular person.


If you are going with a group, consider coordinating your looks as a unit.

, Yes, your shoes should be totally awesome, but they also need to be relatively comfortable to wear. Prom isn’t just standing around – you’ll be dancing, getting in and out of cars, and navigating obstacles. If you choose your shoes based on looks alone, you may end up being miserable on prom night because you can’t dance in them, or because they are squeezing your feet too tightly.


Try them on before you buy them and walk around the store until you get a sense of how they’ll perform on prom night.
Be honest with yourself! If you love them but it’s obvious that the heels are too high for you, keep looking. You’ll find the right pair eventually.
On prom night, when you’re cutting a rug on the dancefloor and having a blast, you’ll be glad you took the extra time to find the right shoes.

, Don’t be afraid to try something that you normally wouldn’t wear. It’s prom, so live the fantasy a little! For instance, maybe you find a breathtaking tiara that perfectly mirrors your dress and hairstyle. Or maybe it's an unusual set of cufflinks to go with your tux or suit. Ordinarily you’d never wear a tiara or those particular cufflinks, but it's prom night! If it looks good on you, then rock it.


Make sure to get a few opinions before you commit to anything unusual. You want to stand out, but not for the wrong reasons.

, Start scrapbooking a few months in advance, just like you did for your dress. In fact, you can start matching makeup looks to dress styles as early as the scrapbooking stage!


By the time you get to the hair and makeup part of your prom deliberations, you’ll already have your dress and accessories picked out, as well as a book full of images to review. You can’t go wrong when you prepare that well!

, Start experimenting with the looks you find very early to get a clear picture of what does and doesn’t work for you. Don’t be afraid to try a daring hair or makeup style! It might be absolutely perfect for your dress and suit you wonderfully. On the other hand, it may make you feel uncomfortable or anxious on prom night, and that’s no fun.


Experiment as much as you want, but when it comes down to it, make a solid choice that works for you.
Don’t completely reinvent yourself for prom night – you want to look like yourself in your pictures and be recognizable to your date and friends!
Essentially, you want to look like the best version of your everyday self, with a little extra pizzazz thrown in.

, After you’ve experimented with a few looks and you nail it down, practice recreating your hair and makeup look multiple times before the big night. You don’t want to spend 3 hours on the afternoon of prom trying to perfect winged eyeliner or some other detail that you aren't used to creating - that will definitely stress you out.


If you practice ahead of time you can perfect the look and when prom comes, you can recreate it without a hitch.
After applying your makeup, always set it with a translucent powder as your final step. This will help your makeup last through the night and also control any oil and shine, which will keep you looking fresh and matte for photographs.

, That could be anything from a dashing side part, slicked back completely, or even a messy, tousled 'do, depending on what kind of look you are going for.


Get short hair cut or trimmed a day or two before prom, not the day of. If you want a straight razor shave, visit a barbershop on the morning of prom.
If you want to look really unique or do something very different from everyone else, consider dying your hair. You could even consider dying streaks into your hair that coordinate with your date's ensemble!
Don't be afraid to stand out or embrace a look that truly represents you.

, If you aren’t that savvy with makeup or hairstyles, consult your hairstylist. Most stylists studied makeup along with hair when they were training at cosmetology school, so they are invaluable sources of information and can help you create the perfect look.


Express to your stylist that you want your hair to look great, but you also want a fairly uncomplicated ‘do that you can maintain easily on your own throughout the evening.
Don't get talked into something that you don't like by an over-zealous stylist.

, You want to look fit and feel good in your dress, and the number one way to achieve that is to exercise regularly. If you don’t like cardio or if hitting the gym sounds like torture, try yoga instead.


You can take yoga classes at your local gym or, if your prefer, you can watch instructional videos and practice yoga at home. Sometimes it's easier to embark on a new fitness routine starting at home, so that you can get used to it before doing it in front of other people.
No matter what exercise regimen you choose, the result will be a happier, healthier you.

, No crash diets! Eat sensibly and get enough vitamins and nutrients to keep you healthy and glowing. Drinking lots of water will keep you looking dewy and fresh and help you keep your complexion clear.


Don't starve yourself before prom. You don’t want to look malnourished and waif-thin on prom night. Malnourished isn't a good look for anyone.
Eating healthy and well will ensure that you have plenty of strength and energy for your big night.
Along with drinking plenty of water, make sure to use a good moisturizer on your skin every day.

,

Take care to address any acne issues that you are having on your face, and don't forget to treat breakouts on your back and chest. Prom dresses can be revealing, so you want to address these areas too.

If you are trying out any new skin care products, do so several weeks in advance in case your skin doesn’t react well to them.
Make sure to exfoliate with a gentle product every few days. Don’t overdo it! You don’t need to exfoliate every day – that is too harsh on your skin.
Do any eyebrow plucking and waxing several days before prom, not the night before or the day of. Otherwise, you might end up having some unsightly skin irritation to cover up., Getting ready for prom can be stressful. There are so many decisions to be made and you want everything to be perfect, which is understandable. But don’t take it too far! It’s too much pressure to put on yourself. Yes, you want to look great, but you also want to have fun at prom.


If you stress yourself out to the max, you’ll do nothing on prom night except worry over little details that no one even notices except you. Prom should be a night to remember, and you can’t make memories when you’re worrying about everything the entire time.
Avoid hitting the bathroom every 15 minutes to adjust your dress, perfect your lipstick or fret in general. Get out there and have fun!

, In the weeks leading up to prom, make sure you get a full night of sleep every night. “Beauty sleep” isn’t just a myth! During sleep, our bodies repair and heal. If you want to look your absolute best on prom night, make it a point to get plenty of rest beforehand.


Not only will you look better well-rested, but you’ll also feel better and have plenty of energy to enjoy the excitement of the night.

, Wake up, have breakfast, and start your preparations. If you start early, you can take your time and enjoy a day of primping and pampering. It’s never good to rush when you’re getting ready for anything, especially prom!


Wear a button down shirt or robe as you get ready, so that you can easily transition into your dress without messing up your hair and makeup.

, Take a long hot bubble bath and relax. Eat healthy snacks throughout the day to keep your strength up. Drink some herbal tea and keep your mood light-hearted.

, Make sure you watch the clock as you get ready. Even though you’re preparing early, it will start getting late before you know it! Make a schedule for yourself that morning when you’re relaxing in the tub, and stick to it.


Allot specific time slots for everything that you want to do. Give yourself 45 minutes for makeup, an hour for hair - whatever you need to make sure you get it done without rushing.
If you have appointments to keep with stylists or makeup artists, make sure that you arrive on time. Running behind on just one thing can throw off your entire day.

, You’re probably going to feel slightly nervous during the day, but also try to have some fun. Blast your favorite tunes and get yourself in the mood for a great night.


Prom isn’t all about looking great! You also want to have an amazing time and make wonderful memories. Listening to some fun music while you're getting ready will help keep you calm and get you looking forward to a night to remember.

Measure and pin the new hem place.,
Cut off the original hem.,
Take out the lower side seams.,
Roll a tiny hem and pierce it with the needle.,
Snap the presser foot into place.,
Stitch a few stitches.,
Feed the raw edge into the pressure foot.,
Sew along the remaining hem slowly.,
Replace the lower seams.,
Try it on.",How to Hem a Prom Dress1," Whoever will wear the dress needs to put it on, along with their shoes. A second person should fold the bottom hem up to the desired length, folding it so that the excess fabric is on the underside of the dress.Use a ruler or measuring tape to see how much from the original hem you are going to shorten. Pin this new hem in place by sticking sewing needles into the dress so the point of the pin is pushed from behind through the excess fabric, through the dress, and back into the dress and excess fabric a few centimeters away, so the pin stays in place. Pin all the way around the dress to check the new hem length.


The dress wearer should always put on the shoes that they plan on wearing to prom. The height of the heel will alter the length of the new hem.;
, Take a sharp pair of sewing shears and trim off the excess fabric at the bottom of the dress. You should leave about 1/4 inch (6 mm) between your new, intended hemline, and the raw, cut edge of the dress.Later, the rolled hem itself will be about 1/8 inch (3 mm).
If you cannot cut off the old hem while it is pinned in place, mark the new hem with a fabric pencil and take out the pins before cutting off the excess material at the bottom of the dress.

, Use a seam ripper to remove about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the stitches from the side seams of the dress skirt. These side seams are too bulky to feed through the rolled hem presser foot and will most likely jam up your entire machine.Save yourself the headache, and remove the side seams before making your hem.

, Use your fingers to roll a tiny hem along the bottom edge of the dress. Roll the hem so the jagged, raw edge is rolled inward and hidden.Hold down this rolled hem with your fingers, and place the hem onto the sewing machine. Carefully lower the needle into them hem, while still holding it in place.


The rolled hem should to be about 1/8 inch (3 mm) thick.Roll the fabric under so that the hem is hidden on the inside of the skirt and the raw edge is hidden under the rolled fabric of the hem.
The rolled hem will almost be composed to two small rolls: one to roll the raw edge in, and the end edge rolled on top of that.

, You will need a specific rolled hem presser foot to make a rolled hem on the dress.Keep the sewing needle in the down position and snap the rolled hem presser foot onto your machine.


Note that if you don’t have a presser foot that snaps into place and you need to screw it on instead, you will need to do this before you insert the needle into your hem.

, Choose a stitching thread that is relatively the same color as the dress. Be sure that your sewing machine settings are set to sew with a straight stitch.The outside of the fabric should be facing down, and the inside of the fabric should be facing up on the sewing machine. Slowly stitch about 3 stitches with your machine.You only need enough to get the hem started and to hold down the fold.

, Make sure that the needle is in the down in the fabric as you adjust the fabric. Use your fingers to feed the raw edge of the material into the curved, hooked piece at the front of the presser foot.This will keep the raw edge of the hem folding as you continue to move it through the sewing machine.


This curved, hooked piece will guide the raw edge and bring it under the fabric, rolling it into place as you stitch.
As a result, you will not need to hand-roll the remainder of the hem; the machine should do that for you.

, Continue sewing around the entire bottom hem of your dress. The presser foot should do most of the work, but use your fingers as you work to gently and slowly coax the fabric into the hooked, curved part of the presser foot. Make sure the fabric is feeding in correctly.The raw edge of the fabric should run parallel to the left edge of the presser foot, and the folded, hemmed edge should run parallel to the right edge of the of the presser foot.
If working in sections (you will be if you have side seams), you will need to start the process again with each new section.

, Once the hem is done all the way around the dress, pin the side seams you took out earlier, and sew them back together with a straight stitch., The wearer should try the dress on to check the appearance of the new hem. With this step, the process is complete.


Note that this is the recommended hemming method. Since most prom dress skirts are flared instead of straight, the material is not even all the way around the bottom. A basic hem will lead to bunching since so much material gets hemmed up. With this technique, however, you are hemming the dress using as little material as possible, so there is very little risk of bunching the fabric.

, Prom is the time to go all out - even if the person you are asking is a longtime girlfriend or boyfriend or simply a friend.

, If there is a ""Prom Committee"" to help the school prepare for this event, you may be interested in joining or even by simply giving feedback on what you'd like to see done for that day.

, Factors to consider include upbeat dance music for the beginning of the evening, some relaxing movie for rest times and the slow, weepy stuff towards the end.

, You’ll want to take pictures together to remember this night forever!

, You don't want to have any stray hairs sticking to your dress or your dates!

, Look in thrift stores or at sales before prom season to find an awesome dress that works for you without completely breaking your budget.

, Get used to walking in them and break them in before prom, so that you will not have to deal with blisters and bloody, aching feet on the night of prom.


Dark or simple colors are usually a safe bet, although it depends on the theme. You probably don't want to wear a hot pink dress to a haunted house themed dance, but it would be fine if the theme were neon lights.

, This is especially important if your school is a big one or many schools are having prom on the same weekend.


Wash your hair. Use a good-smelling shampoo and a hair conditioner. Then use a bubble bath for your body. Before your hair dries, use a hair mask to protect it. Dry and then comb them. Later, after you've gotten everything else ready and before the prom, you can go somewhere to get your hair done professionally.

, You can get a professional to do this, but it may be unnecessary and expensive if you can make yourself up by yourself.


Paint your nails. Choose a flattering color that matches your outfit. If you want your nails to look particularly glamorous, you can go to a nail salon and have them professionally done. At a nail salon, you also have to option to add fancy designs, which would be much more difficult to do if you painted your own nails.

, At first, use a face soap. Wet your fingers and massage the soap over your entire face. Wash out your face a lot of times. Use a peal-off mask to make your face look fresher. Wait about 25 minutes (or the time that is given on the mask packet), and then wash the mask off. Wax your mustache. Put some day cream on all your face and some eye cream under your eyes. Try not to use a cream that clogs up your pores., Give yourself enough time on the night of the prom to fix your hair, your makeup, and to put on your dress.

, Make sure you have your ticket, photo ID, some money, lip balm, and anything else you might need.

, You can help each other with hair and makeup – it’s lots of fun and will take much less time than if you tried to do it all yourself. You can even turn up together and have strength in numbers for a ""wow"" of an entrance!

, Make sure you have arrangements to get home safely and take care not to get in a car with anyone who is intoxicated.

, Remember to just have fun!

, This will ensure that any tux rental shops in your area still have an appropriate size and fit for you. Consider asking your date about the color of their outfit so that you can match.

,, You should order it early so that you can ensure that the shop does not sell out.

,, Go easy! Make sure that the smell is not overpowering.

, Apply some sort of product - gel, mousse, hair clay, serum, pomade - to make it look shiny and soft. Go easy, though - too much will make it look greasy. A dime-sized amount should be more than enough. If you get a haircut before your date, schedule it for three or four days before the event so that you don't have little hairs in your ears or on your neck.

, Trim your nails and rub lotion over your hands to make your hands look more presentable.

, After you've brushed your teeth, put the toothbrush on your tongue and gently scrape it. Then floss around every tooth. This is especially important if you have braces - you don't want your date noticing any food stuck in your mouth when you first show up. Finish with mouthwash.

Realize and accept that you probably did not miss out on as much as you may think you did.,
Remember that a lot of successful people in society weren't exactly prom queens (or kings) either.,
Choose not to let it consume your life.,
Consider the experiences you have had that those who went to prom may have missed out on.,
Give yourself an experience that most others don't have.,
Attend a formal event that is open to the public.,
If you are currently in college at a residential campus, consider going to formals.,
Don't be afraid to create your own ""prom experience"" if you still feel the need to do so.,
If someone else caused you to miss your prom, try to forgive them if at all practical.,
Think of it this way- You saved lots of money!",How to Get over Having Missed Your Prom1," Sure, it's fun, it's even quasi-fancy, but in reality, for many people, prom is just a formal dance with a few cheesy decorations and parting gifts. A lot of people who went to prom say it was one of the best nights of their lives. But there are just as many others who say it was a waste of time and money, and would have rather done something more exciting. There is a saying that ""most people who went to prom wishes they hadn't, and most people who didn't wish they had.""

, Taylor Swift, Mila Kunis, Madonna, Owen Wilson, James Franco, Mena Suvari, Uma Thurman, Conan O'Brien, Diane Sawyer, syndicated radio host Delilah, and Drew Barrymore never attended their official senior proms - though Swift later attended someone else's, in addition to her record company throwing a prom-themed party for her when she got her first platinum album; and Barrymore has hosted a ""prom party"" on at least two separate occasions.

, It's not the end of the world. Although it can be a fun and exciting experience, prom is not usually an event that defines the rest of one's life. Often times, people who were popular in high school lead fairly dull adult lives. Just as there are many celebrities who didn't go to prom, there are many prom kings/queens who sell insurance or work at the local supercenter.

, True, Madonna was never prom queen. Then again, how many prom queens had platinum albums? You may have had an experience that few others get to have for themselves. Make a list, and refer to it whenever you feel blue about not having prom pictures or memories.

, This does NOT necessarily need to be anything even closely related to a prom. Maybe this is getting tickets to see your favorite rock band perform live, or taking a Greyhound to Hollywood to see the Walk of Fame. Save up some money if you need to, and treat yourself with rare experiences like these.

, This might give you just the closure you need. Nearly every major city has some kind of formal events that are accessible to the public. This could be anything from a charity ball for breast cancer or child abuse awareness to a film festival's opening night gala, depending on what your city or area (or one you're willing and able to travel to) has to offer. For instance, most film festivals have an opening night gala that is either formal or semi-formal. These usually get publicity on the evening news or in local media. You can dress up just as formally as you would for a prom - and you'll be helping a good cause. A prom is basically just a formal event, in all honesty.

, They are usually sponsored either by ballroom dance clubs and/or by fraternities or sororities, but many in fraternities/sororities allow those outside the Greek system to attend as well. Call a friend up and invite him/her to the event.

. If your campus is not known to have formals that are open to all students, check to see if there is a ballroom dance club, and if there is, if they are aware of competitions., A section has been added below with ideas. Don't worry about feeling silly, or what others (friends, family, etc.) think of your decision. There is nothing wrong with giving yourself the closure you need, no matter what anyone tells you.

, This may be hard or impossible depending on your situation. If your parents wrongfully grounded you five hours before the prom for something you didn't do, and have since tried to make amends to make it up to you, perhaps it is time to let it go. If your brother sold your dress to a pawn shop the day of the dance to buy drugs, that may be a different story, depending on whether he's turned his life around and made things right with you.

, You did not have to buy a fancy dress,rent a tux,or get over priced photo packages. All your friends are probably broke,while you might have some money left over.

Measure the new hem and remove the old hem.,
Fold and press the raw edge.,
Fold and press the remaining excess.,
Attach a blind hem foot to your machine.,
Fold the hem under as you place it on the machine.,
Sew along the folded edge.,
Try on the dress.",How to Hem a Prom Dress2," The intended wearer should put the dress on while a second person measures how much of the fabric needs to be hemmed up from the bottom. Use pins to hold the newly measured hem in place, and have the dress wearing remove the dress. When the dress is taken off, cut off the excess fabric using sharp sewing shears. Leave 1 inch (2.5 cm) of excess material from the new, intended hem.


The wearer should try the dress on while wearing her prom shoes. Heel height will make a difference when determining how low the hem should go.
You can simply measure the length of the hem with measuring tape and cut away from there, but if you want a more even hemline, you should mark the desired hem all the way around using straight sewing pins or a fabric pencil.

, Fold the raw edge at the bottom of the dress up, and inward, hiding it along the inside of the dress skirt. Say you have about 2 inches of seam allowance. You should fold up roughly 3/4 inch (2 cm) of the raw edge of the fabric.Use a hot iron to press the new crease into place.


You may need to turn the skirt of the dress inside out in order to fold and press evenly.
At this point, you should not put any pins in place.

, Fold up the remaining 1¼ inch (3.2 cm) of excess material in the same direction as your original fold. Press the folded edge in place with a hot iron.The raw edge you previously folded should now be hidden along the inside of the second folded edge. Once again, make sure that the folded material will be hidden along the inside of the dress.
It is recommended that you pin the new hem in place at this point. Place the pins along the hem so that the tops of the pins face toward the body of the dress and away from the edge of the hem., Snap or screw on the blind hem foot as required for your sewing machine. This special presser foot is necessary to complete the hem on your machine.Note that your sewing machine must also be set to make a blind hem stitch. Again, refer to your machine's instructions to determine how to do this.

, Take the dress to the machine with the fabric wrong-side-up. Flip the folded hem under the main fabric, so it’s positioned just to the outside of your presser foot.With the fold hem flipped under, leave a narrow lip of the hem's edge peeking out from the side.


Note that the tops of the pins will no longer be visible, but they will be facing toward the machine from underneath the fabric.

, Be sure that you are stitching with a thread that is relatively the same color as your dress. Slide the fabric beneath the blind hem foot and place the flange (the middle section of the foot that is often darkened or colored differently to distinguish it from the rest of the foot, and acts as a guide) against this new folded edge.When the needle drops, make sure that it sews into the remaining hem edge sticking out from the side of the fabric. Sew all the way around the hem until you finish it.


Most of the stitches will run along the hem's edge, and every third or fourth stitch will catch onto the main piece of fabric. Most of the stitches will go through the ¼ inch of the edge of the hem that is sticking out., When done, open the hem and straighten out the seam, gently stretching the hemmed stitches so that the material lies as flat as possible.Press with a hot iron to smooth out any creases and try the dress on to verify that the new hem looks good. This completes the process.


Note that a blind hem will hide more of the thread than a standard hem will, making it a better option for prom dresses and other formal dresses than a standard hem.
If the skirt flares too dramatically, though, or if you create too large of a hem, you may still notice a little bunching along the folded hem.

Consider throwing a ""prom party"" for yourself.,
Find and attend an ""Adult Prom."",
If you live in or near a film production city, consider trying to get a job as an extra in a movie with a prom scene.",How to Get over Having Missed Your Prom2," Drew Barrymore and Taylor Swift both famously did this (Swift also went as a ""prom date"" for a football player who won a contest). Sure, it might a little self-absorbed, and will probably be expensive, but if it will give you closure, and it's within your means to do so, then go right ahead. Most people who do this tend to either hold it at a community center or make arrangements to rent out the local high school gymnasium during the summer. If you really have money to burn, you can rent a hotel ballroom (like a lot of high schools do now anyway), hire an event planning service to do all the work for you, and make it extremely realistic. You can even have yourself crowned ""prom king"" or ""prom queen"" if you are really feeling self-indulgent (hey, it's okay if you're paying for the party, right?);
, Before you get creeped out by the terminology, NO, an ""adult prom"" is NOT an X-rated version of a prom. It's a party that exactly resembles a prom, but marketed toward adults who are either looking to re-live their prom night, or make up for a missed prom. They often go out of their way to be realistic, even crowning a ""king and queen"", You can also do an Internet search on ""adult prom"" to see what the options are in your area.

, Before you cross this off as a completely ludicrous idea, consider the following. Movies with prom scenes are typically shot at least 20 times a year in cities with film industries. This works best if you can reasonably pass for prom age, and/or if you'd be willing to play a ""faculty"" extra rather than a ""student"" extra. It's also only really an option if you live in or near a city where films are regularly produced (i.e. New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Vancouver) Keep in mind that auditions probably won't be held during prom season - prom's a popular topic, and a movie that is released in the spring, in time for ""prom season"" is usually shot 6 to 18 months ahead of release.

If your high school holds an ""alumni prom"", attend that.,
Attend your high school's upcoming prom if they will allow you to.,
Go to someone else's prom as their date.,
Volunteer to be a prom chaperone.",How to Get over Having Missed Your Prom3," Some high schools hold special ""alumni proms"" (not to be confused with reunions) as fundraisers - alumni and faculty are allowed to attend. These events are usually semi-formal to formal.

, Some high schools allow alumni to attend prom if they wish to do so. Others may require a little coaxing (usually in the form of a donation). Late Wendy's founder Dave Thomas had dropped out of school to serve in the military, but later got his GED 35 years later, and went to his high school's next prom with his wife that year. Many schools not only allow, but encourage alumni to attend future proms. Don't expect to be crowned king or queen - you won't be eligible, and even if you were, would that really be fair to this year's class? - but at least you'll have a prom. This option will work best if you have a really good reason for having missed your prom (military service, etc.), and/or if you are in the financial position to make a reasonable donation to the school. Some schools don't care as long as you buy a prom ticket.

, Taylor Swift famously did this (in addition to having a ""prom party"" thrown for her after her first record went #1) and it was even the subject of an MTV reality show, where dateless high school boys were offered a chance to have her as their prom date. Now, unless you're famous, you won't be able to have your own reality TV show to find someone to take you to prom with them...but there are other ways to go to someone else's prom as their date. There are actually websites such as Prom Date Depot (www.promdatedepot.com) which allow people to find or become prom dates. Note - You may need to get special permission from the school in advance, and should always inquire with the school regarding their policy about prom guests. This may not be an option if you're older than about 20-24.

, Granted, this is not the same as actually going to your own prom, but high schools need chaperones at every prom, every year. Prom chaperones are responsible adults who attend the prom with the students to ensure the safety of the students attending, as well as to prevent improper conduct. You won't be all that popular, and forget about being crowned king or queen, but you'll be at a prom. Chaperones are typically parents of students and/or alumni, but most high schools will gladly take any extra volunteers for chaperones they can get. If you have a clean record, this might be a viable option for you.

Tear out pages for future reference. This way, you may be able to hone in on a pattern of things you are drawn to like a particular color or shape.

, In your free time, scour the web for ideas. Months before prom, stores will begin to highlight the fashions they carry. Visit your favorite store’s site, and find a few you’ve never heard of to widen your options.

, What better way to brainstorm ideas? Discuss with them how you visualized yourself during prom. They will undoubtedly have great insights into how to improve on your vision. Show them some pictures and consider their input.


It could be fun to all dress similarly. For example, everyone may choose to wear the same color scheme or go for a short dress, rather than a long one.

Pear: If your hips are larger than your bust, you probably fall into this category. When choosing a dress, find something that accentuates your waist and adds volume to your upper body. This will balance out your silhouette. Strapless dresses with full skirts are excellent choices.
Petite: Consider yourself petite if you are under 5'3"" tall. If you'd like to look taller, wear a dress with an asymmetrical hem. Floor length gowns may make you look smaller. Also, anything with vertical prints or pleating will elongate your frame.
Slender: If you are long and lean, definitely think about a fitted dress for the prom. If you'd like to create more shape, add curves and dimension by wearing asymmetric necklines and/or a belt.
Hourglass: This shape is defined as the bust and hips being proportionate to each other with a defined waistline. Look for dresses that create a wrap effect or have a fitted top. These will accentuate your favorite assets.
Busty: If you have a large bust and narrow hips, you may fall into this group. You can downplay your upper body by choosing a dress that adds curves along your hips. You can do this with ruffles or pleats., Even if your school doesn’t have one normally, a formal dance might be the exception. Find out what it is and stick to it. It would be awful to spend hours shopping, getting dolled up and then being stuck in the parking lot all night.


Find creative ways to work within the guidelines like bringing along a shawl or adding cute straps or cap sleeves to a strapless dress.

, You should get creative here. While you definitely want to visit the mall, think about alternatives like boutique shops or bridal stores. This can open your options to designs you may not have considered as well.


The same goes for online retailers. Think about looking into renting your dress or checking out a costume store.
Try this option if you want to save money. A thrift store dress, for example, will be unique, vintage and really inexpensive.This is a sure fire way to avoid showing up in the same dress as someone else.

, With all the excitement, it will be tempting to purchase the first one you try on but don’t make this mistake. Take your time and really enjoy the experience of finding the perfect one.


If you’re leaning towards an online purchase, find out if they will ship several for you to try before you buy. This will save you the heartache of committing, only to find out you hate the way it looks on you.

, The perfect prom dress will ruin your night if it’s pinching in places, too tight or practically falling down. You don’t want to spend the entire evening tugging at it or tripping over the train. Make sure it’s what you want and easy to maneuver in.


When trying on a dress, make note of itchy fabric or wiring poking you in the side. Ask the associate what can be done to remedy this discomfort.
While trying on the dress, try jumping up and down or dancing a bit to test the fit.
If you were planning to skimp on the alterations, it may come back to haunt you.

, If you are going to the prom with a date, find out what they will be wearing. Think about wearing matching outfits. For example, if they've chosen a blue suit, you can wear the same colored dress.


Keep in mind that you don't have to match from head to toe. You can wear accessories that match their ensemble or vice versa.

, Pick out your friend's dress and let her pick yours! Before you head out, swap 5-10 dress ideas online and plan a day-long shopping trip to try them on. They might come up with something glamorous and gorgeous that you may not have ever considered for yourself. The whole point is to have fun so give it a shot.


You can even bring your entire group of friends to get their advice. The more the merrier, right?
This could help take the pressure off if you're overwhelmed by all the options.

Prom dresses are a type of formal dress, but as far as formal dresses go, they tend to be on the more budget-friendly side. When picking out the perfect dress, you'll need to consider your own sense of style while also figuring out which dresses look best on you.


For more information about getting the right dress, see the separate section contained within this article.;
, Generally, you'll want to pick out your dress before you pick out the shoes you want to wear with it. When you choose shoes, keep in mind that they need to be comfortable enough to walk and dance in all night.


The way your shoes look is even more important if you wear a short dress since your shoes will actually be seen.
Don't be afraid to go for flats, but make sure that the flats you choose are classy enough to work with a semi-formal dress.
As a word to the wise, if you go for heels, choose low heels. Most girls can manage an evening in low heels, even if she has limited experience with such shoes. On the other hand, extremely high heels can be an accident waiting to happen.

, A little bling can transform your prom look from “nice” to “outstanding.” This is your chance to really glam yourself up, but make sure that the jewelry you pick out complements your dress instead of competing with it for attention.


Simple, elegant jewelry is usually recommended over flashy pieces. Look for clear gems like cubic zirconia or timeless options like pearls. Avoid pieces with color.
Try not to get too carried away. A flashy necklace, huge earrings, multiple rings, and heavy bracelets on both wrists can be overkill. Pick one piece to focus on—usually either the earrings or necklace—and choose a couple of other smaller pieces that match the general style of that focal piece without being quite as extravagant.

, You may have a few items that you want to carry with you, like your cell phone or compact. The best way to go about bringing these things is to find an elegant clutch purse that works with the color and style of your dress.


If you don't want to carry a clutch, though, you might be able to persuade your date to carry your phone and extra supplies in his pockets. Just make sure that this is okay with him before you take that option.

, For the most part, you may not need a shrug or sweater. Most proms take place during warm weather, and even if the temperatures are still a bit chilly, the temperature inside your prom venue will probably be warm enough. Still, if you get cold easily, it may not hurt to look for a sophisticated little shrug or wrap to drape across your shoulders.


Around prom season, you'll usually be able to find lightweight, elegant little wraps made of delicate materials like chiffon. These are your best option since they are both fancy and functional.

, Your prom date is responsible for buying your corsage, but you should talk it over with him beforehand so that he picks out something suitable. Also keep in mind that you'll need to buy him his boutonniere, and ideally, the two pieces should coordinate with each other.


Your corsage should complement the color of your dress but it should not be the same exact shade. Also, try to make sure that the corsage and boutonniere match each other in terms of color, flower choice, and overall style.

, Most schools have some sort of dress code that will dictate how revealing your prom dress can be. If you automatically gravitate toward styles that are modest and classy, this probably won't be an issue for you. On the other hand, if you tend to be someone who likes showing off a lot of skin, you should check into the dress code restrictions to find out what your school will let you get away with.


Prom dresses can either be long or short. If going for a long dress, make sure that the hem works for your height. If opting for a short dress, go for one that is no shorter than mid-thigh length. Any hemline shorter than that tends to drain all sense of elegance out of a dress.

, If you really want to look stunning, though, consider narrowing your choices down to a color palette that flatters your skin tone best.


If you have a ""winter complexion,"" you have pale white, yellowish-olive, or dark skin with blue or pink undertones. You may also have brown hair and dark eyes. Look for dresses with sharp colors, and opt for options like black, navy blue, red, and pink. If lighter colors are your thing, look at icy tones instead of pastels. Avoid beige, orange, and gold.
If you have a ""summer complexion,"" you have pale pink skin with blue or pink undertones. You may also have blonde or light brown hair and pale eyes. Look for pastel colors and soft neutral colors with rose or blue undertones. Consider dresses that are lavender, plum, rose-brown, or soft blue, but avoid black and orange.
If you have an ""autumn complexion,"" you have skin with a warm golden undertone. You may also have red or brown hair and golden-brown eyes. Look for colors with similarly golden undertones, including camel, beige, orange, gold, and dark brown. Avoid blue tones, like navy.
If you have a ""spring complexion,"" your skin is creamy white or peach with golden undertones. You may have straw-colored or strawberry-red hair, as well as blue or green eyes, freckles, and rosy cheeks. Warm colors like camel, peach, golden yellow, and golden brown are your friends, but dark or dull colors should be avoided.

, As with color, the cut and style of dress you choose is ultimately your choice. Certain styles do tend to flatter some body types more than others. However, girls of all body types can find a cut that looks great.If you have a pear shape, your upper body tends to be smaller while your hips are a little more shapely. Show off your tiny waist with a fitted top and balance out your curves with an A-line skirt.
For a straight, slim figure, create the illusion of curves by drawing attention to the waist with a wrap dress or belted dress. You could also draw attention to the bust line with a deep v-neck, or opt for a dress that bells out at the bottom.
If you have an inverted triangle shape, you tend to be a little bustier than most girls. Make sure that the dress you choose offers a decent amount of support up top, and balance out your curves by drawing the eye to the waist or the lower hemline.
If you have an hourglass figure, both your bust and hips are curvy and your waist is notably smaller. You have a lot of options to work with, but since you are blessed with a naturally well-proportioned figure, you should try to avoid dresses that place too much emphasis on either the top or bottom of the dress.
If you have an apple shape, your midsection tends to be a bit on the wider side. Dresses with an empire waist are great at drawing the attention to the skinniest part of your waist while masking the wider areas.

, You should feel both beautiful and comfortable in your prom dress. If you sacrifice one for the other, you may not get as much out of your prom experience as you otherwise could.


In addition to being physically comfortable, you also want to be mentally comfortable. If you think you'll be dancing a lot, you might want to consider an option that has wide straps capable of holding the top in place., Prom is a semi-formal event, so you'll either need a tuxedo jacket or a suit jacket that can mimic the tuxedo look. An actual tuxedo jacket will make you look sharper, but suit jackets are the cheaper option.If you do go with a tuxedo, rent instead of buy. Tuxedos are expensive, and since you're still growing at this stage of your life, you'll likely only use this piece once.
At the rental place, let them know that you are looking for something with a modern fit.
Go with a plain black jacket, regardless of whether you use a tuxedo or a suit.
The jacket should either have a peaked lapel or a shawl collar, and the lapels can either be faced in black satin or in the same fabric as the rest of the jacket.
Also make sure that the jacket has a buttonhole for you to place the boutonniere in.

, You need to wear dress trousers that match your jacket perfectly. In other words, your trousers need to be in the same shade of black and made from the same material as your jacket.


Ideally, if you are going with a tuxedo, the trousers will have a satin stripe down the outside of each leg.
Formal trousers are traditionally held up with suspenders instead of belts.

, For a traditional look, go with a shirt that has pleats. For a more modern look, opt for one without pleats. If you aren't sure which you prefer, try both on and figure it out from there.


Also take cuff style into consideration. Barrel cuffs are simple and usually found on just about any buttoned dress shirt. French cuffs are a little more fancy.
For your collar, you have the normal lay-down collar type, or you could go with a wing tipped option. The latter has stiff, elevated types. If you aren't sure about which looks best, ask for advice at the rental shop.

, For prom, go with a bow tie instead of a long tie. Opt for a standard bow tie and, unless you are especially clumsy with your fingers, go for a tie that you have to tie yourself instead of using a clip-on version.


Regarding color, the safest bet is always black. If you know what your date's dress will look like, though, you might be able to pull off a tie in a coordinating color.

, Any plain black dress shoes should work for prom. If you own some already, get them cleaned and shined and simply stick with those.


You could rent formal black pumps at a tuxedo rental store, but you'll never know how stiff these shoes are, and really stiff shoes that have never been broken in can be very uncomfortable after a night of standing or dancing.

, The most traditional option is a simple black satin cummerbund, but if you want something a little less formal, you could also opt for a black satin vest. Pick one or the other, though.


If you are a little more daring, you might be able to pull off a cummerbund in a color other than black. If you go this route, though, choose a somber color over a bright one and make sure that it coordinates with your date's dress.
Avoid colored vests.

, If you have all of the items already mentioned, you're basically already set. There are a few additional accents you may want to consider if you really want to take your look over the top, though.


Choose the right shirt studs and cufflinks. The shirt studs and cufflinks should either match each other or complement each other. Avoid mixing silver and gold metals.
Also consider wearing a pocket square. Pick out something that will match your personality while remaining classy, and make sure that the color and material complement your date's dress instead of clashing with it. If all else fails, though, a plain white pocket square is a safe choice.

, Your prom date will be responsible for picking out your boutonniere, but you might want to talk things over with her first to make sure that the two of you can find something suitable. Also note that while she's buying your boutonniere, you'll need to pick out her corsage.


Both the boutonniere and corsage should match in color and style. Make sure that you and your date pick out pieces that use similar flowers and designs.

Enjoy the dance.

",How to Dress for a Formal Ball (Girls)," It will often state the dress code, making choosing an outfit easier for you. Also, knowing the type of dancing will help to determine the style of dress and footwear that is appropriate for you. Consider the following:


Consider a ball gown or cocktail dress - but don't feel limited to those choices. Generally, ball gowns are long and reach the floor. On the other hand, cocktail dresses are shorter, typically just above the knee. Both would be appropriate for a ball for tweens and teens.
A good quality shirt and skirt would be acceptable in place of a dress.
Slow dances, including waltz styles, would allow you to wear full ball gowns and high heels. However, nice dress shoes are also fine, as you don't need to look taller or fall over.
Disco style dancing would be best with shorter dresses and lower heels or flats, for ease of movement.
Always put practicality at the forefront––ask yourself such things as whether you can you move with ease, will your hair stay in place, is the dress going to be flexible enough, and so on.;
, This is especially important if the ball is being held at school, a church, or run by a parent's committee. Avoid trying to dress as if you're an adult; enjoy the freedom that comes with looking young and not having to try too hard., Who are you trying to impress? Your friends, your boyfriend/girlfriend, the whole school? This can have an impact on the style of dress and how glamorous you make it.


Check out what your friends will be wearing. This might help you to decide on clothes that are similar to theirs––or perhaps you'll get something completely different! It just may be helpful to know what their outfits are going to be.
Consider the venue. If there are cobble stones high heels would be risky. For a church hall, mini anything would be considered inappropriate.

, Ensure that the dress suits your figure. See How to dress for your body type for more details.

,


Buns look ladylike if neat, youthful if messy.
Loose hair is sweet and princess like.
Wavy: Girly and glam.
Ponytail: Quick, simple and pleasing.
Braid: Very pretty, especially on the side.


Make sure your hair is smooth, and accessorize. It may sound odd, but tiaras may suit the occasion, especially with a slow dance or waltz event.

, Earrings, necklace, bracelets, anklets, etc. However, beware of going overboard with them. One or two pieces should be fine.

, A handbag or purse might look nice.


Fill your purse with essential items only, such as feminine items if needed, a little touch-up make-up, your cellphone, mints/gum, and some extra lip gloss.

, What about gloves? How about tights?,"
"
Plan to choose and purchase your prom dress around four to six weeks before your prom.",How to Choose Your Prom Dress1," Many formal gowns (including prom dresses) require alterations for a perfect fit, and you will want to allow enough time to complete these alterations.


If you don't get to buy a prom dress before the listed time, then just shop for a ready-made dress you would love to wear on your special night. There will always be a dress you like, even if it isn't a very fancy one.

Analyse your skin's surface tone and undertone.,
Look at the color of your veins.,
Take a closer look at the irises of your eyes.,
Try on silver and gold jewelry.,
Determine how your skin reacts in the sun.",How to Choose the Color of Your Prom Dress According to Your Skin Tone1," Your skin tone is the surface color of your skin and is usually the word you use to describe your skin color (ex. Ivory, light, medium, dark). Your skin’s undertone is the color underneath the surface. It is possible to have the same surface skin tone as someone, but different colored undertones. When shopping for a dress you should take both the surface tone and undertone into consideration. Undertones are typically broken down into three categories: cool (pink, red, or bluish), warm (yellow, peachy, golden), or neutral (a mix of warm and cool).;
, One way to determine your undertone is to look at the color of your veins. Roll up your sleeve and look at the veins on your wrist. Do they look blue or green? If your veins look blue you likely have cool undertones and if they look green you likely have warm undertones. , Your eye color can also help determine your undertones. If you have blue, gray, or green eyes you likely have cool undertones. Alternately, if you have brown, hazel, or amber eyes you likely have warmer undertones. , Typically people with cool undertones look better in silver jewelry and people with warm undertones look better in gold jewelry. Which do you prefer on your skin tone? , Another way to figure out the undertones of your skin is to see how your skin reacts to sun. If you burn easily you likely have cool undertones. If your skin tans in the sun you likely have warm undertones. It is possible to have light skin and warm undertones in the same way that you can have dark skin and cool undertones. People with fair skin color who burn likely have cool undertones.
People with medium/dark skin color who burn and then tan likely also have cool undertones.

Get some inspiration.,
Look for precious fabrics.,
Plan your budget for your prom dress and begin saving as soon as possible.",How to Choose Your Prom Dress2," Check out different trends that are on the catwalk lately. Look through some magazines to see what you like and dislike about this season's dresses. You might also look at what celebrities are wearing to red carpet events, and use these things to inspire you but don't fret if you cannot match their looks, these are just for inspiration.


Start looking at fashion magazines and stores as early as three to four months before your prom.
Use the internet and take notes on your favorite styles. You may just be able to find a similar prom dress in your local boutique. If you don't, don't fret. There will always be a pretty dress somewhere out there.;
, For your prom dress, look for precious, fine and luxurious fabrics such as satin, tulle, silk, chiffon, lace and velvet.

, Be sure to allow extra cash for small accessories like hair clips, pantyhose, and make-up.

Focus on matching the dress to your face and body shapes, to ensure the ideal look and fit, therefore making your job of finding a dress easier.,
Consider your face shape in order to choose the perfect neckline If you have an oval face, then you are blessed with what it is considered to be the ideal face shape - forehead wider than the chin, cheekbones slightly prominent and face delicately narrowing towards the chin, which is narrow and oval.,
Know your body shape and how to match it to the perfect cut.",How to Choose Your Prom Dress3," Finding out what your face and body shapes are will help you to match these to the ideal dress, one that flatters and accentuates all of your good features, hiding anything you might consider a flaw. The steps in this section will help you to match your face and body shapes to your dress style.

, This means that you can choose any type of neckline you like.


If you have a round face (as wide as it is long, a little narrower at the forehead and jawline), you should look for a prom dress that elongates your face to make her look more oval. V-necks, Queen Anne and Empire necklines, sweetheart and scoop necks suit best your oval face. Always avoid high neck dresses and supersized necklaces, as they tend to hide the neck and therefore make your face look even more round.
If you have a triangle face (wide jaw line, narrow forehead), look for necklines with a stronger vertical shape that can add curves to your face: Sabrina necklines, scoop necks, sweetheart necklines and cowl necks.
If you have a heart shaped face (sharp and oval chin, slightly prominent cheekbones, wide forehead), you need to make your face look wider, so opt for necklines that draw a horizontal line near the neck: high or wide necklines.
If you have a square face (square jaw line, forehead, cheekbones and jaw having the same width), the perfect prom dress for you should have a vertical shape, so look for scoop necks, Sabrina, sweetheart, cowl neck styles, and always avoid square necklines.
If you have an oblong face (prominent chin, forehead, cheekbones and jawline having the same width), look for prom dresses with necklines that can make your face look wider and more oval: round, wide, Sabrina and cowl necks. Also, stay away from V-neckline dresses.

, You could be an apple, pear, hourglass, vase. There are various different categories for body shape and you can find your body shape by reading: How to determine your body shape. To match the body shape and dress, here are some suggestions:


If you have an hourglass body shape (well-defined waist, torso and hips having about the same width), look for prom dresses that accentuate the waist and keep a perfect balance between tops and bottoms: if they have sleeves, a full skirt is required; if the top of the dress is tight, the skirt must also tightly follow the hips and thighs.
If you have a rectangle body shape (no defined waistline, shoulders, bust and hips having the same width), you need to define your waist and add volume on both your upper and lower body. The best prom dresses for you are draped dresses with a defined waist and full skirt, Empire dresses, A-lines and any dress with a full skirt, ruffles and folds.
If you have an inverted triangle body shape (little waist definition, shoulders and bust larger than the hips), you must add volume to your lower body in order to draw attention away from your broad shoulders. You can create the hourglass silhouette illusion by wearing Empire line dresses, A-lines with deep V-necks, wrap dresses with a higher waist and other dresses with full skirts and details or embellishment on the hips.
If you have a pear body shape (torso and upper body smaller than the hips), you must make your silhouette look like the ideal hourglass figure, so look for prom dresses that draw attention to your shoulders and bust and reduce your lower body: A-line dresses, wrap and draped bust dresses, as well as prom dresses with well-defined waist and embellishments that draw attention to your upper body.
If you have an apple body shape (little or no waist definition, upper body wider than the hips), you need dresses that can create the illusion of a slimmer waist while keeping the right balance between the upper and lower body: Empire and A-line dresses with simple tops and a low and wide neckline (scoop, square, sweetheart).

Decide on the color.",How to Choose Your Prom Dress4," Different colors tell people what your personality is, like if you choose a bright red, then people would think you were bold and the centre of attention. If you choose black, sophisticated; blue, confident; pink, fun; purple, bubbly. It's all about what image or mood you want to show. It's also about what color you look flattering in. Some girls look better in blue, some in red. For example, girls with long brown hair and brown eyes might do well to avoid the color yellow. It really depends on your hair color, figure, eye color, face shape, mouth size, and eye size.


Look for special colors. Black and white are classic chromatic options when it comes to special occasions outfits. The first is elegant and mysterious, the latter is romantic and pure.
A red prom dress is perfect if you are looking for a sensual and passionate look, while gold and silver are always a good idea when it comes to party outfits.
Bright prom dresses are modern and eye-catching, but choose only one bright color if you don’t want to end up looking like a clown. Or you can always pair a bright purse, jewelry or pair of shoes with a neutral or pastel shade dress.

"

Start looking out for the actual dress, now that you know what you want.,
Try on dresses in a variety of different styles and cuts to find the one that works best for your body.,
Choose the dress.",How to Choose Your Prom Dress5," Ideally, you need to start this stage at around 4 to 5 weeks before the actual event. But, remember, if you see a really nice dress in the window, don't think 'that's the one' and just go in and buy it. You need to shop around because you might buy that dress and a week later see an even nicer one. Good things come to those who wait but the leftovers to those who procrastinate, so don't leave it too long.


Don't purchase your dress too far in advance, as before big events you can easily lose or gain weight, from stress or something else, such as periods, boyfriend troubles, stress, season (winter versus spring).

, You should already have done the work on the body shape, but here are some additional considerations:


If you have a slim figure, you may look best in a sheath-style dress that shows off your silhouette.
If you are curvy, you may want to consider an A-line dress that will highlight your waist and minimize your hips and thighs.
If you're short and petite, dress shopping may be more challenging; cocktail dresses become full gowns and party dresses become cocktail dresses. However, with plenty of time ahead, you can get these tailored to your size.
If you're looking for a longer dress, look for a short dress that is long on you. It will fit better and will fit you everywhere else without being too long.

, Once you have narrowed your choices to one particular prom dress style, try on that style in a variety of different colors and finishes. Although you should already have an idea of the preferred color, it can't hurt to do a final check for a glamorous shade that brings out a color in your face.


When choosing a fabric finish, keep in mind that shinier finishes will tend to show off figure flaws while matte finishes will obscure and diminish undesirable features.

"
"
Consider getting a dress tailor made for you.",How to Choose Your Prom Dress6," You might not like this idea of waiting around and you also might have a creative flair. If so, you could also design your own dress. You are probably thinking 'what?' but you could just sketch what you want on a piece of paper and take it to tailors to be made for you. Or, you can take in a picture of a dress and they can make a copy.


Do this at least four weeks in advance so that you have time to have it altered if needed.

Campaign.",How to Become Homecoming Queen," Homecoming queens are voted by their peers, so if everyone likes you, you have a good chance of being chosen. That means being nice, not fake. If you're nice to people but then talk about them behind their back, they still won't like you. Even if everyone else around you is saying bad things about someone, say something like, ""Guys, I hate talking about people, could you please stop."" This way, you're not being rude to them. Keep up the ""ultra-sweet-can't-help-but-love-me"" attitude and you'll see a difference.;
, Looks count. You don't have to be model-thin or anything, but do try to look attractive. Know what makes you look good, and what you should stay away from.

, Your look should be natural without looking like you've tried too hard.

, It gives off an air of self-confidence, ease, and chicness. That way you will know that people voted for you because they like who you are, not who you pretend to be.

, You want to be the girl everyone loves and this includes guys. If you have a boyfriend, though, don't flirt, that'll just get you a bad name. Regardless, remain equally friendly to everyone.

, Again, this will just get you respect and people will like you more. Remember that keeping your grades up is important so you'll even get to that homecoming. You may lose votes from those who consider those who slack academically ""losers.""

, In other words, don't let others tell you what or who to be. If you're shy, still be yourself but try to relax and be more outgoing. Learn to be assertive and confident.

, Try to relax, be more outgoing, and have fun around people. There's no reason why you should be nervous - try to see everyone as friends and treat them equally.

, Get yourself involved in a lot of activities. That way, you know a bunch of people. Join other extra-curricular activities in your school like dance, basketball, soccer, etc.

, Make an effort to get to know everyone, but don't become friends just to snag the homecoming crown. Be friendly, relaxed, and open.

, Towards teachers, principals, kitchen staff, janitors, peers, everyone! You won't only be respected by your peers but also your elders.

, No! To be the homecoming queen, you don't need the best date around. If you don't have a boyfriend to take, then go with friends. People will see this as you being confident. And if someone you aren't interested in going with asks you, don't be rude - turn them down with grace and gratitude.

, You can't win unless people know you want them to vote for you! Make your poster nice, readable, and not too flashy! An idea: Try doing something FOR the voters. Such as, giving out cupcakes to everybody at lunch, or, buy them hats that say vote for yourself. (But they don't have to be hats! they can be badges, jewelry,T-shirts, etc.) You could also stay simple and just say ""Vote for me!"" in the hallways.

Don’t drop these people after the voting is done, your reputation will turn sour as soon as the contest is over.;
, To meet others, have things in common, and show the school that you’re well-balanced and talented, take up a few varied extra-curriculars. To be a shoo-in for prom queen, it’s wise to be an athlete and an artist. And it doesn’t hurt to be in the environmental club either.


Sometimes the staff at your school can influence who makes it to the final nominations (yes, even high school can be rigged). The more they believe in you, the better your chances are to get through the red tape.

, Many schools require that you have good grades, are an active participant in school activities, and that you’re a model student that others should be emulating in order to be prom queen. It’s not just recommended, it’s necessary. Is your school like that? If you don’t know, it’s about time you find out!


This will establish a reputation for you as someone who would make a natural prom queen. After all, being ""queen"" is about leading your people, right? Show your school that you're a good leader and they'll be more inclined to vote for you.

, The absolute last thing you want to happen before prom rolls around is to get into trouble at your school. If you get suspended for any reason (poor grades or bad behavior), odds are you’ll be taken off any ballot, even if you were thought to be the clear winner. Don’t jinx yourself and make sure you’re on your best behavior; a real prom queen wouldn’t get into trouble anyway!


Whether it's not cheating on homework, getting caught climbing the school roof, or drawing an unfortunate picture of your least favorite teacher, don't do it. Right now, everyone else is your bread and butter. They've gotta be on your side, teachers included.

, You know how sometimes the staff have a say in who makes it onto court? Well, the prom committee has influence over their voters. They’re the ones that remind people how to vote and what kind of person to vote for. If you emphasize certain qualities that you have, you could subtly remind people how perfect you are for the job.


It will also show everyone how much this means to you. When they see the amount of effort you're putting in, they may be more moved to vote for you.

, In most schools, someone needs to nominate you and then someone else has to second that motion. That means you need at least two people who believe in you so thoroughly that they’ll go out of their way to make sure your name is on the list. Who do you have that you can count on? Ask your best friends if they’ll do this for you, and make sure you repay the favor later!


In some instances, you may have to trade a nomination for a nomination. This is only fair! Consider it friendly competition that will make the whole thing more fun and engaging.

, Especially in big schools, campaigning is key. It’s like marketing a business; if no one hears about it, no one will come. So get your name out there: have a stand at lunch, make posters for the hallways, even try to get your voice over the PA. The more people recognize you, the more you’ll be setting yourself up for prom queen branding.


Make sure you're allowed to do whatever it is you're planning on doing. Some schools have strict policies on what posters you can put up where and when, where you can solicit their students, etc.

, You know all those friends you have? Now’s the time to make sure your name infiltrates even the deepest, darkest dungeons of your school. Ask Jessica from the Go-Green Club to put up flyers in their workspace after class. Talk to Paul about distributing cupcakes to the football team. You want no stone left unturned!


This is when you should hit up all the new friends you've made over the last few months. Make sure they have t-shirts with your name on them, bracelets, keychains, and a baked good never hurts.

, Last but not least, people have a certain image in their heads of what a prom queen looks like. In short, she looks good, she smells good, and she probably feels good. Here are a few ideas to be her:


Shower daily and find yourself a “prom queen” worthy, signature scent to wear every day
Piece together your fashionable outfits carefully and wear make-up that compliments your overall look.
Keep your hair clean and sophisticated. Any style is good, so long as it’s clean and put-together.

, A prom queen would be nothing without the perfect prom dress. Ideally it is great for your shape, your color, and no one else is wearing it. It doesn’t have to be expensive, it just has to be perfect for you.


Consider getting a color that pops. You'll feel like the belle of the ball knowing all eyes are on you.
Get a cut that flatters your shape. Take whatever body parts you're nervous about make them work for you, not against you.
Get a dress that matches your personality. Who said you couldn't be a pig-in-a-blanket for prom?

, More pictures will be taken tonight than any other night of the school year, so get your hair and makeup perfect for the memories that are about to be made. Pile on the hairspray, too; it's not going to be a short night.


As for your makeup, it's no shame in doing it yourself. In fact, you probably know what looks better on you than a stranger does. Wear it a bit darker than what you normally wear. Smokey tones with light lips work great for prom.

, It’s the night you’ve been waiting for. Instead of spending the hours beforehand being so nervous you constantly need to pee, try to concentrate on this being one of the most exciting nights of the year. You’re going to have a good time and you know it. All your friends, food, and music; what's not to like?

, If you win the title, remember that you’re prom queen; a prom queen is gracious, friendly, and humble. Show everyone how much you appreciate their votes and that this means the world to you. In other words, let them know they voted for the right person!


Don't hesitate to thank those that you know voted for you. They'll know they made the right decision by how kind and genuine you are.

, Regardless of the turnout of events, it’s important to be all smiles whether you win or lose; after all, this is your prom! It’s fun just being there, getting dressed up, and dancing with your friends. You'll remember this day whether or not the title is yours, and you'll remember it as a rocking good time.


Besides, aren’t there a couple of other high schools’ proms you could crash? Hmm...

"
"
About a month or two before the dance, start letting people know that you would like to be queen.,
Earn the trust of the ""preps."",
As soon as people realize that you want to be queen, they'll vote for you.,
Try to get yourself involved in after-school activities.,
As the dance approaches, you will have to start deciding what dress you're going to wear.

,
By now you've probably made it onto the ballot.,
As soon as you walk in the door at the dance, smile and go hang your coat up.,
When they begin announcing the names of the King and Queen, wait and listen for your name.,
Dancing: If you have flabby arms, then put your arms around his back (not waist, that's what he is supposed to do!),
Show everyone that you are confident enough to dance with a boy.,
When the dancing is over, be prepared to have people come up to you and congratulate you.",How to Be Queen at Your School Dance if You're Overweight," Don't shout it, or put it very bluntly. Plant that seed in the mind of people that maybe you should be on the ballot. Begin with your closest friends, and slowly expand out of your circle.;
, People really do follow their lead. Don't say anything bad about them, or anyone else for that matter. You want people to like you and trust you. You need to plant the seed, and to do that you need to talk to a lot of people. You need to get them to realize that you deserve to have your name on that ballot.

, Of course, there are going to be haters and people that will flat out insult you.

, If you're sporty, join teams. If not, become the stat person for that team, or make friends with the best players.

,, This is when you have to step up your game. Try to get at least some of the ""preps"" to vote for you - if some do, it will have a 'ripple effect' of sorts on the rest. Smile a lot, and make sure you are extremely nice. Be sincere. If someone looks nice, compliment them. If some one drops all their books on the floor, help pick them up. Show people that you care about them enough, and they will vote for you.

, At some schools, the girls take off their heels so they can dance without fear of twisting their ankles or falling. Find your friends and start dancing! No one wants a wallflower as their queen. You don't have to shake it all over the place, but you shouldn't stand there with your arms crossed - people will think you're in a bad mood. Laugh and just let loose!

, When they announce it, go up to the stage and proudly accept your tiara. Flaunt a little, but don't go overboard. Smile broadly and face your peers.

, If your arms are toned, then it's okay to put your arms around his neck, but it's mostly dependent on what feels comfortable to you. There are going to be a lot of pictures taken of you, so smile and be pretty. Don't make faces. Some people will take a bad picture and post it on their My Space. Dance slow, try not to step on his toes, and stay close.

, If people are laughing and making you feel bad don't start crying or stop smiling.

, Sometimes, they might even take pictures. For the rest of the night, just dance and be yourself. Surround yourself with friends, not people who decide they want to know you because of your newly acquired title. If there is someone that is still being a jerk, don't lose your cool. Just listen to what they have to say, smile a pretty smile, and brush it off. They just showed their true colors, and you have to remember - They probably aren't being a 'jerk', they just have their own opinions. If they're yelling and obviously jealous, they're probably better ignored, but if they're calmly stating their opinion, then let it be.

Choose bold colours if you have a dark skin tone.,
Pick pastels for a light skin tone.,
Decide on earth tones and metallics for medium-colored skin.",How to Choose the Color of Your Prom Dress According to Your Skin Tone2," Bold and bright colors will really pop and complement your skin tone. Try jewel tones, such as turquoise, and emerald green. Pastels are another good choice and will make you stand out in a crowd. Avoid black and other deep tones.

, If you have a light or fair surface tone without freckles it is suggested that you try pastels. For example, pastel blue, mint green, periwinkle, baby pink, and heather gray will all complement your skin tone nicely. , If your skin tone is often described as olive you likely have a medium surface tone. You will look best wearing earth tones and metallics. For example, try gold, forest green, brown, mustard yellow, and cranberry red.

"
"
Choose earthy colors for warm undertones.,
Try blues, purples and greens for cool undertones.,
Determine your dress color based on a combination of surface tone and undertone.",How to Choose the Color of Your Prom Dress According to Your Skin Tone3," If you have decided that you have warm undertones the colors that will look best on you belong to the earth tone family. These include yellows, reds, and browns. Avoid icy shades and jewel tones.

, If you discover undertones of blue, pink, rose or purple, you're considered to have a cool skin tone. People with cool undertones look best in blues, purples, or greens. Avoid oranges and yellows.

, When you are deciding on your dress color it is important to keep in mind that your skin has both a surface tone and undertone. You could have dark warm skin or dark cool skin. Similarly, you may have light warm skin or light cool skin. Typically the surface tone will help you determine the shade of colour and your undertone will help you decide on the color itself.


For example, if you have dark skin you will look good in bold colours. If you have dark warm skin you may want to choose a bright yellow or red to compliment the warm undertones. If you have dark cool skin you will look best in a bright blue or silver.

"
"
Look through your wardrobe.,
Try on dresses in different colours.,
Shop with a friend or relative.",How to Choose the Color of Your Prom Dress According to Your Skin Tone4," If you're still at a loss for which colors will be most flattering for you, think back to the items in your wardrobe that have earned you the most compliments. Do people comment on how flattering a certain shirt or jacket is on you? Or do you get rave reviews every time you wear a particular scarf or accessory?


Look for common color trends among your favorite pieces – if all your compliment-worthy articles are red, it's safe to assume that this color will be a good pick for your prom dress.

, Now that you have determined your skin’s tone and undertone and have discovered which colors look best on you it is a good idea to try on a variety of these colors to see which one you like the most. Typically one dress and color will stand out among the rest and really make you pop. You will only be able to find this look by trying on lots of dresses!


Avoid having your mind set on one color. It is a good idea to try on a variety of colors. You never know what you will find.

, It is always a good idea to bring someone with you when you are shopping for your prom dress. They can provide their opinion and let you know which dress and color looks best on you. Asking a sales associate their opinion is another great idea. They are very familiar with the products in the store and can help with narrowing down your selections. "

Start shopping for shoes and accessories at least two months in advance of the prom or formal dance.",How to Choose Your Prom Dress7," This way, you can try on your shoes, bag, and dress all together at the dress shop. If you change your mind, you can at least return the bag and shoes if time allows, and you will only have to pay the lay away fee rather than getting stuck with an expensive dress no one else would necessarily want.


Shoes usually look best when they are of the similar color or suit the color of the dress. A nice pair of heels is good if you want to be a bit taller.
When it comes to jewelry, don't go overboard, too much can just ruin the look of the dress and make it look cluttered.

"
"
Sort out the perfect hairstyle to match the prom dress.",How to Choose Your Prom Dress8," While the opportunities are endless, don't leave the decision till the last minute. Are you thinking of dyeing it? If so, do this well in advance, ditto for a new cut. Some classic hairstyles are updos (they make the outfit look very classy and sophisticated) or long loose curls (they make you look fun and cute). A side bun makes for a quirky change.

"
"
Try everything on to check how it all comes together.,
Get ready on the night of the prom.,
To complete the look, don't forget that beautiful smile.",How to Choose Your Prom Dress9," A couple of weeks before your prom, try on your dress with your shoes, jewelry, make-up, and hairstyle to be sure you like the finished look. Walk and move around in your prom dress a little to give it a comfort check.

, On the night of your prom, put your dress and a ""cover-up"" (any clean shirt or jacket) on before applying make-up or styling your hair. This will prevent any make-up smudges or product stains on your fabulous prom dress.

, Wearing a nice prom dress is good, but if you are smiling it will make you look like the best person in there. Your confidence will go through the roof when you get all the compliments.

Don't dress like you're running for prom queen (or king.),
Decide whether it's appropriate to follow the prom theme.,
When in doubt, go the conservative route.,
If you're a man, wear a suit and tie instead of a tux.,
Keep comfort in mind.",How to Chaperone a Prom," Especially if you're over 25. Put that hot pink prom dress or that cheesy blue tuxedo back in the closet. Go conservative. Remember that you are representing the school when you chaperone a prom. There is nothing wrong with wanting to look and feel great, but don't do it at the cost of ruining the night for the kids there. Even if you missed your own senior prom, does that really make it right to steal their night to try to make up for it?;
, Just because the theme is ""Adventures Under the Sea"" doesn't mean you should show up dressed as a mermaid. If the chaperones have decided as a group to dress in theme, then you're OK, but if not, you will most likely regret your decision the moment you walk in the door.

, The only thing more embarrassing than seeing that one woman dressed in a hot pink ball gown is BEING that woman. Go conservative - you can still look nice, just don't steal their moment. Maybe a conservative little black dress or something classic in a springy color scheme. If the kids will be in formal wear, then you should too, but keep it under control.

, Men who are going as chaperones need not wear a tuxedo, and really should not. Dad's best bet is to go with a suit and tie—something he would wear to a business meeting.

, You will probably be on your feet most of the night, so choose shoes that won't have you hobbling halfway into the party. You may also be asked to stick around after the party to help tear down, so pick a dress or skirt that will allow you to bend and move somewhat easily.

"
"
Take time looking for your perfect dress (in advance).,
Don't try to squeeze into a dress that is too small for you just because you think that it is the size that you ""should"" be wearing.,
Eat a well-balanced breakfast to prepare you for your very long day.,
Go get your hair and nails done as well.

,
Tell yourself that you are ""special"" and that you are going to be ""gorgeous"".,
Make sure your family knows how important this day is to you.,
Stand up straight.,
If you're having trouble finding a date, don't immediately jump to 'oh, it's because I'm curvy' and get disheartened.,
If you can't find anyone you really like to go with, don't be ashamed to go with a few friends!",How to Be Confident Being a Curvy Teen at the Prom," First of all, decide what you think is your most beautiful feature, and find a dress that highlights it. If you really like your pretty blue eyes, pick a dress in a color that really makes them shine. If you are proud of your toned arms, pick a sleeveless dress, or if you have shapely legs, pick a dress with a slit. This will also help you be more confident, because you will be showing off what you like about yourself and therefore taking the attention away from the things you would like to improve.;
, You will just be uncomfortable and not able to breathe or bend the whole night. Remember, dress sizes don't really mean anything anyway. No one will ask you what size you are wearing, only you will know, and what does it matter? All stores run different. Go for a dress that fits your body and is comfortable, because you want to be able to dance the night away in comfort! You're much better off choosing a dress in a style that drapes, not form-fits. You'll be more comfortable and you'll look stunning! Just don't buy something obviously too big but still intended to be skintight- some areas will droop, exposing a few things that you might want to keep covered.

, Before you get dressed and made-up, eat something healthy and has carbs/proteins, like a turkey/tomato sandwich on rye bread. Why? It'll keep you from getting too nervous or jittery, as well as fill you so you don't have to eat most of the prom food (which is usually unhealthy in all the worst ways)

,, Because, if you think it- you will be!

, If they joke just ignore it or even better, take advantage of it... Joking could make you relax!

, If you're a curvy teen, then the fat will kind of slump out if you slouch. Shoulders back, too. If you have a big chest, wear a proper bra for the dress type- but always make sure it fulfills it's purpose. You want to look beautiful, not jiggly!

, Find a guy who you really like, but who likes you for you- not just your face or body. You don't want a date with a guy who will turn you down just because you're curvy like a goddess- would you want to be stuck with that guy for the rest of your life? Then don't go with him!

, This is a great night, but it won't be the 'best' night of your life unless you're having fun!

Require Sleeping Bags.,
Pull a prank on your guests.,
Set up some good food.,

Play some scary music.,
Dine on candy!",How to Have a Scary Halloween Sleepover," Usually this is about 6:00 PM. By the time everybody gets there, it'll most likely be 6:40 or something, so it'll be dark and perfect for horror.;
, You want it to be SCARY and full of FRIGHT, right? Play Bloody Mary or do a séance. A séance is where you get a candle, gather together in a circle and connect each other by holding hands, then light the candle and put it the middle of circle. Then, you choose someone to call a ghost from the other world. Maybe if somebody wants to contact their grandmother, say, ""Grandmother Maria, we awaken you from the other world to speak to you. Please show us a sign of your presence."" Or, ""Anita Josephs, we awaken you from the dead."" Or just say a deceased persons name ten times. If a séance seems too scary, try a Ouija Board. All you have to do is get a picture of the Ouija Board from Google and copy down the stuff on it to a blank piece of paper, get a bottle cap, hold it down and call a spirit, and they will talk to you through the letters., Nothing is better than a cold, frightening story that will leave you with chills. If you don't know any, go online and look for scary stories to read.

, A good example of movies would be Dead Silence, Bloody Mary, etc. If you have Netflix, choose from movies in the Horror Movies section., This is an important step. Where will your guests sleep? Sure, a couch MIGHT work, but when you wake up your neck will hurt! Make sure you have some extra blanket to make a bed for those who don't have a sleeping bag.

, During the night, wake up and whisper into each guests ear their names. To add the scary effect, trail your fingers up their arms so they think the ghost is there and ready to take them down.

, You can get some Halloween recipes online. It'll really be great.

, It completes EVERY slumber party, no matter what. But this time, do the SCARY VERSION. Dare them to go outside with a flashlight for a minute all by themselves. Dare them to stay in a dark room alone while you whisper from the outside their name. Truth them if they believe in ghosts, truth them if they have ever had a scary encounter, etc.

, Whether it's from your phone, laptop, etc. just play whatever! Or, you could play some classics like This Is Halloween. The BEST scary music is on youtube. Just search Coraline Soundtrack, click a song and let it play. It'll set an eerie feeling.

, Leave candy bags for your guests and munch on them till you fall asleep.

Do French-inspired activities:


Give each other French manicures and pedicures.",How to Have a Paris Themed Sleepover (Teen Girls)," Ask your parents how many friends you can invite, then make a list of their names. Don't invite people who you know are going to spoil your party - stick with people who have a good reputation.;
, You can find some Paris invitations on the Internet, or you can use websites such as Evite or Facebook. If you want to create your own invitations, open up a Word document and find Paris images and clip art to use. Remember to include the following:


A cute entry title, such as ""Venez célébrer mon 15ème Anniversaire à Paris.""
Whose party (yours, of course!)
When (The time and date)
Where (include your address)
What to bring
An R.S.V.P phone number or email address
Party details

, Send them 2-3 weeks before the party, as telling people about your party this far in advance will help to ensure that many people are able to come.

, Set up everything the day before the party. Use the colors pink, white, and black. Put pictures, wall stickers, or posters of the Eiffel Tower, l'Arc de Triomphe, etc on the walls. Because Paris is nicknamed ""The City of Lights"", hang up strands of white fairy lights and light candles around the party space. You could even use poodles or hearts - Paris is also the City of Love. Create cute props or get some from party stores.

, Tell your friends to wear chic dresses, high heels, buns, berets, scarves, bows, and cute purses. Alternatively, you could get them to wear clothes with the Eiffel Tower, French words, or ""Paris"" written on them. Try to find Eiffel tower accessories (such as necklaces, earrings, etc.) to wear as well.

, Because wine is so popular in France, serve sparkling juice in wine glasses. If you are able to spend a fair bit of money on this party, take your friends out to a French restaurant, or have a restaurant cater. For a thriftier option, prepare French food at home before your guests come, or you can all cook together. French meals often consist of 3 courses:



Hors d'oeuvres (appetizer): Serve things like baguettes, croissants, a cheese platter featuring French cheese (wine and cheese are very popular in France) a salad (such as salade nicoise), etc.

Plat principal (main course): Try ratatouille, frites (French fries), French onion soup, boeuf bourgignon (beef stew), etc. If you and your friends are more daring, you could also try escargot (snail), or frog legs.

Dessert: There are plenty of great French desserts such as chocolate soufflé, crème brûlée, éclairs, chocolate mousse, macaroons, chocolates, French pastries, and crepes. Crepes can also be a great French-inspired breakfast if your guests are staying overnight.

, Open a playlist on iheart.com, Pandora.com, Spotify.com, Playlist.com, or iTunes. You can also use YouTube or CD's. For a classic French feel, try songs by Charles Trenet, Yves Montand, Edith Piaf, Maurice Chevalier, Jacques Brel, etc. For a more modern feel, try songs such as ""Paris"" by Camille, or look up top-40 hits in France to find out what they're listening to now. Note that in France they listen to a lot of the same music that is popular in North America, so feel free to play popular English music as well.

, If those are hard to do, buy nail stickers to help.
Watch movies set in France. ""Monte Carlo"" is good for younger teens, and ""Moulin Rouge"" or ""French Kiss"" is good for older teens.
Learn some basic French words.
Give each other makeovers and take pictures wearing berets, Eiffel tower accessories, etc.

Pick a movie.,
Decide where you’re going to watch.,
Set up the display.,
Get comfortable.,
Watch the movie.,
Clean up after.",How to Have a Movie Night1," Whatever you’d like to watch. There’s really no wrong answer. Use Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Crackle, or wherever else on the Internet you like to get film.;
, Your bed, your couch, your favorite chair, the bathtub. You’ll want to make sure the area is prepped and ready to accommodate however you’re watching the movie. Whether it’s on a big screen or a small one you’ll want to make sure you’re ready to sit down for at least an hour or so.

, You’ll want to make sure your screen works and that you have sound before you start. Troubleshooting in the middle of a movie or just after you begin it is frustrating and can be easily avoided. If your display has pre-set color values make sure they’re suitable for the movie you’re watching, as an incorrectly calibrated display can cause colors to seem overexposed or lacking in intensity.

, Prepare your favorite snacks and drinks, pick a comfortable position, sit back, and relax. You should make sure you’re in an optimal viewing angle and that you are positioned within range of your speakers. If you’re watching multiple movies, queuing them in a playlist is a useful feature in most media players.


Make whatever food you enjoy. Popcorn is an easy and cheap snack for movies, and is extremely simple to make . You can go big as well and have an elaborate meal, but it adds to your cleanup and prep time considerably. Any drinks you enjoy should be stocked as well so you can stay refreshed throughout the movie.

, This is the easy part. Keep your eyes open and your ears unclogged. Have your phone on silent if you’d like to minimize distractions.

, It shouldn’t be a big mess depending on how low-key you kept your snacks. If you use the popcorn recipe provided, you should only have a bowl and a pot to clean up. Make sure you’ve swept the area for any debris and that it’s in the condition it was in before you used it.

Make jellybean bracelets.",How to Have a Jellybean Themed Sleepover," Draw a jellybean shape either on paper or using an online drawing program. If you do it on paper, use thicker paper or thin card. If you draw it online, print it out. Use this as the template for your other invitations; cut out the shape, then hold it over colored cardboard and draw around the shape. Repeat as often as you need invitations.


Inside, write the date, place and time, along with letting the guest know that this is a ""Jellybean sleepover"" and to bring along anything jellybean related if they'd like. Make bringing something optional, just in case this isn't easy for the guest. Also ask the guests to bring a sleeping bag, their PJs, toothbrush and a fresh change of clothes for the following day.;
, Use all the possible colors that jellybeans come in, there is not need to skimp!

, Draw or print out jellybean images. Use these to create such decorations as:


A garland or bunting made from jellybean images.
Posters with jellybeans all over them.
Hang streamers. Staple or glue the jellybean images to them.

, For example, you could have plastic jellybean figurines, money boxes or stuffed toys shaped as jellybeans as centerpieces, hanging decorations or just sitting around and adding to the theme.

, Stick pretty flowers into the jellybeans just before guests arrive. The flowers will last that night without water. Pull the flowers out the next day and put in water again.


Discard the jellybeans unless you are absolutely sure that the flower stems used are not toxic.

, This isn't essential but it's a nice way to say goodbye to your guests the next day and leave them with a cute memento and something sweet to chew on.

, Scoop out ice cream into a bowl. Stuff Jelly Belly beans into the scoops of ice cream. These make a great dessert or snack.


Good combinations include: Chocolate pudding with chocolate ice cream, tutti frutti with vanilla ice cream and cherry with chocolate ice cream.

, This can be eaten as a snack during any part of the sleepover.

, Make a cake, any kind, from round and square to stacked. Frost it, then completely cover it with jellybeans. This looks most effective when decorated in different ribbon layers of colors, like a rainbow.

, Add a spoon to each one. Arrange them across a buffet or snack table. Let the participants help themselves as they wish.

, Choose a favorite plain sugar/butter cookie recipe. Throw in 1/2 to 1 cup of jellybeans into the batter (depending on how much batter you have). Bake as per the recipe. The presence of the jellybeans inside the cookies will delight the sleepover guests.

,


Make a sugar cookie dough. Instead of making cookies, roll out the dough, then spread it across a standard or small pizza pan. If wished, line the pan with parchment paper to make it easy to remove the ""pizza"". Bake at the temperature suggested by the recipe, for about 7 to 10 minutes. Keep an eye on it; remove when it starts to brown.
Cover the top of the pizza with frosting (once the crust has cooled). A cream cheese frosting works really well.
Sprinkle with jellybeans. The color combination is entirely your choice (or ask the party girl or boy for a choice).
Place in the refrigerator. This helps the frosting to set. Cover to prevent fridge odors.
Serve whole for effect, then cut into slices. The kids will love it.

,


Buy lots of differently flavored types of jellybeans. The more, the merrier.
Place all of the jellybeans into a large bowl. Choose a bowl that can withstand being on the floor or being accidentally knocked by excited sleepover participants.
Blindfold each contestant.
Take turns in trying random jellybeans. The blindfolded tasters have to guess the flavor they're eating.
Have a referee keep a check on both the type of jellybean and its flavor. This person can also keep tabs on correct answers.
Tally up who gave the most correct answers. This person is the winner. Give a prize, such as a box of jellybeans.

,


Buy lots of different colors and/or flavors of jellybeans. Try to get both large and small ones.
Tip the jellybeans into a large bowl. Choose a bowl that can withstand being on the floor or being accidentally knocked by excited sleepover participants.
Write the colors and/or flavors of the jellybeans on lots of small pieces of paper. Toss these into a different bowl.
Have the participants choose a piece of paper. They have 5 seconds to find either the color or flavor of jellybean in the bowl. Everyone else counts down and then yells stop.
Each participant places the amount won into a candy bag or box, for keeps.
Continue until they're all gone. Participants can have fun seeing who managed to get the most.

,


Fill a jar or glass container with jellybeans, counting them as you go. Keep a note of the total amount of jellybeans.
Have all guests guess how many jellybeans are in the jar. Don't make this a timed game; instead, leave it out all night and the next morning for frequent observation. Let everyone know that they need to get their guesses in by a set time next morning.
Announce the amount of jellybeans the next morning. Award the entire jar to the person who got the most guesses. If that turns out to be your own child, be ready to scoop even amounts out into everyone's goodie bags, to avoid favoritism.

, For example, either the old or newer version of Charlie and The Chocolate Factory.

,


Measure the wrist. Participants could measure each other's wrists. Cut a length of embroidery yarn to reach this measurement with about an inch extra for tying a knot at the end.
Use a thick needle, such as a basting needle, to push a hole through the center of each jellybean. Younger children must have an adult do the needle pushing, but older children should be fine provided you've talked it through first.
The needles will need constant wiping in water to remove the sticky candy; have a bowl of water and paper towels to dry the needles as you go.
Thread the cut strand of embroidery yarn through a small needle. Push this through the hole to add the thread.
Keep adding the jellybeans until the bracelet is formed.
Tie a knot to keep the bracelet in place. The participants can eat off the jellybeans any time they like.

Pick a movie.,
Pick a time and a place with your friends.,
Decide what snacks and drinks you will provide.,
Set up the viewing area.",How to Have a Movie Night2," Since you’re with a group, you’ll want to pick something that’s a crowd pleaser. Consult with the people you’re sure you’re inviting, offer suggestions. Don’t be afraid to choose them yourself.

, Try to aim for the place that has the best ratio of seating space to screen size. In the event that you have space and a friend has a big screen or projector you could use, coordinate getting it. Make sure it’s compatible with your computer’s outputs and that you will have adequate sound, as many projectors and computer monitors lack or have weak, low-quality built-in speakers.


Set up an event online. If more people can come than you’ve invited then consider making an event on a social networking site and seeing who can come. You should avoid over inviting for your space and means for entertaining. Try to avoid annoying people with notifications and updates about the event by making your plans clear and firm when you make the event page online.

, If you aren’t providing food or drink, let your guests know in case they want to bring something. Make sure any allergy information or dietary needs are known by other invitees. You will want to do a cupboard-check and shop for anything you might be lacking.


If your night involves alcoholic beverages or other drugs, make sure your guests know about the rules of the space so as to avoid discomfort or strife with anyone you share the space with. Police and angry roommates can ruin a night very quickly and make a lot of people uncomfortable.
Serve easy snacks or premade drinks. Easy snacks include popcorn, hummus and vegetables, and nachos . Saving yourself time and effort will allow you to focus on details and keep the event fun and stress-free. You can avoid long queues of unserved guests and bolster the supply of snacks and drinks by keeping it simple.
Prepare any refreshments so that way they’ll be ready when your guests arrive, though popcorn is quick enough where it’s advisable to make it fresh for anyone who wants it. You can customize popcorn readily to a person’s satisfaction. It is also a good idea to make sure snacks are in a single area and that the area has any necessary utensils, dishes, and napkins.

, Place your seats in an arc around the screen and in rows to encourage a theater like experience. If you have the space and means, consider offering footstools so guests can relax and stretch a bit more than at the theater. Set up the home theater system you plan on using. Make sure the player you’re using has sound and video working when connected to your screen and speakers. Consider theming the space like a theater. The effect can be achieved with row seating, curtains, and movie posters in the space you’re using, and can delight some guests with your flair for decorating. Set up any game materials. A lot of people like to make games out of movie night, like movie quote bingo, movie trivia (before or after the movie), or a drinking game. These games often require printed materials, research, and some effort to assemble, as they are specific to certain movies quite frequently. Don’t underestimate the prep time on these.

Secure a projector, speakers and screen.,
Pick what to watch.,
Decide on where.,
Decide what you will provide food and drink wise.,
Invite your guests.,
Get adequate protection from insects and pests.,
Set up the space.,
Relax and watch the movie.,
Make sure the space is clean of all litter and equipment.",How to Have a Movie Night3," Projectors can often be checked out from school libraries, or bought secondhand if you don’t already have one. You can use any large, neutral-toned surface like a big sheet of canvas or a garage wall as a screen, though there are portable projector screens that are easy to set up. , Ideally this will be a movie that benefits from projection onto a larger screen, the kind of spectacular movie people like going to the theaters to see. Since you’re hosting outdoors, you’re likely to have more guests, and a crowd-pleaser is desirable to put butts in seats and keep them there.

, If you aren’t hosting it in your backyard, you’ll want to make sure you have legal access to the space at the time you host the movie night. Use permits for public parks and the aggressiveness of local police and park rangers vary depending on your locality. If you run into trouble, stay calm, have your ID ready, and be prepared to leave.


Make sure the weather permits for your event. No one wants them and their movie equipment to get rained on. Pick a day with a low change or precipitation and that isn’t going to be too windy so as to disrupt your screen. You can secure your screen with a well anchored frame against most normal wind activity.

, Consider that outside you won’t be able to prepare additional food and that drinks should be kept simple. Outdoor litter is difficult to manage and should be kept to a minimum, and depending on your area it might be a crime to litter. You will want to have materials for cleaning up with you and handy.

, Make sure they know the time, location, and are available and know whether or not to bring snacks and/or drinks. Make sure your guests know about any dietary restrictions other guests might have. An event page can help, especially if your location is out of the way or more difficult to locate.

, Mosquitoes, ticks, and moths will be an issue at night between the light source and large gathering of people outside, likely with food. You will want mothballs near your projector to keep them away from the light source. Citronella candles, bug spray, or a bug zapper lamp are all effective ways to manage more personal pests. , Make sure seats are arranged so that everyone has a good view of the screen and can hear clearly. Have a waste bin ready along with signs to the restrooms, and lay out any refreshments in one place to keep the area reasonably free of litter. If you are streaming the movie, make sure you have adequate signal outdoors to do so. Make sure your area is dark enough to project the movie with no glare or washed out colors.

, Your guests will attend to themselves mostly while the movie is playing. This is your chance to sit back and enjoy the fruits of your work for a while. However, you should make sure refreshments don’t run out and be prepared to handle your guests’ needs.

, Be careful when you break down your projector set up to avoid tearing the screen or damaging the projector. You’ll want to spend time making sure you left no litter in public spaces and that the equipment is all with its rightful owner. You should leave your outdoor space as clean as you found it or better.

Start in the summer.,
Mention your bid early on.,
Figure out the nomination process.,
Attend sports games and encourage the football team.,
Use cheesy trinkets.You can get small footballs, bouncy balls, or plastic toys at a dollar store.,
Ask people in person.Ask people in classes, in the lunch room, after school, and on the bus.,
Set up in the cafeteria with a poster and hand out candy.,
Use social media.,
Write a joke article.,
Convince people that homecoming is not just a popularity contest.,
Seek out people in multiple social circles or cliques.,
Take on responsibilities during school pride week.,
Stay in contact with multiple people and cliques.",How to Become Homecoming King," If possible, you should begin planning your bid in the summertime, since you will have more time on your hands. Make fliers and posters, and talk to your friends about possible strategies.


This can be fun. Make funny photoshopped pictures and memes and share them with your friends. Think about funny ways to distribute fliers or places to put posters.
Use the summer as an opportunity to branch out a little bit. Participate in activities that might bring your into contact with new people. Go to the library, go to concerts, and go to local parks.;
, Tell all your friends that you want to become Homecoming King. Try to tell your acquaintances as well. Be confident in your statements. if you are unsure about whether or not you should be king, other people will be unsure as well.


Don’t ask people if they will vote for you. Say, “I’m trying to be Homecoming King this year”. You should be making a statement, not asking a question.
Remember to tell your teachers as well. If some of your teachers are the key decision-makers in deciding who gets nominated, tell them first.

, Sometimes committees are in charge of creating and collecting ballots. Sometimes this is the yearbook club, but it could also be your student council. Leave no doubt in their minds about whether or not you are trying to become king.


You can try to befriend the committee members, but this is not necessary. If it is too aggressive and sudden, it may also seem dishonest.
If you are unsure of what committees are involved, you should ask a member of the yearbook club or a teacher. Make sure to ask early, because there could be a deadline for applying.

, Homecoming is a football event, so making an appearance at games is necessary. If you are not on a sports team, make sure that the football team knows that you support them by meeting them after the game.


Befriending football players will not seem like a dishonest political move. Teams often vote together, and they are very protective of their friends.
If you are friends with someone on the team, you can even go as far as to bring the team sports or energy drinks before and after the game.

, Hand them out and say, “Hope you consider voting for me!”


It’s good to get a trinket that you can put your name on. Some craft stores sell do-it-yourself kits where you get blank buttons. You can fill these buttons with a simple message about your bid for Homecoming King.
You can also pass out fliers. Full page fliers are clumsy, and should only be put up around the school. However, small fliers are easy to keep. Print out four fliers to a page and cut them out. Hand them out with your trinkets. People may get rid of them, but all they have to see is your name.

, Be friendly, not pushy. Say, “I hope you consider voting for me”.


Most people do not take voting for Homecoming very seriously. Just asking them in person will put the idea in their heads, which may be enough to convince them when they cast their vote.
Ask a social studies teacher if you can make announcements in their classes. Frame it as a political experiment by making a speech. They might be more willing to accept it if you can somehow connect it to your lessons.

, Don’t demand a vote in exchange for your candy. When people ask you why you’re giving them candy, say, “I’d like to be Homecoming King, but I don’t expect people to vote for me for free!”


If your school doesn’t allow you to set up in the lunchroom, you can still walk from table to table with a bag of candy and chat with your classmates.
Bring stickers or pins with your name on them. Hand them out along with the candy. People don’t have to take them, but they most likely won’t give them back.

, Enlist your friends to post about you. Photos always get more likes, so have someone take a photo of you. Ask them to post it with a caption about how they’re voting for you.


Pictures with animals are always very popular. If you don’t have a pet of your own, ask to take a picture with a friend’s pet. You can also do something drastic, like going to a petting zoo for your photo op.
Use a photo where you are smiling, doing something fun, or something silly. A funny self-deprecating photo can be good.

, Talk about your “loyal subjects”, your love of country, and all the battles that your “kingdom” has won. This can be accompanied by a picture of you photoshopped into a crown and cape. You can submit this to your school paper, but you can also circulate it yourself.


The Onion is a good model for joke articles.Make fun of yourself so that you come across as self-deprecating and funny, rather than arrogant.
You can also ask the school paper if you can put out ads for yourself as well. Some school papers will allow you to pay for ad space or sponsor their articles.

, If you are involved with service work, take the opportunity to talk about volunteering. If you are not already involved in service work, don’t worry. You can start a new project, like volunteering at a food bank or nursing home. Your health teacher may have an idea of places you can volunteer.


Set up a table in the cafeteria in a central location, or a location that people pass through. Call them over and say, “Hi, can I talk to you about helping out the community?”
Talk about your service opportunities. Then finish by saying, “I hope you consider volunteering with me and voting for me for Homecoming King!”

, If you have a big social circle, don’t forget about other social groups. Don’t abandon your friends, but sit with new people in the lunchroom and during free periods once or twice a week. Make sure to talk to people you don’t usually talk to.


It is not necessary to mention your bid for Homecoming King. Listen to what other people have to say, and enjoy getting to know different kinds of people. You may even make new friends.

, Most schools have a week of school pride leading up to Homecoming. Make sure people know that you love your school by participating in as many of the events as possible.


If possible, take on responsibilities when organizing events.
Usually there is some element of dressing up on each day of pride week. Coordinate fun or funny outfits with friends and classmates.
Encourage as many people as possible to participate in pride week with you.

, Studies show that people who have central roles in communication between groups are considered more popular. Even if people seem less likable than others, they are considered more popular if they are vital to decision making processes. Try to choose activities that require you to communicate with people one-on-one. Organizing a barbeque or a party is a good way to talk to many people at once. If you are the one organizing it, lots of people will need to come to you for details.
Don’t be exclusionary. The point is to create a voting base that is as broad as possible.

Bring comfort items from home.,
Make sure there's a lights out time.,
Bring ear plugs.,

Don’t drink soda or other caffeinated beverages.,

Paint fingernails and give pedicures.,
Plan arts and crafts.,
Watch a movie towards the end of the night.,
Don't sleep with pets.,
Tell an adult any fears you have.,
Have a bedtime routine.,
Arrange sleeping bags in a starburst shape.,
Sleep in a different room.",How to Have a Good Night Sleep in a Slumber Party," Bring items from home like a favorite blanket, stuffed animal or pillow. Maybe you have a journal you like to write in. A flashlight may be a good thing to bring, if you're scared of the dark. These items will help you feel at home, while also helping you relax, when bedtime rolls around., Hopefully, the parent supervising the party sets a lights out time in advance. If everyone knows what bedtime to expect, it will reduce whining and rebellion later on. If you're over 10 years old, you can handle a later lights out time, like 12:00 a.m.Everyone will probably giggle and maybe try to tell ghost stories for 15-30 minutes, but after that you should all be snoozing.

, Practice sleeping with ear plugs before the slumber party, if you're not used to them. Pop your ear plugs in at the party, when you want to go to sleep, but your friends keep talking.

, Don’t expect to do a lot of bright and early activities. Even if everyone gets to sleep on time, the activities from the slumber party will need plenty of rest. Tell your parents to pick you up no earlier than 10:00 a.m., and 12:00 p.m. is even better.Sleep in as much as you can, have breakfast, get dressed and play outside, if it’s a nice day.
Watch cartoons, play with dolls or action figures in the morning.

, Of course eat cake, if the slumber party is for a birthday, but remember that sugar will keep you wound up. Eat plenty of snacks throughout the party to keep your belly full, but make sure they aren’t things like white bread, candy bars or french fries. Those things will give you a rush of energy and make it harder to sleep.Healthy snacks include:


Apples and peanut butter.
Pretzels.
Bugs on a log is celery filled with peanut butter and topped with raisins.
Miniature whole wheat pizzas. Choose toppings like sausage, spinach, mushrooms or peppers., Soda and caffeine are a big no-no at slumber parties. You will already be full of energy and happy you are spending the night with friends. Don’t create energy overload by drinking sugary drinks like soda. Drink water and juice instead.

, Burn energy off with a group activity like bowling, ice skating or go-kart racing earlier in the evening. A big, group outing will help wear everyone out, when they get home. If you're hosting the party, this will keep your friends from completely messing up your home all night.

, This is an easy activity to do towards the end of the evening that won't make everyone hyper. It's fun and won’t interfere with sleep, like a pillow fight or dancing would. Hopefully, everyone's eyes will be tired from concentrating on painting fingers and toes!

, Art and craft activities can be fairly quiet and will also require focus. You will feel proud afterwards and have something to bring home.


Make friendship bracelets out of thread and beads.
Make models of the solar system out of balloons and paper mache.
Make mini robots out of things like batteries, a small motor and wires., A great way to wind the party down is by watching a movie before bed. Your friends may be so tired by then that they nod off themselves. Try to avoid hilarious comedies, high action, or anything that would cause a lot of talking, giggling or screaming.

, Not only can pets get scared when a lot of people are around, but they can distract you from sleeping. Play with Fluffy throughout the evening, if they're around and like to play, but don’t try to sleep with any dogs or cats. More than likely, the family dog will get uncomfortable sleeping with people and will move around a lot.

, If you’re afraid of the dark, tell the parent looking over the party. That way, they can be sure to keep a nightlight or hallway light on for you. If you feel uncomfortable sleeping away from home, don't be too shy to tell an adult before it gets too late. More than likely, it will only take some comforting words to make you feel better about sleeping over.

, About 30-45 minutes before bedtime, take the time to change into pajamas, brush teeth and wash your face. A bedtime routine will signal to everyone’s brain that it’s time to sleep. It will also be comforting to stick to a routine you probably do at home.

, Place everyone’s head towards the center of the starburst and no one can bicker about who sleeps by whom. Everyone will be near each other, and it will help you feel safe and closer as a group.

, Even if there's a lights out time, the party may keep going long after that. If you're tired, pick your sleeping bag up and go into a spare room. Tell your friends you're feeling sleepy, but you want them to keep playing games or telling stories. Don't feel bad about going into a different room. Your friends will respect your independence and assertiveness.

,
Have fun and be nice.",How to Have a Pretty Committee Sleepover," Massie has sleepovers every Friday night. You can have them on any day you want. Parents want you to get a good night's sleep on school nights, so Friday and Saturday are good. Tell the guests the time to be at your house. Be super exclusive and only invite your clique. You wouldn't want to dish gossip and secrets with anyone else, right? Keep your limit on guests to 3 or 4. More than that could cause too much drama. Though the sleepover should be exclusive, a lot of people should know about it.;
, This could be your bedroom, entertainment room, or basement. Let the room feel like a getaway. Put vanilla scented candles in safe places around the room to set the mood. Parents might not want you to have candles, so if that sounds too dangerous, simply spray Vanilla scented room spray or perfume before the guests arrive. Don't overdo it though - you don't want the guests to choke! Lavender sheet spray is also provided for the sleeping bags at Massie's sleepovers. If you have enough money you can buy each guest a nail polish or something and put it on their sleeping bag. To give a five star feel, put chocolates or Andes mint chocolates on the pillows. Also, have the lights dimmed a little bit if you have a dimmer switch in your room. Bring your pet if she'll stay - don't force her! (that's obnoxious x10). Make sure none of your friends are allergic. Tell your family members to try to keep from coming in your room and interrupting your sleepover.

, This allows easy snacking, and more importantly, gossiping! Also, everyone is surrounded by friends and no one is on the edge.

, Put lit scented candles (if it's OK with your parents) in the bathroom, make sure the soap container is full, and keep fresh towels in the bathroom. Only put shampoo, conditioner, and body wash that you want the guests to use in the shower/tub. Avoid confusion by not making guests feel overloaded by tons of old, raunchy containers of shampoo. Also, give the bathroom a spritz of room spray to match the candles' scent. Make sure that you're close to the bathroom so it allows easy bathroom breaks and no rushing.

, Some examples are camping (like in book 5, ""The Pretty Committee Strikes Back,"" Massie has a camping themed sleepover complete with fresh pine scented room spray, a fake plastic campfire, glow-in-the-dark stars hanging from the ceiling, a CD player playing fake cricket noises, and dimmed lights). Plan some ideas for fun, such as: Would You Rather?, Wear or Dare, Truth or Dare, Twister, etc. Add any fun games that you can think of that match your sleepovers theme. Play popular music all night long (you can make a playlist before the sleepover). Keep recent magazines handy.

, Why not have a fashion show? If you want to spend some extra time with your clique, go shopping with them and try on different outfits for the fashion show. Or, have your clique bring clothes that they don't want, and spice them up for a fun craft. Walk on the ""runway"" and take plenty of pictures. Try bring clothes that are cute, but don't work on you. You and your friends can trade them.

, Later (either later that night or the next day), post those pictures in a special album on Facebook or another social network. Beware: LBRs may become jealous!

, Massie specifically said in ""Invasion of the Boy Snatchers"" that DVDs are off limits at her sleepovers. You can watch movies on nights when you are alone.

, Put all of the best snacks on a large table in the main room. Have a snack bowl for each guest full of their favorites. Usually, Massie serves sparkling cider. Always have a second drink choice (like soda) for picky guests. Make sure you have healthy snacks AND junk food. Everyone needs sugar to stay up, and healthy snacks to stay fit. Make sure the food is fine for everyone to eat (No meat if you have a vegetarian friend; No animal products if you have a vegan friend; Low sugar if you have a diabetic friend; nothing any of your friends are allergic to)

, You will seem boring and just not fun! Try to stay awake at least until one person has drifted off. That way you won't miss out on any gossip or pranks! Have a drink with caffeine ready!

, Smoothies are quick, easy, and healthy, so use that as a drink, perhaps. You can make most of these before the sleepover - just leave them in the fridge overnight.

,, The PC is cruel, but you shouldn't be.

, Walk down a pretend catwalk to music. Don't forget to smile for the camera.

, Draw a shape, such as a star, on a piece of fleece and trace around it, leaving a border. Cut it out. Repeat until you have 4 different sizes.

, Cut a slit near the top and string a ribbon through. Tie it to your zipper and trim the ends.

, Tightly tie ribbons into tiny bows around a stretchy headband. Trim the ends of the ribbons.

, Trace each flip-flop onto fleece. Cut out the shapes, and cut a slit where the thong needs to fit. Glue the fleece to the flip-flop. Glue a craft boa to the thong. Let dry.

, Girls stand in a line with their eyes covered. No one opens her eyes until she has been tapped on the shoulder. The girl at one end starts by opening her eyes, tapping the girl next to her, showing her a dance move, and then covering her eyes. The second girl taps the third girl, shows her the dance move, adds her own dance move, and covers her eyes again. Keep passing the dance on until everyone has added a move. The last girl says, ""Eyes open!"" and shows everyone the entire dance routine.

, Each girl turns to the person on her right. In the middle of the circle is a pile of hair accessories-headbands, barrettes, and hair elastics. On ""Go!"" everyone must style the hair of the girl in front of her in only 5 minutes. You can't check the hairstyle from the front to see how it looks--just try to make the silliest hairstyle you can! Be careful not to pull or tangle anyone's hair.

, Pass the book around to your friends. At the end, read everyone's answers aloud.

, This game is fun to play when you're lying your sleeping bags. Start the game by passing a stuffed animal back and forth to each girl. Every time you get the stuffed animal, you have to add one word to the story. See how long-and silly-your bedtime story gets. No sleeping until the story is over!

Try to make it a number that's big enough for group activities but small enough to be manageable and still fun.


If you're not sure how many to invite, plan your night and then pick a number. Sometimes it will determine itself -- how many people you can fit in the car, an even number for teams, or the amount of chairs you have in your basement.;
, Go out to eat to your favorite restaurant, stay in and order pizza, ask your parents to cook dinner for you or cook it yourselves! Basically, feed your hungry friends and have fun messing around with them, not worrying about school or drama. Good food can make a good start to a great party.


It's a great idea to keep your friends busy -- everyone can build their own personal pizza with crazy toppings, decorate a cake, or build their own sandwiches or sundaes. Or just make mom and dad take care of it! Once everyone is fed, you can plan the rest of your party.

, Comedies are great with your friends! And then afterward, have everyone spend the night, staying up as late as possible. Who can make it to sunrise? Sure, there's already No Sleep Thursday, but it can be any day of the week. Movie marathon, perhaps?


If you're staying up late, make sure you have plenty of sugar to stay awake, lights to keep you awake, and things to keep you from getting bored and sleepy. You'll have a soda-can pyramid large enough for Facebook in no time. Mountain Dew fort, anyone?

, If they're girls (or boys who wear make-up...), of course! Invite some friends around to your house, have them bring their make-up and get going on making each other beautiful. Who cares if you look silly? You'll still have fun giggling at the photos! While you're making each other over, have a good chat about school, other friends, boys, movies, music, celebrities - anything!


You could also make this super ridiculous, too. Bright blue eyeshadow, red lips -- the kind of stuff you see in those terrible glamour shots. Then take pictures and have a sort of fashion show, pretending to be haute couture models. Do each other's make up with crazy colors, glitters, and hues.

, Save your money during the weeks before your party (and ask your friends to do the same) and get to shopping. Have fun trying on new outfits, even if you can't afford them! Heck, walk into stores you would never walk into and try on things you would never wear. But don't let the salesperson know!


If not the mall, what kind of shop could you just go crazy at? It's your day! Do you go nuts in bookstores? Would you love to spend hours trying on jewelry? Painting pottery? Outlet stores? Thrift shopping?

, You probably live pretty close to the pool or to the beach -- provided it's not winter, of course. If it's doable, make an entire day of it. Have each friend bring some snacks, their towel, and spend the day playing pool games and soaking up the sun. When everyone's tired of swimming, you can play backyard or beach games and have a barbecue or a bonfire.


Make sure your friends are cool with this! Some people either don't like it, can't swim, or are uncomfortable being in swimming suits. Run it by your friends first if this is how you'd like to celebrate your birthday.

, You can make your own karaoke joint in your basement! Buy or rent a machine (or find a friend that has one) and become a pop star for one night. When everyone's vocal chords are tired, start getting some competitive gaming on.


Make sure your parents are cool giving you control of part of the house! Let them know your plans so they don't worry and, more importantly, don't walk in every 5 minutes to check what's going on.

, They're not just for babies -- games can get any party going, can break the ice, and get everyone laughing. But you probably don't want those old games you've been playing for years. Here are some new ideas!


Go for a scavenger hunt. Have your parents (or any outside source) hide things around the house/neighborhood. Two teams could look for different clues and it could be a race to see who gets the last clue first.
Go for a photo scavenger hunt. Two teams each have a camera and take five or six photos in a given amount of time. They then exchange cameras and the other team has to recreate the photos in the exact same position in the exact same place. If you can travel around town, find a place they might not recognize!
Play balloon dare. Write dares on little pieces of paper, insert them into balloons, and blow them up. Then people have to go around choosing balloons and popping them, one at a time, completing the dare inside. But don't be too mean -- make the dares doable and only a little nerve-wracking!

, Invite 5-12 friends and all go down to the park for a day. Take a massive picnic, nail polishes, towels to sunbathe on and lots of sunglasses. Take a few footballs or other balls to kick around too.


If there's an outdoor pool near you, you could do the same idea there, chill out on the grass near the pool and take a dip if you get hot.
After you could all go home and have dinner, eat cake and then have a few of your friends stay for a sleepover.

, Because whether you're 3, 13, or 103, cake is part of any good birthday. When all is said and done (you might not want to have everyone in cake comas before you go laser tagging), bust out the cake and ring in your new year. Cakes and cupcakes are becoming so trendy, you could probably get one in any flavor you can imagine.


If you're having a party, you might want to provide a few other things for your guests, too. Drinks (water, soda), cake (possibly different flavors or an alternative for those who don't like it or are allergic), and snacks will keep your guests from leaving for the nearest Mickey D's.

, Split the party into two groups and see who will win the game -- what should the winners get? Everyone can bowl -- and those who aren't good at it usually can have fun laughing at themselves. See if there's a late night party night going on for the weekend of your birthday. Sometimes it's cheaper, too!


Bowling alleys usually have pool tables, dart boards, and an arcade, too! Not to mention the awesome, greasy bowling alley food. So when you're tired of repeatedly throwing a ball at 10 little pins, there will be more to do a hop, skip, and a jump away.

, Just like bowling, it's something everyone can do. And who doesn't like shooting people? If you have enough people for teams (and an even number), why not? Your birthday will get everyone's blood pumping for sure.


Being active is always good -- especially if it's a little out of the ordinary. Try going to a skateboarding park, playing frisbee golf, volleyball, going for a hike, or boating. Do something you don't normally do!

, Either save up your money for a professional treatment during the weeks before your party, ask your parents to pay for it as your birthday present or use your own beauty products and make over each other at your house! There are plenty of treatments to choose from and you'll feel great afterwards!


Even if you can't afford a trip to the spa, don't let that stop you! You and your friends can give each other mani-pedis, do facials (grab the cucumber slices!) and start a massage line! You get first position, of course.

, Just camping in your backyard works best at a party, just in case anyone wants to go inside the house during the night. You can sit around the fire, playing games, eating and drinking, telling stories, playing guitar, and enjoying the night sky, flickering flames, and good company. Remember the marshmallows!


The main thing that ruins a good bonfire is running out of wood and kindle. Make sure you have enough matches/lighter fluid and newspaper/wood/things to burn to keep the night going. And enough hot dogs, s'mores supplies, and soda!

, Sometimes staying at home, going to the movies, or to the cinema just isn't special enough. Take the day to a theme park! Just make sure all your friends have the entire day free, have some pocket change for food, and like roller coasters!


If the nearest theme park is a bit far away, ask your parents if you and a few friends can stay the night at a nearby hotel and make the weekend of it. You can pack sandwiches, an overnight bag, and get all the free coffee and shampoo you want! Now that's a birthday.

, Instead of the basic ""go to the movies,"" or ""go to a restaurant,"" do something you almost never do. Go horse back riding (as long as you and your friends can horse ride!). Go to a comedy show or live theatre. Paint mugs. Go to the aquarium. Dress up in prom wear. Why do what you do every weekend?


Anything normal can be made not normal with just a tweak or two. Go to your favorite restaurant, but dress up like you're going to hit the clubs. Hit the theme park with a list of 100 different things to do and go crazy getting it done. Turn making dinner into a cooking show. It's all in your imagination!

, One short trip to Pinterest will give you hundreds and hundreds of ideas. You don't need to do your classic ""white trash bash"" or ""90s"" party. It's 2017 and it's time to get creative. Have a glow party. Thrift store prom. Sandwich party. What have none of your friends ever done?


Talk to your parents about what's doable and what's not. Having a money party might be difficult, you know? So throw them a list of ideas and find out what you both think would be doable and fun.

, Whether it's spring, summer, winter, or fall, there's probably something going on where you and your friends could go cheer, eat popcorn, and get rowdy. Does your area have a league for baseball, hockey, soccer, football or basketball? Local leagues generally have cheap tickets and the games can be a lot of fun and totally energizing.


Make it extra fun by bringing soda, snacks, blankets, and chairs. It's like a picnic that comes with its own entertainment! Bring some travel games, too, in case the game has long breaks and you and your friends need to kill time.

, If you're celebrating on the weekend, there's probably something nearby that could be fun -- even if you're not sure! Take the chance on a band you've never seen or a show you've never heard of. Look up what's happening in your area and buy tickets as soon as possible. Make a night of it!


Sometimes concerts go late and can be expensive. Be sure to clear everything by your friends first before you make plans. They may be thinking pizza and video games when you have a lot of crazy ideas planned. But maybe you can change their minds, too!

,

Write thank-you cards.",How to Have a Great Sleepover Birthday Party," Make the invitations in such a way that it reflects your personality.


You can use Microsoft Word to make them, or write them by hand. It doesn't really matter, as long as the guests know all the information.
On the invitations, include who the party is for, what day it is, what time it starts and ends, where your house is, and your phone number (RSVP). Write the RSVP deadline date, and tell the guests what to bring (sleeping bag, clothes, pillow, etc.). Put the invitations in envelopes and mail them (or hand them out at school).;
, At most sleepovers, the host makes gift bags for the guests.


Get a bag for each guest, and write their name on it (decorate if desired). Inside the gift bags, put in candy, mini notebooks, gel pens, nail polish, and/or anything else you think your friends would like.
Lay all the bags out on a table before the party (but don't give the bags to them until it is over.) Or, you can hide the gift bags at the end of the party and turn it into a scavenger hunt.

, Hang balloons and streamers if you have them, and also put up happy birthday signs.If you don't have any just make some of your own.


Add glitter for some sparkle.
Make room for all the sleeping bags.

, It's best if this is in the usual eating areas; crumbs in the bedroom aren't much fun and risk staining your floor, clothes and the sleeping bags. However, candies in a bowl are usually fairly safe to have in your room.

Use a tablecloth or decorate one with some roll of paper you can get at your local craft store.

, Soon they will arrive. When they do, take their things and put them in your room (or wherever you will sleep). Put their presents on a table or the floor.

, It doesn't have to be a huge game, you can just have fun tossing the balloons around at the beginning of the party. You can watch TV while waiting for your guests, or just have snacks and talk. You could go with karaoke, a fashion show, or a dance party. Stick with activities everyone likes and can get excited about!


Some more party games are limbo and freeze dance. For limbo, any long pole or stick will do.

, Usually it will be pizza, but it can be something else. If you are ordering pizza, get some plain, some pepperoni, and whatever your friends like. Have drinks ready, like water, juice and soda. (Don't get too full for dessert!).

, Remember to add candles to the cake and sing ""Happy Birthday.""

, It's good to have someone write down what you get, so you can write thank-you cards later. Say thanks anyway to who got you the gift, even if you don't love it, it's still nice. Read cards, if any. Sometimes, people write personal cards, so ask before you read it out loud.

, This is a classic sleepover game that almost everybody loves. Just make sure the dares aren't too crazy, and the truths nothing too personal (but asking about secrets is the fun of the game).

, You can also paint each other's nails. Get a lot of colors, and take turns doing your friend's nails. You can also do this with other makeup if you want.

, To make sure that all guests are okay with the movie you watch, have three or four ready and take a vote on what they want to watch (you vote too.) If it's a tie, just pick one. And besides, who said you can only watch one movie?

, You don't have to go to sleep just yet, but it's great to be comfy. Also let your friends change into their PJ's (if someone forgot PJ's, have extras ready). You can keep watching the movie if you want.

, Ask about their crushes and things (if you didn't already in Truth or Dare). Just remember, if they ask you about a secret, you don't have to tell them if it's that personal. Or, change the subject. Luckily, there's many of them. Talk about sports, vacations, school, boys, etc.

, As much as you want to, it's not healthy to stay up the whole night. You should probably go to sleep at midnight or one o'clock, because if you wake up at nine, you'll get a great amount of sleep. If someone falls asleep early, don't wake them up! If you wake up early, don't wake your parents unless absolutely necessary. Let them rest.

, A parent can make waffles, bagels, pancakes, or whatever you want to eat. Or, you can make your own waffles or pancakes or eat out (you could do this for dinner, too).

, You can play outside, too, if it's nice out. Play tag or something outside.

,, Thank them for coming, and don't forget the gift bags!

, This is optional, but it's polite to do it.

Think of a theme first before you send invitations out.,
Make a guest list.,
Send out the invitations.,
Decide what food, snacks and drinks you'll have at the sleepover.,
Decorate the party areas.,
Show everyone where to put things on arrival.,
Start with just some fun stuff for the daytime.,
As the sun begins to set, go back in and head to the den, your bedroom, or wherever you choose.,
Dance a bit.,
Make a cool, funny videos and dance or something.,
Have a pillow fight.,
Have a spa treatment.,
Play Truth or Dare, Would You Rather, or similar games.,
Watch movies and eat plenty of healthy popcorn.,
Take lots of friendship photos with your friends.,
Prank call friends you know won't mind.,
Make a scrapbook full of memories from that sleepover.",How to Have a Girly Sleepover," That way, you can start the ball rolling with the invitation, and if you need guests to bring things for the theme, this can be included in the invitation. For example, if you do a girly award show theme make little awards and try to find a red carpet. Or, tell all of your guests to come in their girliest fanciest clothes.;
, Even if you only have one guest coming you can still have some fun following these steps. It's a good idea to keep the group small, anything above six girls will become a bit rowdy and difficult for you to ensure everyone is having a good time. Plus, consider where everyone will fit for sleeping.

, Don't pass them out at school, people will get jealous. Send them through the mail.


If that isn't possible, do it when people won't notice too much. Make sure you list anything they will have to bring, like sleeping bags, pillows, CDs, etc.







, Are you going to buy the food or make it yourself? Work this out well in advance. You could even consider making or baking food as one of the fun activities you do together.

Snacks aren't just for eating at movies, some will help you all to stay up late too. Have chips, sodas and sugary treats to help you not fall asleep. Soda has caffeine, candy has the sugar. But be warned! While eating candy is fun, and will help, your sugar could crash, which means that you will get really tired, and basically fall asleep.

, A couple of hours before the guests arrive, decorate to get the theme in place. Put pillows everywhere, bring out light healthy snack food. If you want, light some nice smelling candles, especially for the spa part.

, Tell them where to put their clothes and such. If they are new to your house, show them around. Set some ground rules and stick to them. Say if your mom doesn't want you all to go into her office, don't!

, Play a sport, or if you live near a beach or have a pool, go swimming! Leave the juicy gossiping and games for nighttime.

, Let the gossiping begin! Boys make a good topic to start with.

, After you stop squealing from the cute boy gossip, get some CD's and dance! Make up a dance routine and practice it with them and teach them how the dance routine goes.


Throw a dance party. Get a disco ball. If you don't have one, search disco lights on your computer and turn off the lights and get some music to go with it and dance.

, When you're happy with it, post it on YouTube.

, Grab a pillow and blanket for shield and hit each other as hard as you can.

, Make little ""stations"" for the girls to cycle through. If one girl is awesome at manicure/pedicures, make her the manicure/pedicure person. If another girl is really great at make-up, make her the make-over person, then switch. You'll all look (and feel) extremely glamorous!


Give each other makeovers and new hair do's. Put on a mud mask or make your own. Put cucumbers on your eyes, lay down, and chat for a while.






Look after everyone's skin. Make sure every trace of makeup is off before you all settle down to sleep. Going to sleep with makeup isn't good for your skin.
Hold a contest to decide who can do the best makeup.

, Just have fun with it! For a fun game of Truth or Dare, give each girl a piece of paper and have her write down as many truths and dares she can think of. Put all the truths in one box or hat, and dares in another. Then have the person up pick one out of the desired container. Some other games to try include:


Sardines: This is like hide and seek, but in the dark. One person hides, and the rest of the people count. When you're done counting, go look but when you find her, don't say a word. Hide with her and it will eventually even down to the last person!
Sleeping Beauty: Don't worry, there is no kissing involved. Basically, one person lies down on the floor with her eyes closed, and everyone else has to make her laugh. When she laughs, the person who made her laugh takes her place.

, Watch a movie, funny video whatever anything that is on the TV or computer.

, You want this to be a night that is never forgotten because it's so awesome and amazing! Also take photo selfies. Even if you are not a picture person, make random faces and take pictures. Maybe even take pictures and post them on a website.

, Don't do anything too scary though, like the whole breathe really heavy and say ""I'm gonna kill you"" thing or something like that. Make it funny!


If your friends won't get mad, and will think it is funny, prank them. Before your party you can tell one or two friends about the prank, and when the time comes, do the prank! Make sure that the person or people you are pranking won't get mad and leave your sleepover. You want this to be a fun sleepover. If you only invited one person, make sure she won't get mad, and prank her! In the end of your pranks, it should be giggles and saying, ""remember when we did this"". instead of crying and calling parents to pick the guest up. It should be a fun night!







, Make up nicknames for your boy crushes and write them down in a journal, take silly pictures and other things.

Pick the right makeup.",How to Be Fashionable at a Pool Party," A large bag is essential for any pool party, as it will hold everything that you might need. Fortunately, your bag doesn’t have to match a theme or even your outfit. Aim for any cute patterns or colors that you like. Just make sure the bag is big enough to hold everything you need – don’t make it too big though.Try getting a beach bag that has hidden pockets, that way you can hide any personal items, such as sanitary napkins, or valuables, such as your phone.
The material isn’t important, although you should consider that your bag may get wet. If you have a leather or suede bag, this might damage the material. Choose what makes you feel great.;
, Just because this is a pool party doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t wear jewelry. Part of being fashionable is wearing the perfect jewelry for the occasion. You want to accessorize, not decorate, so practice moderation.Consider simple earrings and a thin, chain necklace.
Or, go bold and wear a chunky necklace or even a long, beaded necklace with accompanying earrings.
You can also stack bracelets for a cute look.
Don’t wear your best pieces to a pool party, as you run the risk of losing them or getting them wet.
If you’re going to swim, consider putting your jewelry in the secret pocket of your large bag while you’re in the water.

, A simple and always-appropriate accessory for any pool party is a hot pair of sunglasses. You need to protect your eyes from UV rays, and sunglasses scream fashionable. Try to wear some designer sunglasses if you have the money. If not, there are some cheaper imitations of the real deal at most box stores. Get a pair that you feel compliment your face shape.A sun hat is another great way to protect your eyes and will also keep the sun off of your face.

, Sandals or flip flops are the most fashionable and practical choices for any pool party. You don’t want to wear expensive footwear to a pool party, as they will surely get wet. Instead, choose less expensive, comfortable shoes that complement your outfit.Big, box stores and even discount shoe retailers are a great source of cute summer shoes.

, Your beach towel should be fun or brightly colored, and most importantly, it should be big. Your colorful towel will not only attract attention, but it will be big enough for others to sit on while they talk with you. Big, fun towels are inviting, attention getting, and perfect for drying off and soaking up the sun., Whether you plan to swim or not, you will likely wear some type of swimwear. Put on a bikini or swimsuit that looks good on you. There are several fashionable, flattering, cute options for both types of swimsuits. If you can't decide, consider a tankini, since it's a combination of the two.If this is a work-related pool party, a bikini is likely inappropriate.If you don’t find a swimsuit that you love in stores, remember that there are thousands of styles available on the internet.
Choose your trunks, guys. You don’t want to wear swimwear that is too long and baggy. On the other hand, you don’t want to wear a tight, bikini suit. The most fashionable and flattering look is a more fitted trunk that rests above the knee., A dress makes for a great pool party outfit. They are lightweight, breathable, one piece, and, of course, fashionable. The dress you choose should be colorful or have a fun pattern. It should also be made of lightweight fabric.


If you’re plus sized, consider wearing a dress with a smaller pattern and in a cute hi-lo cut, which accentuates all of your beautiful curves., Choosing what clothes to wear to the party can be tricky. If you opt for an outfit, make sure that you wear layers so that you can remove or add them as necessary so that you don’t overheat. You may decide that you’d prefer to wear shorts or capris. Choose a lightweight top or tank top to go with your underwear, such as a tank top and denim shorts or capris. , You’re at the party and you’ve taken off your outfit, but you’re also not swimming and you want to wear a little something. You might decide that you don’t want to walk around in your swimsuit, but you also don’t want to be fully dressed. A sarong or cover-up is the perfect, fashionable solution. Choose a sarong or cover-up that complements your swimsuit and jewelry, which will allow you to walk around confidently and fashionably., Enjoy yourself at the pool party, but remember to take special care of your skin. Bring your sunscreen with you and reapply as necessary. Remember, sunscreen doesn’t prevent you from tanning, it just shields you from harmful, cancer-causing UV rays.If you’re planning to swim, make sure that your sunscreen is waterproof
You need to reapply your sunscreen at least every two hours.
Make sure that your sunscreen isn’t expired.

, You’ll be in the sun, and possibly the water, all day and you want your hair to look great all day (and night). Braids, buns, and ponytails are the perfect look for any pool party, are low maintenance, are easy to fix throughout the day, and will give your hair added waves when you take it down.You might also go for the windblown look, which should last all day if you put just a bit of mousse in your hair while it’s wet.Get summery beach hair by encouraging natural waves. Take a shower, put in some hair gel or hair spray, and scrunch your hair.

, If you choose to wear makeup, it needs to be as subtle and natural looking as possible. Only use waterproof makeup, and use it sparingly. The best makeup that you can wear for fashion at a pool party is a good, waterproof mascara. This will open up your eyes and subtly draw attention to them.There's also other waterproof makeup, like eyeshadow, eyeliner, brow gel, and concealer.

, You can buy food in or you could make your own. Or, you could even turn making sweets, cookies, cupcakes, candy, etc., into one of the sleepover's fun activities.


Don't forget to plan dinner. Either make dinner or order it in. Easy dinner foods for a sleepover include pizza, fish and chips, burgers, or pasta.

, This can have snacks and help-yourself drinks on it at all times, and have the dinner food on it when the time is right.

, Clear enough space to allow all of the guests to spread out their pillows, sleeping bags and blankets. If your room is too small, choose a room in the house that is large enough and won't disturb other family members.

, Although this isn't essential, it adds a nice touch, especially if the sleepover is for a special occasion such as a birthday, achievement or graduation. Blow up balloons and hang up party lights.

, Get some movies or just rent one from an online or cable source.


If you're planning on having a movie marathon, ensure that the movies are of a theme that all the guests will enjoy.

, For some sleepovers, this is the entire reason of having the sleepover. Choose games that the guests will like and can access. You'll probably need multiple monitors or screens, multiple controls, games with split screen ability and perhaps separate game areas that guests can wander around at different stages. If you don't have the extra monitors, controllers and games, ask guests to bring a few extra with them.

, For instance, when the guests arrive, turn on some music to rock out to. Or, play music for a while to dance to, perhaps in the early evening.

, You could paint each other's faces, do makeovers on each other or do movie transformation effects.


Maybe have a spa night if you're so inclined.

, This is simple to set up and easy to do. Have some extra pillows just in case there are some guests who don't want to use their own pillows.

, Hold a karaoke competition between each other. See who can sing the best––and the worst.

,, Look up fun pranks online and play them on one another. However, don't be mean spirited and deliberately set someone up because you're trying to be nasty to them; if you don't like a person, don't invite them.

, Add captions and funny designs to the photos to make them even funnier. Post them to your social media account to share with friends.


If posting online, keep them clean and considerate.

, If you have subscriptions that everyone else enjoys, watch a few of the videos.

Wear what you feel comfortable in to swim.,
Keep makeup simple.,
Go for a messy look with hair.,
Wear something besides a bathing suit.",How to Be Cool at a Pool Party1," If you don't feel comfortable in what you're wearing, that will show. Pick something in a color and style you love, and your confidence will shine through. Maybe you love an awesome tankini and shorts, or maybe you like to rock a one piece. Maybe you like short shorts or maybe you prefer board-length shorts. Just pick whatever makes you happy.Try a bright color to really stand out, such as turquoise or hot pink.
Patterns can also add pizazz to your outfit. You could try polka dots, stripes, or even a funky plaid suit.
You could also go classic and simple with a one-piece black suit.;
, If you want to wear makeup to the pool, keep it simple. Most of it is probably going to wash off anyway, so you might as well go light. Skip the foundation altogether, if you use it, and just go with a primer. Any makeup you wear should obviously be waterproof so it doesn't run all over your face. Try a waterproof mascara and a waterproof lipstick in a light color., Once again, if you're getting in the pool, you don't want a super fancy hairdo. You can go for a messy, wavy look by spraying in a texturizer that adds waves. You can also twist your bangs up and then pin them back out of your face. Throw your hair up in a ponytail if that's more your style. If your hair is super short, just go for a wild, natural look, as it will soon be getting wet., When you arrive and leave, it's best to have something besides just your bathing suit on. Plus, there are likely to be games and food, and you'll want to have some clothes on for that. However, you can keep it simple. Throw on a t-shirt over your swim shorts or a coverup dress over your bathing suit, and you're good to go. Add a pair of cool sandals and shades to complete the look."

Arrive and leave for ultimate coolness.,
Be confident.,
Be yourself.,
Have fun.,
Meet new people.,
Take a break if you need to.",How to Be Cool at a Pool Party2," While getting to class early will win you points with the teacher, being the first person to a pool party probably won't earn you any cool points. Try arriving just at the party's start time or a few minutes afterwards. Similarly, if you're the last person to leave, you might be perceived as not knowing when it's time to go (uncool), so try leaving when you notice that the party is starting to thin out., Nothing is quite as cool as confidence. Confidence just means you believe in yourself and what you can do. At a party, confidence might look like approaching new people, trying a new cannonball, or joining in with the games instead of hanging back on the sidelines.If you're feeling a bit shy or unsteady, just remind yourself how cool you are. You could say (in your head), ""I'm an awesome singer, and people want to be my friend because I'm funny.""

, Being yourself may, at times, seem contradictory to being confident if you're naturally shy. However, it's more an extension of being confident. Cool people are secure in who they are, and they have no problem letting other people see that. Don't be afraid to just be yourself.For instance, if someone cracks a joke you find funny, giggle to your heart's content. Don't be so shy that you hold back.

, Cool people don't let anything get in the way of having some fun. Get up and dance to the music, or start a cannonball contest. Invite people to have a limbo contest. Just have a good time, and invite others to do the same.Keep in mind, your fun shouldn't come at anyone else's expense. Don't make fun of people, or create a huge mess or inconvenience.

, Don't just hang out with your same-old group of friends. Try mingling to meet some new people. If you're a bit shy, take a friend along with you while you mingle. That way, you'll have someone comfortable by your side, but you'll also be meeting new people.As you wander around the party, look for places you can introduce yourself to new people. When you see an opening, walk up and say, ""Hi, I'm Jess. I don't think I've met you before.""
Strike up a conversation. You can start with something about the party, such as ""It's a great day for a party, don't you think?"" or ""I really like the decorations. What do you think?""

, Not everyone is okay being around other people for hours at a time. If you feel like you're getting overwhelmed, look for somewhere to take a quiet break. If you're at someone's house, you can ask if there's somewhere you can sit for a minute. You could say you just want to get out of the sun for a minute.It's much cooler to take a break than to start getting irritated in the middle of a party because you're tired of people.

Bring a gift.,
Grab a bag for the basics.,
Slather on the sunscreen.",How to Be Cool at a Pool Party3," If it's a birthday party, of course it's nice to bring a gift for the birthday person. It doesn't need to be expensive. However, it should be thoughtful, meaning you think about what the person likes and find something they would like. Even if it's not a birthday party, it's nice to bring a gift for the host to say ""Thank you!"" You'll look cool if you make the host happy. For instance, you could bring a bouquet of flowers or cool gadget.It's also a good idea to thank the host both when you arrive and when you leave. A simple, ""Thank you so much for inviting me!"" is all you need.

, You'll probably need a bag for things like a towel, your keys, and your mobile phone. You might also want a change of clothes, and you'll definitely want your sunscreen. A hat might be a good idea, too, just in case you get tired of the sun.

, Burned skin and the possibility of sun cancer are decidedly not cool. If you think wearing sunscreen is ""uncool,"" consider applying it before the party. You can also take a bathroom to reapply it partway through. Use a sunscreen of 30 SPF or higher with broad spectrum protection."
"
Dress up in a costume or extravagant ""going-outfit."",
Have a few casual drinks before leaving.,
Have something to eat an hour before the party.,
Arrive late.,
Make plans for the end of the party before you start partying.",How to Be a Party Animal1," Party animals announce their presence the minute the enter the room, and there is no better way to do this than a costume, prop, or killer outfit. Obviously, the outfit will change depending on the party, but the important thing to remember is that you want to wear it with confidence. A party animal wears something because they want to, not because they're worried about what other people think.


For themed parties, you want to commit as completely to the theme as possible. Go big or go home.
If it is a casual party, throw on a silly hat, shirt, or grab a weird prop to bring with you. Anything that calls attention to you will do.;
, You don't want to be drunk when you arrive, but you also don't want to feel like you need to ""catch-up"" when you get there. If you're going to drink, ensure that you have a driver before leaving.

, Unless you're going to a dinner party (where party animals are generally less welcome), chances are good you're not going to get a whole lot of food at the party. Eat a good meal before the party so that you energy and food in your stomach. Going into a party without eating beforehand isn't just a drag, it can be dangerous if there's drinking involved. Always have a good meal 1-2 hours before going so that you don't have to worry about feeling sick or foraging for food when you're in party animal mode.

, A party animal needs a habitat to party in. It will be difficult to get momentum going if you're the first one in the door, so play it cool and arrive fashionably late. If it is a smaller gathering or party, 15-20 minutes should be fine, but if you're going to a huge party you should try to arrive at least an hour after things have kicked off.


If you do arrive before things really kick off, never fear. Just have fun, be energetic, and the party will soon follow your vibe.

, No one wants to deal with rides home or places to sleep once they've transformed into a party animal. It is smartest and safest to deal with these things in advance. Make sure you have a designated driver if the party has alcohol, and check with the host that you have a place to sleep if you will not be driving home. Check in with your friends to make sure you have a buddy at the party to watch out for you if things go poorly -- the two of you can make sure that you both make it home safely.

"
"
Pull shy people into the party one at a time with friendly conversation.,
Pour out drinks slowly if the party has alcohol.,
Turn up the music.,
Play some games that get people moving, laughing, or sharing.,
Bring a pack of party animals with you.,
Know that a rocking party takes time to get started.",How to Be a Party Animal2," If you see someone by themselves or off in the corner, introduce yourself. Make them feel at home, then ask them to join you for a drink, a dance, or a game. The more people you pull into the party, the more rocking it becomes. You, the party animal, should be pulling as many other animals into your pack as possible. More importantly, the party animal needs to know everyone at the party, because everyone needs to know them.Listen to people as they talk and ask questions to get them comfortable speaking.
Introduce people as you find common interests., Forcing someone to do 5 shots in an hour is dangerous and can lead to a sloppy, sickening feeling. Instead, start drinking slowly, letting people get to their own comfortable level of drunkenness. A good party is one where everyone feels comfortable enough to let their inhibitions fly and have fun, not one where half the group is in the bathroom the whole time., Find songs that everyone can enjoy but have a quick beat and a lot of energy. As the party gets going, slowly turn up the volume to get people moving. While people should still be able to have a conversation, you also want people to feel free to stop talking and start dancing. Each group has different musical tastes, but there are some go-to party genres that get most people moving:


Motown
House/Dance/Rave
Beatles-era rock.
90's Hip-Hop., Games are one of the most sure-fire ways to get the crowd together and start having fun. A little competition, some humor, and common thread of conversation will help the party bond and bring up the energy of the group naturally. Just make sure that lots of people can play, being as inclusive as possible. While there are hundreds of games to start with, from drinking games to big, humorous group board games like Cards Against Humanity, you can't go wrong with some of the classics:


Truth or Dare
Never Have I Ever
Kings
Who am I?

, Show up with people who are just as fun and willing to be a bit silly. Having a good group around you makes the infectious energy easier to spread. However, this doesn't mean your ""wolfpack"" comes in and ruins the party for everyone else. If they are annoying or sloppy, then you may also be considered annoying or sloppy as well.


Mingle with other people, not just those in your group.
Check with the host beforehand if it is okay to bring guests.
Bring a party gift, like some food or extra drinks, if you show up with multiple people.

, Think of the energy of a party as a volume dial -- you want to raise it slowly, but surely, so that you don't blast anyone's ears or shock people who are still having a quiet, relaxed time. Don't expect your presence to suddenly kick the party into overdrive. Instead, be a little stealthy, slowly turning up the volume (both literally and figuratively), until the party is really bumping. Be a strategic party animal, and suddenly you'll have the whole pack following you."
"
Be yourself and stick to your guns.,
Remain in control of yourself.,
Loosen up and let go of your inhibitions.,
Lead the party from the front with group activities and games.,
Throw yourself completely into the party atmosphere.,
Have a sense of humor, but don't make a fool of yourself.",How to Be a Party Animal3," A party animal is not at the whims of every person who comes up and asks to do a shot or play a game. The party animal knows that he knows how to party and that he makes the party. Be confident. Even if you're just faking it, confidence attracts attention, so ""fake it 'til you make it."" Inject your own personality into the party by:


Rounding up groups for games that you want to play
Introducing yourself to new people
Dancing
Mixing up new ""cocktails.""

, Party animals are not sloppy or too drunk to function, they are in control and having fun at all times. Know your limits and accept them, otherwise you'll tip over from party animal to annoying nuisance in no time. Being a party animal is not about being the drunkest person at the party, or showing off how cool you are to others. It is about being a blast in every situation, helping others loosen up and fun and driving the party energy up.

, Let go of your fears, even if it takes a few drinks to get you to play air guitar on the dance floor, so accept that fact. A party animal isn't the one who stands quietly in the corner; he is the one dancing on the tables, making everyone have more fun. You are in control of how much fun you have at a party, so stop wishing things were more lively and make them lively.Being a party animal is not about thinking and planning, it is about acting. So go dance, ask that girl if you can buy her a drink, play a game, and get a little rowdy.

, Get the whole party on the same level, you party animal. You could be the first one to cut up the dance floor, DJ a ""party playlist,"" or lead a group sing-along to a favorite like ""Don't Stop Believing"" or ""Twist and Shout."" Whatever you do, try and get other people involved in your shenanigans.

, Own up to the theme, hit the dance floor with everything you've got, and stay involved with the games you play. You should be willing to step outside of your comfort zone, too, and let yourself live in the moment. As long as you stop from time to time to make sure you're not hurting or endangering anyone, a party animal knows how to spice things up and is willing to be a bit goofy to do it., You don't want to take yourself so seriously that you're not having a fun, but you also don't want to be an annoying, overly idiotic party-goer begging for attention. Remember the old expression and make sure people are laughing ""with you, not at you."" This should be easy if you just act like yourself and have fun, but never do something at a party just because you think it'll make you look cool -- it will almost always backfire."

This is the best way of ensuring a comfortable, fun night for everyone, as the tent is a small place and you must all be okay with close quarters. However, a tent sleepover can be an interesting, eventful night, so if you have 1 or 2 new friends, it's a good way of getting to know each other and talking!;
, You could do it in a campsite, but if everyone is round your house, more anxious people may feel safer knowing there are adults and a toilet near by. A bigger tent is better, as there is not only room to sleep, but room to move about and play games.

, Your guests don't want to be sleeping on a cold grassy floor. Make the tent look cosy and inviting, with mattresses, rolling mats, blanket, cushions and throws. If it's a birthday camping sleepover, you could put balloons in or around the tent. Make sure you have torches or a portable lamp so you have cosy lighting and you aren't stuck in the pitch black all night.

, Ask your guests to bring a bag of sweets/chocolate/candy with them, and you can provide the rest. Bring popcorn, fizzy drinks (with plastic cups), pizza, sweets and chocolate. It may be a good idea to bring a small rubbish bin and put it in the tent for all the leftover treats.

, Films are a great way of starting a night off, and usually don't last until the end. Try and choose a film that will get you all talking, like a scandalous rom-com or tear jerking drama. You could even watch some scary movies, if you're all brave enough!

, This game is a must for girly sleepovers. After the film, take one of your empty pop bottles and find a flat surface. All the girls sit in a circle around the bottle and one person spins it. Whoever the bottle top lands on is asked by the girls a question of Truth or Dare or Would You Rather. This is a great way to break the ice, have a laugh, and find out more about each other.

, Bring in nail varnish, hair ties, bobby pins and make up and give each other makeovers! This is a fun, girly thing to do, and gives everyone something to do. You could even to a ""Hairstyle Line"", where you all sit behind each other and give the person in front of you a beautiful or crazy hairstyle.

, Don't stay cooped up in the tent all night! You could play Flashlight Tag (use the light beam as a tag tap), Hide and Seek, or Wink Murder. If your parents let you, you could even have a campfire and toast marshmallows!

, You could make up your own or get some from the internet. Sit in a circle and take it in turns to read one with your best spooky voice. If everyone is feeling a little creeped out by the end, you could read some funny ones. Switch it up and have a play with it.

, Go crazy. Beforehand you could make a sleepover playlist. Boogie to all of your favourite tunes and dance around in your sleeping bags! (Just make sure you don't wake up your parents!)

, If it's at night, make sure your phone or camera has a flash. Take creative, funny, or silly photos together with props or costumes. In the morning, while your guests are eating breakfast, you could print out the best pictures and give them to your friends as a souvenir!

Live in an interesting or unique location.,
Have your own story.,
Make yourself accessible.,
Contact the appropriate stations.,
Be prepared if you do get approached.",How to Become a Star of Your Own Reality TV Show," Where you live can make a difference. Where you live has a lot to do with whether or not you are ‘reality show’ worthy. Right now, Alaskan reality shows are very common, and because of this, the people who live there have been made targets for reality TV stardom. Thus, you may have more chance if you live in Alaska or somewhere similar, depending on what's trending at the time. Not everyone can choose where they live, but if you can choose where to live, try to find a place that is common for reality shows.


Note that the location factor changes often, as different things become popular. Unique geographical locations (Hawaii, Alaska, the ‘wilderness’) are all very common places for reality show settings. Also, bigger cities like New York and Los Angeles are well known for their ‘filming scene’.
You don't have to have a 'rich' lifestyle to be famous in the reality TV world. Benefit Street was popular in the UK and New Zealand.;
, Everyone has a tale to tell! Have a fascinating background story. What makes your life interesting? Fur buyers in a very remote part of Alaska who live in an Inuit village and live a subsistence lifestyle (hunting, fishing, and gathering a lot of their food) are ideal reality TV stars, for example. If your life is anything like that, great, you have more chance of being a reality TV star than a school girl from Norwich, unless she drives dog sleds.


Live a life that very few people live, and, if it’s a life many people find interesting, television channels may believe it’s worthy of its own show.
Anything can be a good story. Get creative and think of something that makes your life truly unique. You could take a road trip across America with your best friends or live as a hermit (never leaving your apartment) in one of America’s most populated cities. There are literally endless possibilities for a reality show––all you need to do is think of one that’s truly going to ‘wow’ a viewing audience and make them want to tune in each week for every episode.

, It's all about who you know. Be accessible to people who want to hear your story. Basically, use the Internet to market yourself. By putting your story out there on the web, you are welcoming anyone to contact you:


Write blogs, make YouTube videos, run your own website.
Use social media and have connections to people.
Make the effort to have your contact information accessible. Have an email readily and easily found on all of your websites. If you have a business website, always have a phone number associated with it. This makes you an easy target for people scouting for reality shows because you can be easily contacted and any program makers will have a bit of a background regarding what you do.

, Pitching your own show to the appropriate station could work wonders. Many television stations welcome ideas being pitched to them, and will listen to different thoughts regarding a reality show. You may not always get a reply, but if you have a true ‘gem’, they will certainly make an effort to get in contact with you. Moreover, by approaching a station that fits the show you’re looking to market, you could set yourself up for a lot of success.

, Be flattered and a bit starstruck but keep your wits about you. Ask a lot of questions. The pay, although often mistaken for being quite high, is not typically a ‘get rich quick scheme’. In fact, the pay per episode is very low in the beginning of reality shows.

Avoid being afraid to introduce yourself to others.",How to Act at Your First Rave," Create a better understanding of how ravers are in life. They tend to be people who enjoy the nightlife without the clubbing, those with an interest in others, or whom wish to spend their time dancing and having fun;
, is. P.L.U.R. is the acronym for ""Peace, Love, Unity, Respect"". Many ravers follow this rule, as disobeying it usually leads to shunning until the behavior stops and people tend to stay away from you. If you follow P.L.U.R., you can usually get along with the crowd.

, When the word ""rave"" is said, most people think of drug abuse. This is not true. ""E"" or ecstasy, is used by some clubbers and dancers, however, those who don't do drugs & rave/dance for the fun of it do take it as an insult.

, Test it out and see how you like it. Are your friends into it? Do you like the music? Figuring out one of the reasons your interested beforehand can save you a lot of trouble in the interim.

, There is a wide variety of different styles of electronic dance music. Ask your friends for recommendations or search on YouTube to hear some of the worldwide trance/techno artists. Be prepared with it before going a rave; it's no fun for anyone if you don't like the music when you're at a rave.

, Finding a dance to do at a rave is always the hardest. The best way to learn is by example: look at those around you and follow what they are doing. Create your own style and be unique. Start off slowly and progress by going faster as you get used to it. It may take a while to learn a few cool dance moves associated with the rave scene before going, for example the Melbourne Shuffle.

, You're at a rave to have fun... not to show off your body, to get a person's number, or to flirt. Wear clothes that you feel comfortable in and what you can move freely without getting caught on things or other people. Once you get accustomed to space, it will be a little easier to make your wardrobe more eccentric.

, Some ravers like kandi. Kandi (also known as Kandii or Candi), is a hand crafted & beaded bracelet that many ravers adorn their wrists with. Trade some with others if you decide to make your own. Be cautious that loose kandi may fling off from your arm while dancing. Some ravers don't like kandi ravers because of the associated stereotype of immaturity. There are different groups of people in the rave scene that subscribe to different styles of raving, most of them defined by different styles of music, dance, or fashion.

, A lot of ravers love making friends; the ones who don't will make it obvious. Find a common interest with people and shower everyone with hugs.

Master the step-touch.,
Learn a basic groove.,
Don’t worry about your hands when you're dancing face-to-face, and just leave them by your side, straight or elbows bent.,
When in doubt, avoid the crazy dance moves.,
Relax.",How to Dance at Homecoming (for Guys)1," This is probably the most basic dance move of all. This is essentially where you step from side to side, while touching your feet together each time. Here’s how:


Step to the right. Then, move your left foot so it's right next to your right foot. Next, do the same thing to the left (step left, then move your right foot next to your left). Make sure to move each foot to the beat. Do this while “bouncing” to the beat — this is when your knees bend slightly to make you “bounce” up and down to the beat. There is a great tutorial in the Video section below.
This move is great, because it's very simple, but keeps you in motion. There are very few things that are more awkward than a guy standing still at a dance.;
, Now that you've got the step-touch down, take it up a notch. This is where you lean from side to side, and slightly shrug the shoulders, with a slight bounce.

, If your movements are too fast or flamboyant, you may seem frantic or nervous.

, If you're not quite confident about our funky dance moves, it's probably best to stick to the ones you know. No one will automatically expect you to bust out a b-boy windmill, so don’t worry.

, Few things are worse than a very tense dancer. Relax your muscles when dancing, and it will make a world of difference.


Humans are very good at picking up on body language cues. So, those around you may notice that you seem stiff and tense. Just relax and move to the beat.

"
"
Approach a girl that you want to dance with, and just say “Do you want to dance?” If she says yes, proceed to the next step.,
Put your arms around your partner’s waist.,
At this point, she’ll probably put her arms around your neck and move closer.,
Sway side and side to the beat, taking small steps to the left and right.",How to Dance at Homecoming (for Guys)2," If she says no, just ask another girl.

, Gently rest your hands against her sides, or on the small of her back.


Don’t grab her butt. In fact, general butt-touching should be avoided.

, Pull her in so that your bodies are touching, but not squished together. She should be able to rest her head on your shoulder or chest, but still be able to move somewhat. Remember: firm, not squished.

, This is all you need to do in terms of movement. Make sure you move exactly to the beat, or you may become off sync with her.

"
"
If you see a girl you want to dance with, approach her and ask her if she would like to dance.,

Avoid the wandering hands!",How to Dance at Homecoming (for Guys)3," If she says yes and faces her back to you, proceed to the next step. If she refuses, ask someone else.

, Again: firm, not squished.

, Avoid jerky, sudden movements-- try to be as smooth in your side-to-side movements as possible. Having your knees bent will help avoid that, but still be careful.


It can help to imagine making a infinity-symbol with your hips-- slight back and forth movements, but mostly smooth side to side motions.
Move at each beat, unless the music is too fast. Then, move every two beats.

Go to the party with a friend.,
Arrive at the party.,
Introduce yourself to someone you recognize.,
Interact with your group of friends.,
Exchange phone numbers with someone.",How to Act at a House Party1," The best way to ensure that you will feel comfortable is by attending the party with someone you know. This way, you can both watch each others' backs. It is better to arrive with a friend instead of meeting them at the party. If you plan to meet at the party, you might be stranded alone at the party for an hour or more.Be aware that if you bring an outgoing friend, they may want to be more social than you want to be. On the other hand, if you opt for someone who's less outgoing than you are, you may be tempted to hide out in a corner together and not socialize with other people.;
, Don’t be shy and knock on the door. Once you’re in the party, make sure to greet the host, if there is a clear host. Near the beginning of arriving at a house party, you should scan the rooms and see if you recognize anyone. Go through each room and scout the area for any friends or acquaintances you have.


Introduce yourself by saying, ""Hi, my name is Jill. How's it going?"" Just be yourself and people will respond positively.
If you are not close with someone, but you’ve chatted before, this is a good person to talk to. Try not to interrupt anyone who’s engaged in a conversation.
If none of your friends have arrived, try to play it cool by not seeming too desperate for conversation or attention. One way teens cope with this awkwardness is by smoking, but you should skip smoking. It's bad for your health, and you could start a bad habit that could last for years. Instead, check your cell phone for articles to read., Don’t feel embarrassed if you don’t know anyone at the party. Scan the party for somebody who doesn’t seem too preoccupied by a conversation. By finding someone who is free and seems to be in a similar situation, you have an opportunity to create a conversation. Once you create an interesting conversation, other partygoers might notice you.


Start simply by introducing yourself and tell this person how you recognize them. Then you can move into a discussion on the mutual topic that connects you.You can spice up the conversation by asking questions about their past. You can ask questions like: “Have you ever lived somewhere else?,” or “What did you do last weekend?”

, One of the easiest ways to socialize at a house party is to hang out with your friends. This is a good strategy because other partygoers will frequently enter your circle of friends. When other people come into your circle of friends, you can introduce yourself.


Follow your friend group, but don’t feel inclined to follow them throughout the entire night. A fun thing to do at house parties is to venture off alone.

, Sometimes it can be helpful to make it your goal to get somebody's phone number. Many people do this for dating purposes, but you can also make the same goal for gaining a friend. Once you meet somebody, keep asking questions until you both realize you enjoy each other's company.


Socializing doesn't come easily for everyone and that is fine. Making goals can sometimes improve your ability to socialize.
One way of getting somebody's phone number is by asking them if they'd like to hang out a different time. You could say, ""Hey, do you want to go to the Cubs game with me?""

Put your shoes, bag and coat where you're supposed to (ie.",How to Attend a Friend's Sleepover (Tween Girls)2," the door, your friend's room, etc.) and go into your friend's room. Unpack if you are told to/allowed. This is the part when you should show your friend the list of sleepover ideas.


If the other girls are there too, show them the list of ideas. They might even like them! Don't forget to show them your ideas.
Only unpack if you are told to or allowed. If you want to unpack, you can ask. Don't don't don't go in a huff or get angry if they say no.

Join in on the dance floor.The dance floor is a great outlet for having fun at a party.,
Have a drink.,
Start a game with someone.",How to Act at a House Party2," No one should ever feel too embarrassed to dance. If you are shy and feel uncomfortable, don't start the dance party. If partygoers are already dancing, join in, even if it is just for one song.


Dance floors are sometimes a good way to meet people. You can always compliment someone on their dance moves.
Let the music take over and don't fight the temptation. You will have an easier time dancing by feeling the rhythm and moving to the beat.

, If there is alcohol at the party, which there probably will be, don’t be shocked. Pour yourself a drink if the host offered it to you. Don’t make it a goal to get drunk, but having a drink or two could help you loosen up and chat with people. If you don’t want to drink, respect other people's decisions for drinking.


If you're underage, be sure to skip the drinking. It's easy for underage drinkers to drink too much, landing you in the hospital or worse. You could also get into serious legal trouble.
It is easy for people to over-drink at house parties due to social anxiety. Be aware of this phenomenon, and drink with caution and at a slow pace.
Drink plenty of water between consuming alcoholic beverages. Alcohol dehydrates the body, so you’ll need to keep your water levels high while drinking alcohol.
Don't drink with the goal of feeling social and outgoing. You could potentially become very intoxicated., Bring a deck of cards with you just in case some people want to play a card game. A popular card game at parties is poker or “Circle of Death.” There are other games you can play at parties like hide n’ seek, four corners, or a board game like Twister. House parties are all about letting loose and having fun.


Don’t feel embarrassed for trying to start a game. There will be at least one or two other people who think you have a good idea.

Get permission to attend the party.,
Get dressed for the party.,
Travel to the party safely.,
Clean up after yourself.,
Moderate your drinking and others.,
Leave when you want.",How to Act at a House Party3," If you still live with your parents or guardian, ask them if you can go to the party. If you have strict parents, you might need to stretch the truth in order to go to the party. However, it's not responsible to lie to them. You should always be open with them; if you are caught lying, you could be grounded. You should also get a confirmation from the party's host that you are welcome to come. If you know your parents won’t let you go, try one of these options:


Try to convince your parents to let you go to the party for a couple of hours.You could tell them things that would put their fears at ease, such as letting them know responsible adults will be there or that you will take a friend and promise to watch out for each other. You should also promise to not engage in any illegal activities, such as underage drinking.

, Make sure to wear what feels comfortable or something you feel confident in. Don’t be afraid to be yourself and dress the way you want. Most house parties are informal, but others have dress themes that might be fun to follow.


If you know people who are planning to get dressed up for the party, coordinate with them so that you all match. Matching with your friends at a party is a good way for people to notice and talk to you., You have to be careful when traveling to a house party. Many house parties are an excuse for teenagers or college kids to drink underage. If you are a driver, consider this before traveling to the party. There is no shame in taking a cab to the party or public transportation. Your parents will appreciate your responsibility if you choose to take a cab instead of drive to a party.

, Respect the house you are in by picking up after yourself. You could even pay it forward by throwing away other people’s trash. Remember that someone lives at this house and might live there with a family. Show your gratitude to the host and their house by cleaning up after yourself.


Your actions might even inspire others to clean up after themselves as well.

, Be aware of how much you drink at the party. You should be able to keep an accurate count of how many drinks you’ve consumed. While it is not your place to tell people when they can drink or not, you should keep an eye out for anyone in need. It is common for young, inexperienced drinkers to drink a toxic amount of alcohol. If you see somebody looks too drunk, try to assist them if appropriate.You could let the drunk person’s friends know this person is in need.
Careful not to overstep your boundaries when getting involved with extremely intoxicated people. Some people can handle themselves more than you’d think.
If you see any abuse or signs of date rape, talk to the owners of the house and take action. Get a group together to intervene. In the worst case scenario, you may need to threaten to call the police or actually make that call.

, Don’t feel pressured to stay at the party until the very end. You can leave whenever you want. Sometimes it is best to stop in to a party for an hour and leave. This works for some people and is infuriating for others. Do whatever feels best for you. Try not to leave a mess or damage anything. Respect the host and help clean up before you leave.

As Nadine Ismail says, no matter how a girl looks, if she's confident, she's cute.,
When you dance with a guy just think your dancing with your girl friends, then just take out dirty dancing and your date won't care how you dance.

,
Practice dancing every day a week before the dance, and use slow songs too, to practice dancing close and also fast songs to practice the way you really dance with your friends.

,
Have confidence!,
Get out there and be the one who dances while everyone just stands around.

,
Be calm and collected; you don't want to be too 'wacky' or too boring or it will throw people off!

",How to Dance at High School Dances," So about a week before your dance you need to get some confidence. Take a shower every day, and take time to put on nice smelling lotion, perfumed body powder, and wash your face using cleansers, toners, moisturizers, scrubs, and masks. Tell yourself you're pretty, even if you don't believe it because you are. If you don't think you're cute, how will the guy you like think you are?;
,,, The best thing a girl or boy can wear is confidence and a smile. It attracts people to you and you'll have more fun.

,,"
"
Make an effort to look your best.,
Go with friends.,
Scope out the scene.,
Listen to the music.,
Start by bobbing your head to the music.,
Take one step to the right and one step to the left.,
Keep your upper body relaxed.,
Let your body sway naturally to the music.,
Find a partner to dance with.,
Place your arms around your partner.,
Sway back and forth slowly to the music.",How to Dance at Homecoming," The better you look on the big night, the more confident you'll feel. This confidence will show through and put you in the mood to break it down on the dance floor.


Ladies, wear shoes that you feel comfortable dancing in. It's perfectly fine to wear heels, but try to find a pair that you can move around in. The more comfortable you feel physically, the more natural it will feel to dance.;
, Dancing alone can feel awkward and isn't as much fun. If possible, go to homecoming with a group of friends and their dates so that you can share in the festivities together.

, Before dashing to the dance floor, take a moment to soak up your surroundings and familiarize yourself with the venue. Take a lap around the room, get something to drink, and head to the bathroom if you need to. Getting comfortable with your environment will make you feel less intimidated by the prospect of dancing in front of others.

, Instead of focusing so hard on what to do with your body, listen to the music first and find the beat. Pay attention to how fast or slow the song is, and how it makes you feel.

, Really listen to the song that's playing and bob your head to the beat in a way that feels natural.

, This is a basic move to get you started. Be sure to stay on the balls of your feet when dancing to avoid feeling planted onto the ground.

, People who are nervous have a tendency to tense up in the shoulder and neck area. Be conscious of this, and let your shoulders fall and sway back and forth as you dance.

, Remember to keep listening to the music as you dance. Try not to focus so hard on whether what you're doing is right, and pay attention instead to whether your body is moving in rhythm with the music.


Don't try to dance faster than you feel comfortable doing. Even during fast songs, you can move at a slow pace, as long as you are streamlined with the beat.

, If you are with a date, then it is expected that the two of you will slow dance together, so grab your partner when the song starts! If you'd like to dance with somebody who isn't your date, then make sure they want to dance by asking them first.

, Typically, boys put their hands around a girls' waist and girls put their hands around the guys' neck.

, You will have to coordinate which way to move with your partner; it may take a couple of seconds for the two of you to get in sync.


If you are dancing with a person with whom you are romantically involved, then pull them close and rest your head on his or her shoulder/neck area.
Don't step on your partner's toes! Be conscious of where you are stepping, especially if you are wearing heels.

Be confident.",How to Dance at a School Dance (for Guys)," This move involves exactly what it sounds like – banging your head up and down like a madman. This dance move is most performed during hard rock songs with heavy guitar riffs.


Make sure you stay stationary while headbanging. Leave yourself plenty of room if you are headbanging near other people. You don’t want to headbutt anyone and injure them, or yourself.
Don’t headbang too hard. It’s easy to throw out your neck or back muscles while rocking out.;
, Moshing occurs most during hardcore rock songs, punk and in heavy metal music. Just about anyone can do it! All dancers gather in one area (called the mosh pit) and jump up and down, bounding off one another.


There’s a good chance this may not be allowed at your school. Moshing is very physical and dangerous, so get involved at your own risk.
If someone you are Moshing with falls down or gets hurt, help them up. Falling down in a mosh pit is dangerous and it's hard to notice when someone gets in over their head. , Breakdancing is a physically intense dance that requires a lot of upper body strength, agility, and skill. Songs with fast hip hop beats are most commonly associated with breakdancing. If you want to breakdance at the school dance, be prepared for lots of practice beforehand.


Start at the beginning. Learn the most basic breakdance moves first. Once you have these down, you can start moving on to the harder dance moves, such as transitions and power moves.
Stretch before you start breakdancing. Like head banging, breakdancing is physically demanding. You don’t want to be carried out of the school dance on a stretch.
Give yourself plenty of room. Breakdancing at high levels involves a whirlwind of legs and arms. Don’t clobber a classmate or teacher with your sweet dance moves. , Freestyle or club dancing involves following your gut and the rhythm – you just make up the moves as you go along. This can include arm, head, torso, and leg movements. Freestyle is great for any kind of music. After all, you’re making the moves.


Just keep moving. There is no right or wrong way to freestyle. Move to the rhythm.
Find music that sparks your creativity. Turn on the music at home and dance in your room. Find the music that gets you moving and inspires you to take chances on the dance floor., The snap dance is a mellow dance often performed during R&B and other smooth songs. Mix it up with some slow freestyle to keep the rhythm going.


Move one shoulder forward and one shoulder backwards in a back and forth motion. Keep one shoulder stationary and then bend one knee and rock to the opposite side at an angled motion. Rock back to the original position while snapping your fingers. Now you’re snap dancing!, These dances involve a whole line of people doing the same exact choreographed moves. Examples of these dances include the Macarena, the Cha Cha Slide, and the Electric Slide.


If you don't know the motions, you can sit that one out to observe the moves, and then give it a try on the next play.
Feel free to jump in the line even if you don’t know the moves. Choreographed dances are more about silly fun than showing off your serious dance skills.
Some country dances fall under this category, such as line or square dancing.

, Techno and similar electronic music are a mainstay at clubs and you might just hear a song or two at your school dance. Elaborate hand motions and smooth body gyrations are the go to moves for slower techno. Faster techno dancing involves sharp movements of the joints.


For a slow techno dance, try the Flower. Open your palms with your wrists together and move them around like you are molding a bowl out of clay. Roll your wrists together so that the back of your wrists are facing one another. Finally, roll your palms back so they are facing one another, and start over.
Faster techno and Eurodance lends itself well to freestyle dancing. When in doubt, follow your sense of rhythm.

, Keep tabs on the latest songs or genres that are sweeping the media. You can expect at least a few of these songs to make an appearance at your school dance, provided they aren’t particularly risk.


Youtube, Vine and Instagram are a prime place to find trending dances. Many will feature hashtags or other markers denoting their popularity.
The Billboard Music Chart has added Twitter trends to its metrics, allowing you to get a good idea of what is trending online in particular. , Some genres of music are more or less likely to be played at your school depending on the location and demographics of your school. Use this knowledge to determine whether you should practice a hip hop dance, or something more club oriented.


School DJs are often chosen from a group of DJs already established as school safe. If the DJ is announced ahead of time, look into their organization to get a better idea of what songs might be played and those that might be banned., Add these to your arsenal for the school dance. You don’t have to learn every popular dance. Even knowing just a few will let you join in when the right song hits. Try a few of these popular hits from the end of 2015.


The Dab. This dance has gained popularity since first introduced and you don't have to look far to find an example of your favorite celebrity or artist giving it a shot. Performing the Dab is simple. Lean forward and bow your head into your bent elbow, like you’re wiping sweat off of your face. Throw your other arm in the air, either behind you or in the same direction as your bent arm is pointing. That’s all there is to it! The Dab fits in with most hip hop songs, but its simplicity means it can find a way into almost any genre.
The Whip/Nae Nae. Two older dances originating in the early 2000s, The Whip and Nae Nae were combined last year, transforming the two into a popular sensation. Hold one arm out in front as through you’re driving a car, while moving to the beat. Follow with the Nae Nae, shimmying your body upward while you raise your arm. Let your personality shine through during this dance!The Hotline Bling. Popularized by the Drake music video of the same name, the Hotline Bling is a collection of dance moves that look like something your dad would do on the dance floor. Commit a few of the more memorable moves to memory. For example, for The Call Me, perform a slow, freestyle sway, but raise your thumb and pinky to the side of your head while doing so, as though beckoning for someone to give you a phone call. , Slow dancing offers a break from the faster paced songs, and is typically performed during slow love songs or R&B slow-jams. Grab a partner (ideally someone you have a crush on) to take advantage of the opportunity.


First place your hands on your partner’s waist. If you don't know where the waist is located, it's just above the hips. Your partner will either place their hands on your shoulders, on your waist, or a combination of the two. More formal dances, such as the Waltz, will instead require you and your partner to lock a set of hands and hold them out to your side.
Move your feet with the beat. Slow dances aren’t terribly demanding – a simple swaying left and right is enough to get you through the song.
A classic and easy step routine to remember is the Waltz. If you are leading the routine, you simply step forward with your partner, then to the right, then backwards, and to the left. This creates a box pattern, and you should finish right where you started. You can spin your partner (or they can spin you) as you see fit. Don’t get dizzy though!

, A controversial dance best suited for fast paced hip hop or R&B songs. Check with your school prior to performing the dance, or at least do so in a way that you don’t get caught.


Have your partner place their hips against yours, with both of you facing the same direction.
Grind up and down to the beat. You can place your hands on their hips if both parties are comfortable with the idea.
Make sure your partner is okay with performing this dance.

, The principles of solo freestyle dancing also apply to partner freestyle. This works well with any type of music that you want to join a partner for, provided the song isn't reserved for formal slow dancing.


Let your partner’s dance moves influence your own, and vice versa. You aren’t necessarily touching your partner while dancing, but you undeniably are working as a team.
If you ever get lost or lose your rhythm, revert to a few simple moves. The two-step is a simple maneuver where you step your right leg to the right and step your left leg over to meet it. Then, repeat back to the other side.
The bounce is another simple move that will help you get back on track. Simply bounce or jump up and down to the beat of the music. Move your arms as desired. , School dances are announced a few weeks prior to the event. Take advantage of this time to gauge another’s interest in going to the dance with you.


If you’re familiar with the person you want to ask to the dance, invite them out to a normal social event, such as grabbing a bite to eat or the movies. Bring up the dance in conversation and ask them nonchalantly, but with confidence.
For example, you could say: “Hey, have you made any plans for the school dance yet? Want to come with? We can show them how to get loosey goosey.”
You might also simply ask: “You looking for a partner for the school dance, or are you going to fly solo? Happy to join you if you need a partner in crime.”
If you aren’t particularly close with the person you want to ask out, try writing a letter or sending an email asking them to the dance.
Avoid working through an intermediary, like a friend. This shows a lack of confidence.

, When someone catches your eye at the dance, don’t be afraid to approach them and ask them to dance. Take a few precautionary measures to improve your chances of them saying yes.


Start some small talk beforehand. Cold opens are a tough sell, and might give the wrong impression, depending on your approach.
Wait for a new song to start before asking. You want a song that is suited to the type of dance you would like to have with your partner.
Make sure the other person is not already in a relationship. If they seem to be close to another or dancing with someone else, they might be taken.

, Whether you ask someone prior to the event, or right there on the dance floor, confidence will help convince them to join you for a dance. Studies show confidence as a leading factor in whether someone finds another attractive. Be direct. Rather than asking someone to dance through a friend, go ask them yourself, preferably in person.

Take care of yourself before leaving to go to the event.,
Do your hair.,
Dress the part.,
Wear clothes that compliment your body.,
You don't have to learn moves to attract attention.,
Don't be too shy to talk with people.,
Over all, have a good time.",How to Be the Most Noticeable at a Party/Dance," Wash your hair, use a little bit of perfume (or body-lotion with a mild, clean and possibly floral or fruity scent) and apply your make-up if you want to. Heavy make-up is not nice if you're in a warm room with lots of people dancing around you. Either focus on the lips or the eyes. Smokey eyes are always cool but don't overdo it. You don't want your mascara running so don't use too much. If you decide to put focus on the lips, use lip-gloss because your lips will get dehydrated. Lipstick is not good when you have chapped lips. If you decide to go with no make-up, bring something that will keep your lips hydrated.;
, Do something that you wouldn't do everyday. If you always wear your hair down, put it up in a bun. If you always wear it in a ponytail, let it loose. If you always wear your hair down, and you still want to wear it down, try to change it up a bit by pulling out the shine serum, or curling or straightening it.

, Wear comfortable underwear that fits. When you feel comfortable, it shows and you look confident. This also goes for the shoes. If this is your first time wearing high heels, you will trip and you will feel uncomfortable. If you are new to heels, go for cute flats or sandals instead. Make sure your shoes fit comfortably. If you're good at wearing heels, and you wear them, just make sure you don't step on someone's feet as you move through the crowd.

, Do not wear a short skirt, without shorts as it may flip up when you dance. The best pick is a knee length skirt, or or a nice dress. Wear something short-sleeved, and then, if you want, take a sweater or shawl. It will get hot. Don't change your style because of an event. Compliment your clothing with a nice piece of jewelry but make sure it doesn't swing in every direction when you dance.

, Just let the music flow through you body, but don't go over the top. Listen to the beat and just move. Close your eyes too, it will make you move better.

, Flirt a bit if you want to, but don't make it look too obvious. Mystery is the best friend you will have. This will not work if you know the people around you, they know you and know what you are like. If it's a big event where you don't know 99.9% of the people, make a few friends and make new contacts.

, Confidence is the best way to go.

Contact your student council or student government if there is one.,

Realize that you will need professional gear.,
Decide what equipment you need.,
Consider extra gear beyond the bare minimum.,
Scrounge up the sound gear from your school.,
Do a test run.,
Get a good program for your DJ software.,
Strike your gear and return it to the rightful owner.",How to Build and Run a Sound System for a School Dance," They usually arrange the dances, and you'll definitely need their support. Keep in mind that if you're not in council yourself, they can be difficult people to convince, as they usually like things done in a consistent way. One good tack to use is to learn of the profits/losses off the last dance and describe how they can be improved. If a teacher is in charge of student council, you might want to approach him/her first, after you spoken the teacher the change will improve that they will listen to you.


If your school does not have a council, you'll want to contact whoever is in charge of the dances.;
, Make sure that you have sufficient time to get all your gear together, arrange this all with the council.

, If you have a lot of time, see if you can find a job in the community that needs volunteer sound/tech work done, like community theater or a music festival, this experience will prove invaluable for your dance, and for yourself.

, Too many times people delude themselves into thinking that they can get away with off-the-shelf Walmart speakers. A ghetto blaster is not nearly loud enough nor high enough fidelity. The same goes for living room hi-fi gear, which tends to have overly exaggerated power ratings (""1000-watt"" surround sound systems which probably only have 50 watts per channel spring to mind). To make your dance work, you can't settle for anything less than true pro-audio gear.

, This depends on the venue, for a gym or another large space, you'll want at the bare minimum a professional power amp, a graphic equalizer, and an audio source (most likely, a computer), and speakers rated for the amp's power (rule of thumb says go twice the rating if possible to avoid clipping).

, Nice things to have on top of that are a mixer so you can cross fade between audio sources, a microphone, and a better source. While you can use a 1/8th inch TRS (from your computer) to RCA adapter with fair results, it's better to use a DI (Direct Input) box to balance the output to XLR cables, avoiding mains hum and other nasty artifacts. Even better would be a professional Firewire recording/playback interface, but these can be hard to get if you are borrowing gear. Lighting equipment is nice, but can be really difficult to get a hold of.


Strobes are nice, as are disco balls and low-level ambient lighting. Set your standards high to start with, because it can be guaranteed you won't meet them.

, This can be a bit difficult depending on where you live. If your school has a music program, that's probably the best place to start. If you already have a teacher sponsor, you might have them talk to whoever is in charge of the gear in order to sway their support. This gear can be hard to get, because it tends to be expensive and easily broken, so don't expect easy handouts. Alternatively, if your school has a theater, you can look there. Theaters are especially good if you need lighting gear - typically they'll have some extra stage lights lying around.


If you can't scrounge up any gear from your school, move on to your community. A few good targets: community theater groups, youth groups, nonprofit music schools, and community radio stations. You might not even know that the last one exists. Try pulling out an FM radio and surfing the dial. In Canada, nonprofit stations are almost always allocated below the 92 mHz band, far below the more commonly listened-to commercial stations. Shoot for the best gear, but remember, beggars can't be choosers.
Rent gear if you absolutely can't find anyone to lend you it. You might be able to do this at a fairly steep cost if you live in the city - check your phone book. Those of you out in the country - keep scrounging.

, Get it all set up and see how it sounds in the venue. Start low and be careful, but don't be afraid to see how loud you can push it. You'll need ear-splitting sound for the night of the show. A good test: stand with a friend in the middle of the dance floor, about four feet away from each other. If the system's cranked and you can still hear each other without shouting, than it's not loud enough.

, You can run gigs with Itunes or Windows Media Player, but it's not recommended. On Windows, Winamp is a reasonable choice. On Mac and Linux, amaroK is an awesome music player with collections, fast search support, and automatic crossfade. There's also an unofficial Windows version available. If you can, It's recommended using a Mac or a realtime Linux kernel because of the better audio support. If you absolutely have to use Windows, use a fast machine. The last thing you want is a lag out in the middle of a DJ session.


Make sure you have a huge media library available. You will be getting quite a few obscure requests, and it's icing on the cake if you can fill them. If you have CDs, rip them to mp3s (or better yet, FLAC if you have the space). External hard drives are nice for this, and relatively cheap - a 1TB drive can be purchased for $250 at the right places.
Try to not stress too much about the gig. And it will be stressful. See below for a couple tips.
Once it's over, fade the music out and bring on the lights. If you have a microphone, tell them it's over (expect some jeering, get a teacher to do this if you prefer).

, Make sure you put it away real nicely to leave a good impression for next time. Coil the cables, leave the mixer settings the way you found them, etc.


Count the profit - it was a lot of work, but it paid off.

You must be open to different variations of dance as well as dancing in different capacities. Not everyone can be a star of a dance troop.Be flexible and think about how you can use dance in different ways. For example, dance therapy may be better suited for your personality. Some professional dance careers require a lot of travel which can present a lot of obstacles if you want to have a family or be in a relationship. Other careers may be seasonal so you’ll have to create a realistic budget for the times that you aren’t dancing.
Many professional dancers take on a second career after they are incapable of meeting the physical demands of dancing. If you become injured or choose to settle in more of a routine, you may have to adapt your dance skills into another career like choreography or teaching.;
, Whether you attend a professional recital, watch a documentary on performance, or read about dance in a magazine, absorb all you can. Take in the choreography and the athleticism required for the performance, the vocabulary used to describe the movements, and any other tidbits that can help you understand the world of dance.Increase your knowledge to broaden your perspective as an artist and performer.

, Try different dance classes and different teachers. Experiment with different dance forms. Budget and prioritize what interests you most before committing to anything. Oftentimes there may be drop-in opportunities available to see if you like a class.Research the origin of a class, as well as the background of your teacher to ensure that it is the right fit for you. There are many different types of dance including: ballet, ballroom, jazz, hip hop, flamenco, african, interpretive, modern, swing, jive, and many more. There are sub-genres and dance is constantly evolving. Learning how to dance will be a continuous pursuit.

, Train in yoga, martial arts, gymnastics, or other athletic pursuits. Build your strength, agility, and coordination to help you when you dance. You’ll be surprised with how each discipline can translate into the other., If you are in high school, you may have dance as part of your physical education program. You may also have lunchtime or after-school clubs. There may also be free lessons at community centers, churches, or at dance studios.Dancing may also be associated with music or drama programs and clubs so be sure to inquire. You may also take purely music or drama lessons to round out your performance skills.

, Audition for community or school productions. Post on community bulletin boards to form your own dance troop. Make your own opportunities when you can’t find what you’re looking for.Social media is a great way to advertise your performance or to find like-minded dancers and performers. You may simply use the search toolbar and type keywords like your city name and Dance Troop. If something comes up, message the group to find out more information. If nothing comes up, create your own group using your search terms as its name so that it will be easy for other dancers to reach out to you. For example, create a Facebook group called Toronto Jazz Dancers.

, Research what different school and dance companies offer over the summer. There are a variety of opportunities for technical development and professional networking. Summer is a great opportunity for travel to attend an intensive dance workshop.Make sure to prepare at least a year in advance as some programs may be highly competitive to enter especially for more prestigious schools. Make your application stronger by adding all your related experience. For example, include all the recitals you have danced in as well as volunteered for. If you haven’t been volunteering or auditioning, you may also include how many views your Youtube videos are garnering or followers your social media accounts have. Any indication of your passion for performance helps.

, There may be pre-professional contemporary dance programs close to you, or art and performance schools in a larger city. Colleges and universities also offer dance programs. There may also be funding bodies to help with your education.There are organizations that assist dancers who are outside or currently in a dance career. Attend career planning conferences and workshops to find out what funding is available.

, You may develop technique and skills in dance performance if you attend a pre-professional or conservatory-style school. A college or university will provide you with academic credentials, and a degree may be handy in your post-performance career. Ask yourself:What does the program focus on?
What is the curriculum?
Is there a degree or diploma upon completion?
How long does it take to complete the program?
What resources are available to me in terms of facilities (studios, gyms, change rooms, showers, computer rooms, offices, etc)?
What is the background of each instructor and faculty member?
Are there any guest artists or performers who will be around?
What performance opportunities are offered?
What have alumni gone on to accomplish?
What is the location?
What are the associated costs?
What are the admission requirements?

, If you have decided to attend a school or participate in a program, give yourself enough time to meet all the application requirements. You want to show your best so give yourself enough time to edit and go over any questions with an administrator., If you don’t have the time or money to enroll into a program or school, you may also work to get an internship or mentorship. Network with local dance schools, studios, or ensembles and seen if they would take you on as an intern. You may also approach individual performers and create a rapport to hopefully build a mentorship.Internships and mentorships can be both highly competitive and difficult to achieve. You may have to sacrifice your time without getting paid. You may also need to find the right fit to ensure that you are getting the most out of the relationship. Some people may use the opportunity to exploit free labour. Don’t let your passion blind you. This needs to be a mutually beneficial opportunity.

, There are numerous dances to learn and you can find classes in forms including:Ballroom dances originating from the Renaissance and becoming popular in hit tv shows like Dancing with the Stars: waltz, Viennese waltz, tango, cha-cha-cha, rumba, samba, mambo, quickstep, jive, and bolero.
African-American and traditional jazz dances that are strongly linked to African-american music and culture: Charleston, swing, tap dance, moonwalk, and boogie-woogie.
World and latin dances that originate from outside of North America or that are associated with a particular culture: salsa, flamenco, Argentine tango, lambada, polka, jive, east coast swing, capoeira, country/western, folk, and belly dance.
Professional performance dances that may include some of the most complicated and revered dances including: ballet, contemporary dance, concert dance, modern, and tap dance.
Modern dances that continually evolve as advancements in music technology evolve: house, punk, rave, disco, and bollywood dance.
Hip-hop and funk dances that originated in the 1970s and are continually evolving and staying popular thanks to tv shows like America’s Best Dance Crew: breakdance (breaking), bounce, electric boogaloo, street jazz, jookin’, locking, and popping dance.

, While you may be talented and have natural ability, hard work is the only thing that can distinguish a career. Be prepared to put in years of sweat, tears, and injuries.Stay dedicated. Dance every day and never lose focus. Your work ethic will dictate your career. Have self-discipline and keep your goals in mind. Get inspired by your peers and immerse yourself in the artistic community., Be humble and respect the process. Accept that you must continually learn and put forth your best effort. You will never know how well you will perform without actually performing. If it doesn’t turn out as you expected, take the opportunity to learn and improve.Failure is inevitable. Grow and move forward each time you fail. Value the times you succeed after you have failed as you have embraced the lesson it taught you.
Learn all that you can. Don’t rest on your laurels. Even if you find an instructor, choreographer, or teacher difficult to work with, you can find a lesson in your experience. Learn what you can, and think of everything as an opportunity.For example, if you find an instructor who insists you come to class on time and closes the door if you’re late, you can learn the importance of punctuality for auditions.

, There are many factors that can end a dance career abruptly like injury, company becoming bankrupt, illness, etc. Use each performance to express your passion for dance. Treat even your practice routines and exercises as if they were your dream performances.Passion is infectious and you never know who is watching.

, Focus on honing your craft. You can’t control everything so don’t waste your energy and talent worrying about outside factors. Be open and positive about what your future holds. It may be physically taxing but don’t let your emotions bring you down as well.For example, if you did not get called back after an audition, follow up and ask what you could have improved on. You may not need to call if you already have a sense of what your weaknesses are. Continue to practice to correct your mistakes.
Be confident. You must be willing to take risks. It’s okay to feel anxious if an opportunity comes up. You may need to travel around the world, perform a difficult move that has evaded you in practice, trust a new partner, or perform for the public for the first time. Embrace the challenge.For example, if you’re nervous about an audition, focus on the fact that you were called to audition. Think about all the other people who don’t even get a chance to show what they can do. Focus on the fact that they obviously see something in you that’s right for them. You don’t have to do anything more than be yourself.

, Experience performance first hand. You may learn a lot from discussion, reading, and attending class but there’s nothing like performing. Don’t limit yourself to finding stage time. Ask to perform in front of peers, family and friends.Prove you are valuable. Become indispensable by working hard and putting in extra hours. Arrive early and stay late. Make sure you know the day’s material, be prepared, don’t disrupt class with any negative opinions, and work hard.Practice as much as possible. Only putting in minimum effort will bring you the minimum result. Don’t expect any favouritism from your teacher if you think you have the talent. Push yourself to go beyond your comfort level to grow as an artist. Push yourself to go beyond the class requirements., Focus on what makes you happy. While money, performance, school, or placement in a competition can affect your mood, look at your life as a whole and remember who you are on the inside. There’s a lot to life other than dancing.Ignore negativity. As your career progresses, you may become more of a public figure. Performance is inherently ripe for criticism. You won’t be able to please everyone. There will be critics amongst friends, family, peers, and the media. Concentrate on what feels right.Ultimately you want to do what makes you happy so the opinions of other people shouldn’t matter as long as you have given your all.
Avoid politics and drama. Don’t get caught up with what others are doing. It may seem like there are class politics or something may be unprofessional but focus on your craft. Always work on what makes you happiest., Be in the moment. Don’t think about past mistakes or opportunities. You may get injured if you are distracted by thinking about past mistakes. Focus on the fundamentals and the movement.For example, if you are approaching a move that you have trouble with in practice, focus on the music so you don’t think about the move itself.

, In the beginning, it may be difficult to find work and you may need to perform for free to improve your skills and network. Make sure that you know your value and that you are not being exploited. Make sure you are fully aware of your payment agreement and try to get signed contracts whenever possible.For example, if you have booked a role and are given a contract to sign, ask to take a day to read it over. You can then take it to a local dance studio to ask working dancers or instructors whether the rate and duration is acceptable. You should only work for free for a finite number of hours. Dance studios are a great place to get advice from peers. You can find both seasoned dancers or beginners also looking to break in. You should only work for free if you are learning new skills, networking, building your resume, or enjoying the experience.

, You must mature as a person to mature as a dancer. Gaining life experience will inform your performance. You will be better prepared to deal with the nerve-wracking life of a professional dancer having gone through your own challenges in life., Connect with others through social media. Post on the walls of your peers and like their work. Become involved in forums. Take interest in both local and national projects. Learn to shoot, edit, and share your work. You want to be a prominent voice in the community.Connect with as many people as you can and work or organized projects to bring people together. You can only succeed by putting yourself out there.
Create a Youtube account. Put yourself out there and showcase your performances. Youtube gives you a great opportunity to dance without having to audition or be part of a school or company. Build a following and your may be able to create opportunities for commercials, music videos, or tours.Build your brand with other social media accounts. You can post links to your Youtube videos on your Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram accounts. Create free profiles for these social media sites to expose your talent to as many people as possible.
Post frequently and regularly. Create a following by posting quality videos consistently. Make sure you create a schedule that works for you.

, Depending on your location, you may have to travel far for auditions. This may include hotels and airfare so save regularly to keep a healthy audition fund. The audition process may take several days to months so be prepared to have the finances ready.Beginner dancers may need one or several sources of income to supplement their dance. Create a budget so that you are able to support yourself until you feel that your dance career is at a point that you are comfortable.
Research if you are eligible for a scholarship, apprenticeship, or fellowship. There may be local or national organizations that help fund emerging creative talent. Apply early and make sure that you meet all the requirements., While studios can be a tight knit community, you never know where your opportunity will arise so don’t be afraid to learn from different studios. Different teachers will often have different approaches. Learning from a number of people can help you find your own style and philosophy.If you have the time and money, you may want to narrow your search to teachers and studios who have a good reputation within the industry. You also want to learn different styles of dance because it can open doors and lead you to a path you didn’t know existed. For example, while you may have been drawn to dance because of ballet you may find that hip hop dance gives you an opportunity for a television series.

, Bunions, blisters, corns, floor burn, toe splits, and broken bones are all very real parts of dancing. Make sure to take every precaution and don’t neglect your feet. Rest and allow your wounds to heal or you may suffer permanent damage., Think of your body as a machine that needs the right fuel to function. Junk food and a poor diet can make you lethargic and generally make it difficult to perform. Certain foods give you energy and focus to perform at your peak. There are both long term and short term benefits to adjusting your diet.Protein during breakfast can wake you up and give you fuel for the rest of your day. You may also snack on nuts, hummus, quinoa, granola, and fruit to keep you energized throughout the day. Have a salad in the evening. You may also have tea with anti-inflammatory ingredients like ginger or turmeric. , Training may take up all your time. If you are a student, a full-time worker, or a parent, you must make sacrifices to fit in your practice time. Your social time will mostly be spent training or recovering. You must take care of your body especially if you are expending all your energy in long days.Even if you’re not training you could be warming up, cooling down, rolling out your muscles, cross-training, and sleeping. All these activities will help you prepare your body each day. You don’t want to compromise all your hard work with a preventable injury., Dancing is like any other career and you must learn how to present yourself. If you are freelancing, trying to get a side gig, or applying to a program, you must be able to write about yourself and pitch why you deserve an opportunity.You also have to learn how to pitch yourself for social media, to network, or to get an agent to work on your behalf. Writing a proper bio and resume includes your name, contact information, education, and experience. You may ask instructors to help format your profile or resume to meet current industry standards. you may also find templates online. If you search a famous dancer online, she most likely has a brief bio on her webpage. You may follow her formatting while making sure the personal information of the profile reflects your own.

, Dance is a competitive field. You need people that will support, listen, and understand what you are going through. Ensembles can be close depending on the dynamics of the cast. Foster a healthy relationship with everyone you work with and come across. You never know when you’ll need a shoulder to lean on.Learn to choreograph and collaborate. Don’t limit yourself to working with dancers. Find other artists, actors, musicians, and designers to create your own performances. You may not have a feature role for a while so develop your repertoire by collaborating in different projects. You will also have the added benefit of learning how to deal with different personalities from different disciplines."

",How to Convince Your Principal to Let You Have a School Dance," In order to organize and carry out the plans for a school dance, you need a fair amount of people. Make sure these students are fairly well regarded in the school because if you are talking to the principal you will need to show you have responsible team to support your idea.


Print out ""Help Wanted"" flyers and pass them around to students and teachers. DON'T be afraid to to ask people. They most likely want the same thing as you but are too shy to speak up about it.
Ask the leaders of involved extracurricular clubs and teams at your school to talk to the groups. Students who are involved in school-organized clubs and activities are more likely to take interest in a school function like a dance. Try asking if you have one. They're usually the ones who handle school functions. Also, you could talk to a sport or club who needs more publicity in the school. They might be willing to help out.
Get the student council involved. This will help to get the word around, and it may even better your chances at winning the administration's approval.;
, It's crucial that everyone involved gets the memo You can't run a school dance without people knowing important details, such as the theme, considered dates and times, dress codes, etc. School dances are really hard if you're unorganized. Have a good foundation with people who are natural born leaders.


Work together to decide on a theme that is fun, feasible, and school appropriate. Some popular themes include Wild West, ""Under the Sea"", ""A Night in Manhattan"", Hollywood, ""Sock Hop"" and

, Alternatively, depending on the time of year, you could choose to have a holiday or seasonal-themed dance, such as Halloween, Valentine's Day, Christmas, etc.


Construct a dress code. To avoid revealing, risqué dress, come up with a list of Do and Don't

Follow the standard school dress code. The dress code most likely already addresses rules against overly revealing, skimpy clothing, offensive symbols, slogans, and/or images, and colours/symbols that promote violence, sex, drugs, and other subject matter that is not appropriate for school. It's a good idea to clearly state that for the dance dress code, all of the same rules



, It's way easier to handle dress code when you have a theme. choose a theme for the dance and everyone will follow. It's way easier to catch the students who stand out in a crowd of hippies while wearing booty shorts.




Consider the formality of the dance. For formal dances, students may be required to wear nice, formal attire; this means no jeans, tennis shoes, baggy clothes, t-shirts, baseball caps, etc.


Make a list. This includes needed supplies, such as decorations, food, beverages, etc., as well as volunteers to decorate, set up, clean up afterward, etc. Assign different roles and

,


Provide music. You could hire a DJ, but if your school is a little low on cash, maybe you could find a student or parent willing to do it for free. Alternatively, among the student body, there may very well be aspiring musicians, vocalists, or bands looking for gigs. Just make sure that the music played at the dance is relatively clean if somewhat suggestive, and does not promote subject matter that is inappropriate for school.

Decide on the type(s) of music that should be played. Make sure that at the dance, you play music that everybody can enjoy. While you can't please everybody, try to add as much variety



, Compromise! You can check Billboard on the hottest music too.

, You can sell cupcakes, pizza, ice cream and other foods. Be creative!

, Put a portion of the proceeds toward the school football team, art department, air conditioning units, etc. When the proceeds go to a good cause, the dance becomes a fundraiser, which will appeal to the administration. This also goes along with having a club or sports team sponsor you.

, They have the best interest of the students.

, They may suggest a different theme, or a different date. Think of this not as criticism, but as constructive advice. Ask them for advice when you and your planning group have trouble making decisions.

, Type up the ideas and plans that you and your group have decided upon, and have your proposal read over by adults before you submit it. Also try to avoid using low diction. Try to sound like you know what you are talking about and sound very educated. Your principal is going to expect the best out of you, so live up to his/her standards and maybe if you give a good enough proposal, he/she would

Prepare conversation topics ahead of time.,
Consider the atmosphere.,
Have an anecdote or two prepared.,
Talk about current events.,
Approach people or groups that don’t intimidate you.,
Join a conversation in progress.",How to Avoid Being Socially Awkward at a College Party1," If social interaction stresses you out, think of a few topics that you are comfortable discussing. Before the party, come up with questions or responses you might give regarding these topics. If you practice possible conversation scenarios ahead of time, you won’t have to worry about thinking on the spot. Possible topics include:


Memes or viral videos you think are funny.
The latest celebrity faux pas posted to social media.
Opinions on new music and film releases.;
, You might be super excited about your topic for the final paper, but will your peers grasp the main idea while they’re dancing to loud techno music? Think of topics that can be easily understood in a loud and over-stimulated environment. These topics might include music, class schedules, or anything else that is simple and within your conversation comfort zone.

, This short story could stem from personal experience, an episode from your favorite TV show, or a post you saw on social media. Add some humor if you can, but don’t panic if you can’t. Humorous or not, snippets from your personal life will flow easily because they are genuine.You could say:


“For the longest time, I thought Prince was singing, ‘Don’t party like an overlord’ in ‘1999.’ Good thing I never tried that song at karaoke!”
“I still can’t decide if my favorite of the Doctor’s companions is Martha or Rose. They were both equally great.”
“George Takei is one of my favorite celebrities to follow on Twitter. He’s either thought-provoking or flat-out hilarious!”

, Almost everyone attending a college party is connected to social media, giving them common ground when it comes to current events. However, specific topics will depend on the type of party. If it’s a toga party, you’ll want to focus on pop culture references or on-campus quirks that interest you. If it’s a Pride Week party, you could talk about politics or activism.

, If you recognize a classmate who you’ve never talked to, here’s your chance. If you see someone who also looks a bit nervous, a conversation eases both of your anxieties. Simple ice-breakers include:


“You sit behind me in physics, right? I’m Jennifer. Nice to meet you.”
“So what brings you here tonight?”
“I’m actually a physics major. What about you?”
“I hear these parties are always a hit. Is this your first, or have you been to a few before?”

, Stand close enough to glean what others are saying. Introduce yourself to the people closest to you, and ask if you could squeeze in. Observe the reactions of the others in the group, and do what they do. For instance, if someone tells a funny joke, laugh when the others laugh."
"
On the night before the dance, get your hair done, a cute top and jeans or a skirt, and a pair of matching shoes.,
Skip the cocktail dress, and depending on your school, unless it's semi-formal, consider skipping a dress entirely.,
Become familiar with the songs.,
Also, don't be afraid to dance with no one at all.,
Dance like people are almost not there, just try to get the beat right though.,
Make sure you do not sit in the benches or chairs by the wall, trying not to attract attention, when you really want to dance.,
When you are having fun dancing to the techno beat or R&B/hip-hop joints, the DJ will unexpectedly say something like, ""Hey you lovebirds out there, get ready for the slow dance."",
If you can't find a friend to go with, find one there.,
Beware of the cool kids!",How to Dance at a Middle School Dance," This is your first dance, and you should feel comfortable. For guys, just wear a nice graphic tee and a pair of jeans. If its formal just a nice white, button up shirt and a pair of black slacks/pants with black shoes. Remember, white socks do not go with black shoes. Be sure to put your best hair on,(like a wedding ) and use conditioner.

l
, Don't act like anyone else, be yourself. If you want to get someone to dance with you, don't be afraid to jump out of your seat, and ask who you want to dance with.If whoever you ask turns you down, THEY should be ashamed, not you.

, Listen to the radio and get to know most of the words to popular music. Also, learn dance songs such as Teach Me How to Dougie, You're A Jerk, Wobble, Wop, Single Ladies, Cat Daddy, Cupid Shuffle, Cha Cha Slide, Macarena, Like the Bernie, and Crank That. The DJ will most likely be playing these songs, and if you know them, it'll make you feel part of ""the crowd"".

, Sometimes its just more fun to dance with your best friends. Just don't make your dance group too big, there needs to be space for everyone!

, Or else people might look at you like ""what are they doing?!"". No one can resist a crazy girl or guy. Consider dancing and having fun. The girl who dances and has the most fun is the most gorgeous girl in the room. Just go all out, jump up and down, and have fun! People aren't jealous of the people with the pretty hair; they are jealous of the people having the most fun!

, People might look at you and wonder, ""Why isn't he/she out on the dance floor?"" Just care less about what the others think of you. If you really want to dance, get out there and have fun.

, Then they will put on slow music and you need to find someone to dance with. Some of you will be too shy to dance with someone unknown so it’s OK to dance with your girlfriends. But for those with their partner, be ready to slow dance; or if you don't want to or think no one will ask, go to the bathroom or get something to eat or drink. Relax a bit because you might be tired out with the faster songs. Listen to the beautiful music and the lyrics of the slow dance. The guy will put his hands on your hips (or higher if you guys want to get comfortable) and you will put your arms on his shoulders. Just sway and move your feet side to side. It might seem awkward at first, but everyone feels a little embarrassed, so just relax!

, Many people from your school go to dances, so try to find someone new. But make sure they're not weird, because you'll get burned about it later.

, Many of them go to school dances, so you have to be careful. Make sure you're not in the big clump of wannabe's near their group of friends, because you'll be considered annoying. And many of them take pictures with their phones for social networking sites (Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, etc.) so you don't wanna be the kid in the background striking a crazy pose and having people call you ""Disco Girl""! Thus concluding, that if you aren't one of them, don't be near them!

Relax before the party.,
Bring at least one close friend to the party.,
Take a breather.,
Stay sober.",How to Avoid Being Socially Awkward at a College Party2," Parties are not as big of a deal as they’re cracked up to be. A few hours before the party, go for a jog, do some yoga, or find a quiet space to meditate. Any of these will help you to shake off some stress. When you begin to relax, your thoughts will flow more naturally and you will be able to be yourself without your anxious thoughts holding you back.

, Choose a friend you can rely on and stick with for the night. Friends can keep you calm by pulling you out of awkward conversations or jumping into them. They will also make it less uncomfortable if you decide to step back for a while and not talk to anyone else.

, If you feel yourself getting flustered at the party, excuse yourself for a second. Go to the bathroom or step outside into the fresh air and gather your thoughts. Remind yourself that there’s nothing to feel uncomfortable about, it’s just a party.

, Introverts sometimes use alcohol as “liquid courage.” However, getting drunk hides the real you. Worse, you could end up doing something you’ll regret the next day. When you stay sober, you maintain your self-control and actually reduce the risk of social awkwardness.If you don’t drink alcohol, you don’t have to feel left out. You could opt for punch or a soft drink. Ginger ale, if available, can mimic the appearance of white wine or beer. If opaque cups are available, you could drink water from yours. No one has to know your drink is alcohol-free.

Ask the host if there’s a dress code.,
Wear an outfit that makes you feel confident.,
Don’t wear anything too thick.,
Opt for a loose and light-colored top.",How to Avoid Being Socially Awkward at a College Party3," At most parties, partygoers wear their street clothes. However, in college, especially around Rush Week or certain holidays, some parties require a bit of conformity. If it’s early in the semester, the fraternities and sororities might throw toga parties. If it’s closer to Halloween, you could be going to a costume party. You might have to wear red for a Valentine’s Day party. While each outfit will have some degree of individuality, standing out too much could trigger social awkwardness.

, What you wear to a party can determine whether you’re fidgeting all night or feeling comfortable and relaxed. Wear an outfit that reflects you. If you feel confident in your outfit, confidence in your social skills is right around the corner.


Even if there’s a dress code, you don’t have to sacrifice confidence. If you’re nervous about wearing a toga, ask the host of there’s some wiggle room in the dress code. Maybe you could wear a white tank top and white trousers under your costume. If black isn’t your color, forget about the Goth costume for Halloween and opt for something a bit lighter.

, Thick fabrics can cause you to sweat, increasing your internal stress levels. In the winter, wear a jacket over your party outfit. If it gets too hot, stash your jacket in the coat room, or ask the host where you can hang it.

, Lighter colors do not attract heat as well as dark colors do. Looser clothes allow more air to pass between the fabric and the skin, making the wearer feel cooler and less likely to sweat.If you do sweat, a loose top will not stick to your skin and pick up embarrassing sweat stains.

Hang out by the buffet.,
Head to the dance floor.,
Check out any games in progress.,
Give yourself a role at the party.",How to Avoid Being Socially Awkward at a College Party4," The food table is a social hot spot that always has a flux of people. If you find yourself alone, make your way over to the refreshments. This location eases social anxieties and takes the spotlight off you.Food generates conversations. People love free food, so party goers will always make their way over to the chips and dip. If you are getting a plate of food at the same time as someone else, strike up a discussion about how great the punch is or how bad the quiche is.
The refreshments table allows you to be occupied. This is one of the few places at a party where you can be alone and not look awkward. If you are holding a drink or a plate of food, you’ll be less likely to fidget.

, This is another social hot spot where you can be occupied. You don’t have to dance to every song. If the DJ is playing your favorite song, you can dance to that. When the music switches to something that you don’t like, use that as an excuse to get something to drink. You can dance with others or by yourself.


If you don’t feel comfortable dancing, don’t worry! You and other spectators can talk about the music or engage in some light self-mockery. (“Last time I tried to dance, my friends thought I was trying to shoo away a swarm of gnats.”) On the other hand, if you choose not to talk to anyone, you could use your attention to your peers’ moves as an excuse.

, Whether you plan to participate or simply observe, see if any games are taking place. While games like beer pong and “I never…” usually involve alcohol, you might be able to find one or two (like air hockey or foosball) that do not. If more than one game is going on, you will have a choice of what to play. On the other hand, if you choose to just watch, you and other spectators will have a mutual conversation topic.

, Take it upon yourself to introduce people to each other, make or distribute drinks, or tell the DJ what songs people want to hear. These interactions require you to be more talkative and let your social side shine."

Establish whether or not the girl you want to ask to a dance has a trainer or someone that she works with when she practices jumps on horse back.,
Don't worry about it being awkward.,
Plan out a jump course, with the help of the trainer.,
Give her ""answer"" signs.",How to Ask an Equestrian to a Dance1," If you are bold enough, ask her parents for her trainer's contact info, or ask what her trainer's name is and do a bunch of research, or ask another horse girl for help with contacting the trainer. If you are determined enough to even be considering these grandiose gestures, getting a trainer's name shouldn't be a problem.;
, Most trainers will think that it's sweet that you are using the girl's love of horses to ask her to a dance. Just be genuine and see what they think of your plan.

, Make signs to ask her to the dance. Put something like ""Prom? -Jerry."" Maybe use a banner and attach it to the poles. Whatever the trainer thinks is best (some horses may find a flapping banner tied to the jump scary).

, There should be two jumps; one that says yes and one that says no, so she can give you an answer based on what the jump she chooses reads.


Be prepared to cope with rejection. Despite all your efforts, she may still say no. Going to all this effort may come of as desperate and pathetic. Your intended dance date may just think you don't have the guts to just ask her or that you think life is really like all those slushy, over-the-top teen movies. That being said, you actually went to the trouble to make a jump asking a girl to a dance, she may say yes.

Get a bunch of horseshoes.,

, That is kind of important.

, Get there about 30 minutes earlier so you can paint her horse. Make sure the trainer or barn manager is there to help you handle the horse, because they can be quite unpredictable creatures!

,
Use some horsey-humour.",How to Ask an Equestrian to a Dance4,", Try something like ""You stirrup my emotions, I can't rein myself in. I know it's a bit tacky and you maybe think I mustang with the wrong crowd to come up with lines like this but, please come to the dance with me"".

If he has a girlfriend, then he is probably going with her.;
, In the event that your first choice is taken, having backup will ensure that you are not left without a date to the dance.

, Consider asking him in person or via telephone if you have his number. It is also totally acceptable to ask him through email or Facebook message if you don't want to do it face-to-face.

, If you are doing the asking in person, then approach him and say hello.


Be sure to smile and act confident, even if you are extremely nervous. Most guys like girls who are confident and have self-esteem. (Don't act pompous or cocky, though).
Wear something that makes you feel attractive. If you feel beautiful on the inside, then it will show on the outside.

, Ask him whether or not he is going, and if he has made any plans.


If he already has another date, then don't ask him to ditch his current date to go with you. It is unfair to the other girl, and will come across as desperate and insensitive.

, Be sure to smile and look him in the eyes if you are doing the asking in person.


Share your current plans with him, if you have any. For example, if you and your girlfriends have rented a limousine, then tell him. This will help him make his decision, and show him that you have a fun evening planned.

, If he says yes, then tell him you are looking forward to it, but don't jump up and down screaming; you don't want to make him regret his decision! If he says no, then graciously tell him that there are no hard feelings, and move on.

, Decide who will pick up whom, where you will meet, and what color dress you are wearing if it is a formal dance so that he can determine what color to wear.

If you don't know him personally, wear something that stands out from other people at the dance.


Ask your friends for advice on your outfit.
Wear something modest but cute. You don't want to give him the wrong impression, but you still want to attract him.Don't go to the dance wearing something that makes you feel uncomfortable. If you feel uncomfortable, it'll reflect in your attitude and lower your confidence.;
, Locking eyes with someone lets them know that you're interested in them, which in turn, raises their interest in you.Making eye contact before you approach him will clue him into the fact that you're interested. Smile if he looks back, so he knows that you like him.


If he looks down when you lock eyes but continually looks back into your direction, it may mean he's interested in you.
If he smiles back and keeps looking at you, it's a sign that he likes you back.

, Dancing with your friends is a great way to loosen up and get used to the thought of dancing in front of your classmates. Form a circle and dance with each other. Keep making occasional eye contact with the boy you're interested in and maintain a smile.


Read Learn-to-Dance if you don't know how to dance.
Dancing can improve your self-confidence and reduces anxiety., If you're nervous about approaching him and asking him to dance, then another strategy you can use is to talk to his friends and tell them that you're interested. He may end up approaching you if he gets this information from a buddy.


If he is shy, there's a chance he will want to approach you but may be too nervous to do it.
His friends may not tell him that you want to dance, so prepare to do the work yourself if all else fails.

, Think about what kind of song you want to dance to. Do you want to dance to something more energetic and fun or do you want to slow things down and get romantic? If you like the boy, pick a slow song. If you just want to be friends, pick something more energetic.

, There are ways you can appear more confident with how you act. Standing up straight and maintaining eye contact with him will make you look more confident than if you were to look down at the ground or slouch.Approach him when he's alone so that his decision isn't affected by the people around him.
Walk up to him when you feel comfortable, but don't wait too long, or you may miss your opportunity.

, Before you ask him to dance, see how he reacts to talking. If he's excited to talk to you and seems enthusiastic, it's a good sign that he likes you back. If his feet are pointed away, he rubs his neck or face, or he looks uncomfortable, he may not want to dance.If he ignores you and walks away to talk to his friends, it's a sign he isn't interested.
Just because he doesn't say a lot doesn't mean he's not interested in you. He may just be nervous.

, Once you talk to him about how he is, ask him to dance with confidence. You can ask him to dance by saying ""Hey, do you want to dance with me for the next song?"" Wait for his response and if he says yes, take his hand and go to the dancefloor.


He may be too nervous to dance. If he doesn't want to dance, then sit down next to him and talk to him.
If he says no, try not to get too upset. Go back to your friends and try to enjoy the rest of your night and dance with them.

, You may feel nervous approaching the boy you like, but sometimes the best thing to do is just to go for it.The worst thing that could happen is the boy says no, and it hurts your feelings. Understand that even if he doesn't like you, it doesn't mean that you aren't attractive or likable. It just means that you weren't meant for one another.


If you let your fear and anxiety win, then you'll never know if he wanted to dance with you.

, Holding his hands or putting your arms around his back or shoulders will help you move as one. Try to move with him and avoid stepping on his feet. He may be new to dancing as well, so adjust his hands and arms if they are slipping too low on your waist.For slow songs, put your arms around his back or shoulders.
If things feel awkward or tense, you can always back off and dance by yourself in front of him.

, You don't have to talk while you dance, and you probably shouldn't for slow songs. However, if you feel awkward during other songs, a good way to relieve tension is to talk to the guy you're dancing with.You can ask him how his day went or how he feels about a certain class.
Avoid talking badly about other people if you don't know him well. He may be friends with the people you are talking about and could get upset.

, If you like the guy that you danced with and want to talk to him after the dance, make sure to get his contact information. Ask him for his phone number, or the usernames for social media accounts. If he danced with you all night, there's a good chance that he will want to stay in contact with you.


You can say, ""Hey, I really liked dancing with you. Do you want to talk later? Do you have a cell-phone or a Tumblr account?""

Know what not to do.",How to Ask a Guy to Prom," If your guy is a prankster, get him back with this cute trick! You can either design your own ""ticket"" or print one out from the internet. Write the question on the slip of paper and then leave it for him on his windshield. He'll go from feeling confusion and anger to having a big smile spread on his face when he sees that you got him good. Remember that it doesn't have to look too convincing -- just seeing an envelope with a piece of paper in it on his windshield will be enough for him to think it's legit.;
, Get some car markers that can easily be washed off and invite your crush to prom on his back windshield. If you're feeling artistic, then you can draw something to accompany your message. Think of something that relates to his interests, such as football, soccer, a musical interment, or a cartoon character. You may not want to take up his entire back windshield -- make sure he can still see when he drives. If you really want to do it up, you can even tape some balloons to his car.

, Not every guy has a car, right? You can find lots of other places to stick the post it, from his locker to one of his textbooks. Just make sure it's in a place where he will definitely see it and that it won't blow off. You can even go fancy and spell out ""Will you go to prom with me?"" or just ""Prom?"" by writing just one letter on each post-it.


This option is a little bit less risky, since post-its are easier to remove. Take into account how well you know the guy and gauge which method would be more appropriate.

, The next time the two of you hanging out watching movies or playing video games, suggest ordering delivery pizza. Make the phone call yourself (discreetly) and ask the restaurant to spell out ""prom?"" in pepperoni or veggies. Remember to make sure he opens the box first! You can also get a friend to ""deliver"" the pizza for you, or you can even have it delivered to his house when you're not there.


You may want to consider calling and ordering the pizza beforehand so that he doesn't overhear anything.

, Invite him out to a sushi dinner and ask the chef to arrange the sushi so that it spells out ""prom?"" Again, you will need to either call the restaurant beforehand or sneak over and talk to the waitress when your date isn't looking so that he will be surprised! Alternatively, you can invite him over for sushi and arrange the pieces on a dish yourself. Though handling fish with your bare hands may not be the most alluring thing in the world, he'll be impressed by your creativity.

, If you are on a sports team or a member of a club at school, ask a few of your teammates to pose next to each other with the letters ""p"" ""r"" o"" ""m"" and ""?"" spelled out on their t-shirts, swim caps, shorts, or whatever is applicable. How can he say no to a photo of five smiling, beautiful faces? You can also take a photo of your friends dressed this way and send it to him, if it's too hard to orchestrate this live.

, Everybody loves cat pictures; that's just science. Write ""will you go to prom with me?"" on a notecard and tie it around your (or a friend's) cat's neck. Snap a picture and send it his way!


If he's a dog-lover, do the same thing with a canine friend instead. If you really want to do it up and you have a dog, you can take a walk by your crush's house with a note saying ""Prom?"" attached to your dog's collar and have the dog go up to him. This can be a little hard to pull off, but if you do it right, you can get major bonus points for cuteness and style!

, Okay, this is definitely the less romantic route, but if your guy has a sense of humor (which he hopefully does!) snapping a goofy prom invitation will definitely win him over. Take a picture of yourself either wearing or doing something silly, and write ""will you go to prom with me?"" in the text line.


Use the drawing feature to decorate the picture and make it more interesting.

, If you play an instrument and/or sing, then write a little jingle that incorporates lyrics asking him to prom. This will not only get the message across in a thoughtful way, it will also remind him of your musical abilities, which will be sure to win his heart.


You can either play it for him in private, or if you are feeling daring, do it in front of the whole school at the next assembly or football game! Just know that, if you do it in public, you'll be putting the pressure on both him and yourself.

, Ask your teacher for an extra scantron next time he or she administers a multiple-choice test. Fill in the bubbles to spell out ""prom?"" and either hand it to him in class or slip it in his locker. You can even hand it to him and say, ""You dropped this"" or ""You forgot your chem test"" and then walk away with a smile.

, Sure, there are plenty of creative, funny, artistic ways to ask him out, but there's always the option to just walk up to him in the hallway at school and ask him straight-out. He may even appreciate it more if you just talk to him straight from the heart instead of looking for fancy ways to impress him. This is especially a great move if you're really close to the guy and know each other on a deep level; then, it won't be such a leap to tell him that you want to take him to prom without any fanfare.


Remember that if he's going to say yes, he's going to say yes no matter how you do it. If you're running out of time or can't think of any ideas, then ask him now before he agrees to go with somebody else!

, If he likes basketball and even often plays outside or after school, then you can write ""Prom?"" on a cheap basketball in black marker and bounce it in his direction. It may take him a minute to realize that something is written on the ball, but once he does, a big grin will spread on his face.

, Prom, anyone? If your man is more of a tennis player, then you can get a bucket of tennis balls and stick them in a fence to spell out, ""Prom?"" He'll be impressed that you made such an effort.

, Tie a balloon to his locker or his car and write ""pop me"" on it. He'll pop the balloon and inside, he'll find a note you write asking him to go to prom with you. You may even want to write that he should search for the note inside!

, The old note approach can never be overdone. Just pass him a note in class, put it in his locker, or have a friend pass it to him in the halls. In the note, you can ask him if he'll go to prom with you and leave a super-big check box for ""yes"" and a tiny box for ""no."" If nothing else, the note will make him smile! Also, asking him this way is still cute but a bit more private.

, Write your question in chalk near his car or in a place where you know he's bound to see it. Just make sure you're not writing anything on private property in the process.

, Ask him to borrow a textbook or a notebook of his (if you have a class together or something -- otherwise, it may be too obvious). The next day, you can return the book to him with a cute bookmark made of construction paper that asks him to prom. He'll be impressed by how much thought you put into asking your question. This will be an especially good move if you and the guy have been study buddies together in the past.

, Who doesn't love a note left in Tootsie Rolls, M&Ms, or Reese's Pieces? You can also use bite-sized versions of Snickers, Milky Ways, or another piece of his favorite candy. Leave your candy note in a place where he's likely to see it, such as in front of his locker (or taped to it), on the hood of his car, or even his doorstep, if you're feeling bold.

, Does he have an obsession with Legos? Or is he just the kind of guy who would think it was awesome if you prom-posed in Legos? It won't take long to write out ""Prom?"" with Legos, and he'll love the gesture. Just find a good place to pose your question, such as his normal seat at lunch.

, What guy doesn't love cookies? Bake him a batch of his favorite cookies and write one letter of ""Prom?"" on each cookie, so he gets the message. And hey, who says girls have to bake? If that's not your thing, get him a hamburger and ask in the lid. The important thing is that you give him something he loves to eat while racking up some creativity points.

, This works best if you have French, Spanish, or another foreign-language class together. You can write him a note in the language you're studying that asks him to prom. You can hand it to him and be sly, asking, ""Hey, do you have any idea what this means? I can't figure it out."" He'll be solving a little riddle while translating the message ""for you."" Obviously, he has to be game for this to work!

, When's the last time you wrote -- and even mailed -- a letter? This can be a cute and unique way to ask your guy to prom. If you're too shy about mailing it to his house or don't want to come off as too intense, you can have a friend hand deliver it to him.

, So what if what you're doing is considered atypical? You should go for what you want instead of waiting around for the phone to ring. If you know who you want to go to prom with, then you should take the initiative and ask him. The worst that can happen is that he says no and you end up finding another date. The best that can happen is that you impress him with your creativity, your confidence, and just the fact that you're not like a lot of other girls. Be proud of yourself for asking and know that it's worth the risk. Many guys go through the same worries, and it's perfectly natural to be afraid that things may not go your way.

, Though a fun, wacky, crazy, or showy prom-posal can be a great way to snag a date, you have to think about where the guy is coming from, too. If he's a really shy guy who keeps to himself, he may not be into a huge prom-posal in front of half the school. This may actually embarrass him and make him feel bad if he doesn't want to go to prom with you. Doing something cute and private may be the better route to take, depending on the guy. When you decide how to make your decision, just make sure you're thinking as much about what you want to do as how he will react.

, Though there are no hard and fast rules about what not to do when you ask a guy to prom, there are a few things you should stay away from, if you have any doubts. Here are some things to think about:


Ask around subtly, if you can. Make sure the guy hasn't been talking about asking another girl or doesn't have ""a thing"" with another girl before you ask him. If you do, this can make him feel bad.
Don't have your friends ask him for you. Show that you're confident enough to do the asking yourself -- even if your friends help you with the process!
Most of all, don't be down in the dumps if things don't turn out the way you planned them to. If you didn't take the initiative to ask the guy, then you would have been in the same place you'd be in if you asked and he said no. This way, you can be at peace with his answer and start your search for the perfect prom date anew.

If he has a girlfriend, then you can safely assume that he is going with her.
Don't ask out a guy if he already has a date. It will reflect poorly on you if he says no, and be unfair to the other girl if he says yes and ditches his original date.
If it turns out that he already has a date, then think of one or two other guys that you'd like to go with and ask them.
If you can't find out whether he already has a date, then don't worry. Ask him out anyway.;
, If you're feeling confident and up to it, then ask him out in person. Otherwise, you can ask him via phone call, text message, email, or Facebook.


If you're planning on asking out a friend or somebody you have been dating or otherwise romantically involved with, then consider coming up with a sweet, thoughtful way to ask, like leaving a note in his locker.

, Wear something that makes you feel confident and beautiful on the inside, and you will appear confident and beautiful on the outside. If you plan on asking him out in the middle of the school day, then pop into the ladies bathroom to make sure that there's nothing in your teeth and that your hair is set.


You should still try to look nice even if you are asking via phone or computer. Though it doesn't really matter what you wear, looking nice will at least help you feel more confident, even if he can't see you.

, Not only does a woman look her best when she smiles, smiling will show him that you are interested in him and that you're a positive, fun person to be around.


Regardless of who the guy is, everybody wants to be around happy, fun-loving people. Even if you're feeling self-conscious or nervous, force yourself to smile; chances are that you'll instantly feel more relaxed.

, Don't try to ask him out when he is busy doing something else or seems to be in a rush to get somewhere. Consider asking him out during the school day, either during a break, at lunch, or in between classes.


If he is with other people, then pull him aside so that you can talk privately. Asking him out in front of others could potentially be very embarrassing for one or both of you.

, Whether you are asking in person or not, you should first greet him with a casual ""Hey, how's it going?"" before blurting out the question. Striking up a casual conversation will help you ease into the topic of homecoming. Plus, if homecoming is right around the corner, chances are that your conversation will naturally lead to the topic.


Try to fit a reason, compliment, or incentive into your question. For example, tell him why you want to go with him: ""I think it'd be really fun if we went together,"" or ""I think you're really cute and I was wondering if you'd like to go to homecoming with me.""
If you have plans of any sort, like limousine service for the ride there or a pre-homecoming party with a group of friends, then let him know. These types of incentives will show him that he'll be in for an exciting night if he goes with you!

, Whether he says yes or no, you should try to maintain your composure and continue being friendly. If he by any chance says no, then let him know that there are no hard feelings. If he says yes, then make the necessary plans; decide who will pick up whom, tell him what color dress you will wear so that he can coordinate, etc.

Post it on social media.",How to Ask Your Boyfriend to Prom," Your boyfriend may have made plans for the prom before you started dating, or he may have no intention of going to the prom. If you want to go together, you need to ask him to make sure you're on the same page.


It's a good idea to ask a few months in advance so you can come up with other plans if your boyfriend can't go with you.;
, It may be that your boyfriend is already in the process of planning an elaborate promposal for you, in which case, you wouldn't want to ruin it by asking him first. Before you ask him, consider talking to his friends and/or family to find out if he has something in the works.


Certain guys may have a problem with a girl asking a guy, so make sure to think about how he will feel.

, If you decide that asking your boyfriend to prom is the right decision for you, it's important to keep his individual preferences in mind. If your boyfriend is shy or easily embarrassed, you may not want to go over the top with a public promposal. If he loves attention, then don't be afraid to make it a big spectacle.

, It's important to keep your boyfriend's interests in mind when deciding how you will ask. Show him that you put a lot of thought into the invitation by incorporating something personal,


If your boyfriend loves sports, think of a way to incorporate his favorite sport into your promposal. You could, for example, spell out your message with basketballs or baseball bats.
If your boyfriend is a movie buff, consider incorporating a funny quote or picture from his favorite movie into your invitation.
If your boyfriend belongs to the robotics club at your school, consider using a toy robot to deliver your invitation.

, If you want to keep things really simple, you can just ask your boyfriend directly if he would like to go to prom with you. You can make things a little sweeter by presenting him with a small gift or card.


Asking him when he least expects it can be a nice surprise!

, If you don't want to ask him in person, a note can do the trick! You can send it by mail, email, or social media, or you can slip it into his locker when he's not looking.If you want to get a little creative try writing a poem or using a silly pun in your note. You could, for example, give him a teddy bear with a note that says, ""I can't bear to go to prom without you.""You can also give him choices by providing check boxes on the note that say things like ""yes,"" ""definitely,"" or ""can't wait."" If you give him a ""no"" option, make it much smaller than the others., You can write ""prom?"" on just about anything, so get creative and write your message out in a totally unique way.If you can get your boyfriend's parents to let you in his room while he's not home, you can spell out ""prom?"" for him at home. You can use just about anything, from colorful paper or balloons, to basketballs for a sports-obsessed boyfriend.
If you can't get access to your boyfriend's house, you can decorate your own house and then invite him over.
Consider making a meal or sweet treat for your boyfriend and spelling out “prom?” with an edible ingredient, like small candies on a cake or pepperoni on a pizza.You can even write ""prom?"" with a simple marker in an unexpected place, like inside a pizza box or on a piece of paper that you hide in his textbook.

, Make your boyfriend do a little work to decode your promposal by giving him puzzle to work on..


If you are good at illustration, draw a promposal message on paper. Cut it up into puzzle pieces and wrap it for him to uncover.
You can also create a custom word-search or crossword puzzle that contains your message.
If you want to get a bit more elaborate, set up a scavenger hunt for your boyfriend, with each clue leading to a different part of the message.

, Before you decide on a public promposal, make sure you think carefully about the ramifications. If you think your boyfriend might be embarrassed by a public invitation, it may be best to stick to something more private. It's also important to consider the possibility that your boyfriend might say no, so a public invitation may be embarrassing for you as well.

, If you want to make a big display of your promposal, consider decorating something that everyone else will see, like his locker or his car. You can use sticky notes, streamers, wrapping paper, balloons, and anything else you can think of to make your message extra flashy.Consider hiding your message inside of a balloon to keep him guessing.If you want the message to be semi-private, you can decorate his front lawn or garage door so he will see your message as soon as he gets home (and so will all the neighbors).

, Get friends involved in your promposal by having them spell out a message for your boyfriend. They can each wear part of the message on their clothing, or they can carry large signs.You can make this kind of promposal as public as you want by choosing the right location. If you just want his friends to be there, arrange it around a small get-together. If you want the whole school to see it, you can have your friends display their message in the cafeteria or at a sporting event.
If your boyfriend plays a sport or is involved in a club, he might really appreciate it if you incorporated these interests into your promposal. For example, you could arrange for the members of his football team to spell out ""prom?"" with notes taped to their helmets, or you could ask the drama club to hold up a banner for him at the end of a performance.
You can even have your friends do a performance for him, like a choreographed dance or a skit, if they're willing.

, If you want a truly public promposal, try to put up a giant banner or sign where everyone will see it.If you have a large budget, you could rent space for your message on a billboard or jumbotron, or even have an airplane sky-write your message.
Only use this method if you're absolutely sure that your boyfriend will not mind a grand display and you're fairly confident that he will say yes.
If you're working with a limited budget, consider asking your school if you can hang a banner somewhere visible. You can also consider asking a nearby local business if you can hang your sign on their building or use their changeable sign to display your message for a few hours.

, If you're brave enough, you can try asking your school if you can make the daily announcements and ask your boyfriend to prom in front of the entire school.

, If your boyfriend is a social addict, post something on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, or another social media site. Make sure it is appropriate, because it will be on the Internet forever.


Depending on your own personal preferences, your message can be simple and to the point, or it can be more elaborate. You could, for example, consider posting a cryptic message that he needs to decode or picture of yourself holding up a sign asking him to prom."

Find out if your prospective date has already been asked by someone else.,
Find out what your prospective date likes.,
Be prepared for rejection.",How to Ask Someone to Prom1," It would be a huge bummer to put in a bunch of time and effort into a clever way to ask him/her to prom, only to find out that he/she is going with someone else. To save everyone an awkward couple of minutes, find out if he/she has already been taken.


You can ask your prospective date directly if he/she has a date by subtly mentioning prom. Say something like “Are you excited for prom?” Hopefully he/she will allude to having a date or not in his/her answer.
Get your friends to do some serious recon. This method works especially well if your friends are also friends with your prospective date. Get them to find out if he/she is going with anyone.;
, It would be weird to ask your date to prom by serenading him/her with a country song if your date hates country. Also keep in mind that some people don’t want to be asked in an elaborate way, while others hope for the entire school to be in on it.


Again, be subtle. When you’re talking to your potential date, say something like “Did you see how Timmy asked Sandy to prom? He had practically the whole school in on it!” If your prospective date says, “Yeah, it was awesome!” he/she would probably be in to getting asked in a creative way. If he/she says, “Yeah, it was a bit much” then you should probably opt for a subtler method with which to ask him/her to prom--potentially even just asking them in a straightforward way.

, This step applies to every method you might use to ask someone to prom. Occasionally, people do reject invitations to prom. There are many reasons why someone might say no, but just stay cheerful. Accept rejection gracefully, even though it sucks. As they say, there are more fish in the sea.


Smile and say something like, ""Thanks anyway! I hope you have a good time with whomever you go with.""
If you don’t want to go with anyone else, consider going stag (which means going without a date.) Get a group of your dateless friends and all go to prom together. A lot of the time, dates don’t stick together for the whole prom anyway--there is a good chance you can still dance and hang out with the person you were hoping to go with.

"
"
Go for the straightforward invitation.,
Wait for a moment alone with your prospective date.,
Tell him or her why you think he/she is incredible.",How to Ask Someone to Prom2," You don't have to ask someone to prom in an elaborate and creative way. If you know your potential date is a no-frills sort of person, he/she will probably appreciate a kind and sincere direct invitation more than an elaborate one.

, When you two are alone, start out with a normal conversation and try not to be too nervous or act differently than you normally would.


This way you don't make the other person feel pressured by yours or their friends.

, Remind your prospective date of fun times you have had together in the past. After a bit of build up, ask if he or she would like to go to the dance with you.


Say something as simple as, “You and I have so much fun together. Would you like to go to prom with me?” or “I don’t know if this prom is going to be fun or not, but I know I would have a good time with you. Would you go to prom with me?”

"
"
Leave a clever note or sign for your date.,
Use a standard sign or giant note.,
Make a cute pun.,
Employ the use of a t-shirt.,
Use balloons.",How to Ask Someone to Prom3," Planning out where to place a sign or deliver a note may take some planning, but you’ll most likely enjoy yourself and your date will have a cute memento after prom is over.Keep in mind that asking with a note or sign means that you most likely won’t be there when your prospective date gets your invitation. You will have to wait to find out what his/her answer is when asking with a note or sign, so be prepared for a bit of anticipation.

, Make a sign that says “-Name of the person you are asking-, Will you go to prom with me?” and then below the words, make three check boxes with Yes, No, and Maybe written next to each box. Have him/her check which box represents the answer.


To make this option more elaborate, make a small version of the above sign on a piece of paper and put it in an envelope. On the envelope, write To:-his/her name- and From:-your name-. Have a friend hand deliver it to your prospective date and wait until he/she opens it and marks one of the boxes. Then send him/her send it back to you via your “mail carrier.”







, Puns, while cheesy, are often a cute way to ask someone to prom. Everything about prom is a little cheesy anyway right? So do it up and get down with the puns.


Candy puns: Leave a trail of some kind of candy that ends in a sign with a clever candy-pun on it. Example: Leave a trail of Hershey’s Kisses for your prospective date to find (somewhere like at his/her house or yard might be good so that random people don’t pick them up and eat them. Not that most people eat candy off the ground, but still, it could happen.) Place a sign at the end of the trail that says something like ""Now that I've kissed the ground you walk on, will you go to Prom with me?""
Food puns: Fruit can be good for more than just an addition to your parfait. Example: Place a cantaloupe and a honeydew melon on your prospective date’s doorstep. On the cantaloupe, write (either with permanent marker or by taping a sign on) “I know we cantaloupe…” On the honeydew, write or tape a sign that says “...But honeydew you want to go to prom with me?” Example 2: If you’re more a veggie person, buy 9 large peas (sugar or snap peas are best.) Using permanent marker write one word on each pea from the following sentence: “Pretty peas will you go to prom with me?”
Crime scene pun: If you are both really into CSI, try out this prom pun. Lie down in front of the person's house. Have a friend trace the outline of your body with chalk. In your chalk outline, write (with chalk) ""I'd DIE to go to prom with you"" or ""My attraction to you is FATAL. Will you come to prom with me?"" and then write From: -your name- underneath your chalk outline. With this method, make sure you get his/her parents' permission, or else even a ""yes"" from your date might get overridden by a ""no"" from a parent who doesn't appreciate chalk graffiti on their property.

, Purchase a plain white cotton t-shirt and write prom on the top of the t-shirt in permanent marker. Write your name on it in permanent marker somewhere on the t-shirt. Then write 10 other names on it (of your gender) with washable marker. Wrap the t-shirt up, (or put it on a giant teddy bear!) and leave it on your prospective date’s doorstep. Leave it with a note that says to wash the shirt to find out who is asking him/her to prom. Make sure to tell them not to wash the shirt with any other clothes, as the whole point of this is that the washable marker names will wash away, but they could seriously stain other clothes.


To find out your date’s answer you can either write your phone number on the back of the t-shirt in permanent marker and tell them to call you, OR you can add in the note that he/she should wear the shirt to school tomorrow if the answer is yes.

, Everyone likes balloons--they’re bright, cheerful and easy to write on. Buy five balloons and write a P R O M ? on each balloon. If you have a class with your date, go into class early and ask your teacher if you can leave the balloons are your prospective date’s seat. When your date comes in and sees the balloons, wave at him/her or walk up with a rose and ask something like, “well what do you think?”


Alternatively, if you don’t have class with your prospective date, buy a sixth balloon and write “From, -your name-” You can also do this even if you do have class with him/her just to make sure he/she knows who is doing the asking.

"

Ask your date during a public event.,
Get sporty.,
Ask during intermission.,
Ask at a school rally.,
Ask during lunch.",How to Ask Someone to Prom4," An invitation issued during a large event will always stick out in your date's memory and--if you play it right--can be done for free. Think about potential venues for you to do this: during a football game, the intermission of the school play, at a spirit rally, or during another event where a lot of people you both know will be present.


Keep in mind that the downside of asking your prospective date in front of an audience is that if you get rejected, your whole audience will know. If you feel confident that your prospective date will say yes, or if you just don’t care what your audience thinks, than by all means bring in the public--and more power to you!

, There are many ways you can tie sports into your prom question. If you both play the same sport, you might want to do something that involves that specific sport. If you are considering doing something at a school sporting event where you will get the announcer in on the question, make absolutely sure that your prospective date will be at the game.


If you know your date will be at a game you are playing in, get your teammates to help you out. Before the game starts, or at halftime, get your teammates to grab cones and spell out ‘Prom?’ with them (you could also get them to lie down on the field and form ‘Prom?’ with their bodies but that would take a lot of coordination.) Get the announcer to say “-Your name- would like to know if you will go to prom with him/her, -Name of your date-.”

, If you are in the school play, or even if you’re not and have friends that are in the play, get permission to go up on stage during intermission. Again, make sure your prospective date is in the audience. Either ask the question out loud (perhaps dramatically, you’re on stage after all) or with a sign. As an extra step, get the lighting crew to find your prospective date in the audience and put the spotlight on him/her.

, You could also walk out into the middle of the field or room with a bunch of roses or balloons and have the announcer announce, “-Your name- would like to know if you will go to prom with him/her, -Name of your date-” while the spotlight is on you. Again, for an added bonus, try to single out your date but putting the spotlight on him/her as well.

, While it might not seem like lunch is a big event, all of your friends and peers are there. If you want to make asking your date a big production, ask him/her at lunch. You could ask him/her in any number of ways, like with balloons as mentioned above, but adding an audience will make your question even more exciting.

Send your date on a scavenger or treasure hunt.,
Buy a dozen roses.,
Write 11 clues on slips of paper.,
Place the roses in each of the hiding spots you have chosen.",How to Ask Someone to Prom5," Of any of the ways to ask a date to prom, a scavenger hunt may be the most time consuming, but it is also a super cute way to do it (and is fun for both you and your prospective date.)

, Thornless roses are best for this method because your prospective date will be gathering the roses and holding them in his/her hands.


You do not necessarily need to use roses-- you can really choose any object so long as you buy a dozen of them. For instance, you could use a dozen footballs, a dozen wrapped cupcakes, a dozen skateboards...you get the picture.

, Tie a clue to 11 of the roses (or whatever object you have chosen to use.) Don’t make the clues too hard or your date may never find you. To make it easier, place the roses within walking distance (around your school perhaps?) so that your prospective date can get to them easily.

, Place yourself in the last spot, holding the last rose (or other object.) If possible, have a friend go with your prospective date on the scavenger hunt--that way your friend can text you when your date is getting close so you don’t just have to sit in the same spot for an hour.


If you want, along with the rose you can also hold a sign that says ‘Prom?’ just to make it really clear as to what this scavenger hunt is all about.

Write a song.,
Enlist the help of your animal friends.,
Use a pizza.,
Make a prom puzzle.",How to Ask Someone to Prom6," Who doesn’t love to be serenaded? If you are musically inclined, pick up a guitar (or banjo, or mandolin..etc.) and create a short song that ties in your prospective dates name and the big prom question.Get a band involved. If you’re in a band, even better. You can write a song together to serenade your prospective date with. Another option is to bring your band mates to your prospective date’s house. Have each band mate hide behind a tree. Ring the doorbell and make sure your prospective date is the one standing at the door. If you play an instrument, begin playing and singing your song. One by one, have each band member step out of their hiding places so that eventually your prospective date has an entire band on his/her doorstep.

, Animals are cute and make every situation more awesome. If you have a pet that will let you do this, tie a sign around his/her neck with the word ‘Prom?’ written on it. You can take your pet to your prospective date’s house and stand on the doorstep with a bunch of roses/chocolates etc. beside your pet. Your date will be so overloaded with cuteness she/he will have to say yes.


Another option is to take a picture of your pet wearing the sign and email/text/Facebook the picture to your prospective date. This method is best if your prospective date is super allergic to animals.

, Over a pizza with pepperoni on it. Move the pepperonis around so that they spell out the word ‘Prom?’ If you don’t have enough pepperonis, buy a separate pack and add as many as you need. Double check that your prospective date is home, either by calling the home phone or getting a friend to text your date, asking what he/she is up to. Go to your prospective date’s house, ring the doorbell, and pretend that you work at the pizza delivery place. When your date says that he/she didn’t order anything, say something like, “oh let me just check…” open up the pizza and show him/her the pizza (with the words.), Buy a piece of cardstock (colorful cardstock is a nice touch.) Write “Dear -date’s name-, will you go to prom with me? From, -your name-” on the cardstock. Cut the cardstock up into puzzle pieces. Put the pieces in a box and give the box to your prospective date."

Talk to your date and ensure that they are comfortable attending prom with you.,
Remember that some people may be homophobic, prejudiced, inconsiderate or just plain rude.,
If you haven't already, let your other friends know that you are bringing a same-sex date with you to prom and that you may need support throughout the night (especially if you are aware that some people are prejudiced).,
Remember that prom is about having fun, remembering the good times and enjoying yourself.,
Be aware of your rights as an LGBTQ+ citizen.,
Have fun!",How to Attend Prom with a Same Sex Date," Some people may be anxious to reveal publicly that they are LGBTQ+, and you do not want your date to be unhappy.


If you have been dating for a long time and your relationship is publicly known, this may still be an issue. Don't assume that just because most people are aware of you, your partner is completely happy with the situation.





;
, Not everyone is accepting, and some people may treat you badly because of your sexuality.


Learn some comebacks so that you can quickly respond to negativity towards you and your date. For example, if someone says something along the lines of 'But you're a girl/guy and so are they!' you could reply with sarcasm, 'Really? I thought that we were both martians!'. Keeping good humour around the negativity will make prejudiced people relax a little around you, as well as warding off any more inconsiderate comments.







,


'Coming out', or making others aware of your LGBTQ+ status may be a good thing to do before prom so that people who may have been rude or prejudiced otherwise would have time to prepare.







, If someone is being inconsiderate towards you and your date, remove them or yourself from the situation and carry on with your evening. You deserve a good night, and if people are spoiling it, you have the right to ignore them and keep them away from you.

, In countries such as the UK, you can't be denied anything based solely on your sexual orientation. If, for example, a teacher or an organiser tells you that you and your date can't dance together, or can't have a photograph in a romantic context that heterosexual classmates have been allowed, tell them that you know your rights and you know that they can't deny you them just because you are LGBTQ+.

, After the first five minutes, it is likely that no one will care that your date is the same gender orientation as you. If they do, it's their night that they are spoiling, not yours!

Compliment her.,
Talk to her parents.,
Respect her.,
Don't be afraid to dance with her.,

Show her attention.",How to Be a Good Prom Date (for Guys)," Prom is not just about the dance itself. The prom experience includes transportation, pictures, dinner, the after party, and more. Offer your assistance with the planning process to not only share ideas, but also to show you care.


Discuss whether you will be attending prom with a group or whether you two will be attending alone. Coordinating plans with a larger group requires more time and effort.
Decide the best time for pictures and dinner, and what time you plan to arrive at and leave from prom.;
, Decide whether you will be renting a limousine or whether you will be picking up your date in your vehicle. While you may be in love with your vehicle, your date may prefer a more romantic gesture like a limo (which can be quite pricey).


If you decide to drive your vehicle, be sure to put gas in the vehicle the day before to avoid running late.
Make sure you car is clear of clutter and both the interior and exterior are cleaned.
If you will be renting a limo, be aware that they are usually booked by the hour and most companies have a minimum number of hours for which you must reserve the vehicle.
Whatever form of transportation, make sure you exit the vehicle to retrieve your date and always hold the door for her or allow her to enter first.

, Girls usually put a lot of time and thought into their outfit and they expect their dates to look just as great as they do. Because prom is usually a black tie affair, be sure to dress formally and to be well groomed for the occasion.Wear a nice suit or tuxedo to make sure your dress is formal enough for the occasion.
Find out what color your date is wearing so you can coordinate small details like socks, ties, and pocket squares.
Pay close attention to your hygiene that night including showering, shaving, getting a fresh haircut, and using cologne (sparingly).

, Corsages are small bouquets of flowers that are presented to your date as a sign of respect. Traditionally, they are worn on the left shoulder or left wrist if the dress is strapless or spaghetti strap.


A boutonniere is a similar (but smaller) version of the flower bouquet that is pinned to the male's suit. It is customary for the female to present the boutonniere to the male and it usually matches the corsage (but it is not necessary).
You should try to coordinate the corsage with your date's gown or choose neutral colors such as peach, white, or pink.
Many different flowers can be used depending on style and budget including roses, lilies, carnations, and orchids.
Because prom season is a peak season for florists, you should order your date's corsage 1-2 weeks in advance to ensure the florist has enough time to create the custom bouquet. Although you order in advance, you should try to pick your order up no sooner than the day before prom.
Keep the flowers looking fresh by spritzing with water, keeping it in the container, refrigerating it, and using a sealant which can be found at any flower shop., Because there are so many stops to make on prom night, being prompt is incredibly important. Aside from that, nothing makes a worse first impression on a girl (and her parents) than being late.


Have an itinerary or a plan of action. Know your schedule ahead of time so you know exactly what time you have to leave one spot in order to arrive at your next destination on time.
If you know you are chronically late, determine what is making you late (enjoy the rush, easily distracted, trying to get too much done?)By doing this, you can be more realistic with time and learn how to overcome your chronic tardiness.
Don't plan to leave on time. Plan to leave early so you leave some wiggle room for the unexpected.

, The actual prom dance only lasts anywhere from 2-4 hours so many people choose to have post-prom activities to keep the fun rolling. Discuss possible plans with your date so you can plan accordingly. (Will you have to take the limo back? Will you need a change of clothes? Will you need an overnight bag?)


In an effort to keep students safe, many schools will host a post-prom activity at a local entertainment center like a bowling alley or skating rink. Be sure to know how long the event lasts, if there is an entry cost, and how you will arrive.
Cruise around. If you have a limo, this is a perfect way to burn off the extra hours of paid time you may have remaining. Drive to spots in your city or town where you've never been or spots that are known to be romantic in nature.
Attend a house party. Naturally, there will be a few post-prom parties thrown by students. Before planning to attend, be sure to respect your date's rules and curfew, and make sure you aren't putting her in any dangerous situations.

, Chivalry is known as a code of ethics for how men treat women.. The best way to describe it is to be courteous, respectful and helpful to your date. Open doors for her, pull our her chair, if she is cold give her your jacket. In general, put her needs first and she will be happy.


Chivalry doesn't always fit in with modern dating methods. So be sure to tune into your date's responses to your actions to ensure you aren't going overboard with the niceties.
Avoid some of the outdated modes of generosity such as ordering for your date, standing each time she enters/exits the room, or defending her honor. Be polite but know that she's a modern day gal who isn't helpless., Sincere compliments not only break the ice, but they can also help to build bonds of trust and to make the mood cheerful and jolly. When complimenting your date, be unique instead of using generalities, and avoid making crude or overtly sexual compliments--especially if you're complimenting her appearance.


Be unique. Instead of saying, ""You have a nice smile"" find a unique feature that draws you in such as, ""I love that freckle on your neck. It's pretty cute.""Avoid compliments about touchy subjects like weight. Even though ""You look skinny in that dress"" seems like it would be a compliment, many girls may take it the wrong way.
Every girl loves to be complimented on their appearance, but avoid cheesy phrases like ""hot"" or ""smoking"". Instead, stick with classics like, beautiful, stunning or gorgeous.
Don't just compliment her looks, compliment her personality too by saying something like, ""You can always make me laugh,"" or ""I can talk to you about anything.""

, Although it may be an uncomfortably nervous situation, talking to your date's parents in a respectful manner shows a level of maturity that they will appreciate. If you can engage her parents in thoughtful conversation, your date will be more likely to relax and feel comfortable in your care for the evening.


Show that you have good manners by saying ""please"" and ""thank you"" and referring to your date's parents as Mr. or Mrs.
Engage them in conversation. Respond by answering with more than a simple 'yes' or 'no'. Show that you are interested in getting to know them.
Give them your attention. Avoid being rude by flipping through your cellphone or watching the television during conversation.

, When a man shows that he admires a woman for more than just her looks, she tends to return the same respect in return. By showing your date that you value the qualities and abilities that make her who she is, you create the atmosphere needed to have a magical night.


Talk to her in a courteous manner. Avoid cursing, telling dirty jokes, putting her down or making sexual remarks about her body.
Avoid pressuring her. Never make a woman feel forced to do anything she is not sure she wants to do including drinking alcohol, having sex, or going places she doesn't care to go.

, Most girls really don't care if you're good or not, they just want someone to have fun with. Whether you're slow dancing or dancing to an upbeat song, try swaying or stepping left to right to the rhythm, and try not to be too stiff.


For slow dancing, place your right hand on her left hip or on the small of her back and offer her your left hand at about shoulder level. As the leader, you can choose to either sway side to side or choose a ""step touch"" motion that follows the smooth beat of the music.
If hand placements make you nervous during slow dancing, you can choose the ""hug dance"" instead. The male simply places both hands on his date's hips while her hands go about his neck. Foot movements should be kept the same.
If you're nervous about moving to the beat of fast-paced songs, just remember to move to the beat. Shuffle your feet or step from side to side, relax your upper body so you can move your shoulders and head, and throw some arms into the mix too.
Keep it clean and avoid dirty dancing. Remember to respect your date.
If all else fails, dancing in groups is not only fun but it takes the pressure off of you. Popular group dances with choreographed moves like the ""Cupid Shuffle"" or ""Copperhead Road"" are always great fun for shy dancers.

, Remember that prom night isn't meant to be completely about romance. It's better to have several friends with you, aside from just your significant other. If you don't share the same group of friends, be sure to spend ample time with each group of friends, and not just your own.


Even though your date may be head over heels into you, that doesn't mean that she doesn't want to share this magical night with her girl friends too. Remember to not monopolize her time or to get jealous when she chooses to dance with the girls and not you.
Not everyone goes to prom with a date. Remember that it's okay to share your date with her dateless friends.
Remember, to be flexible. If you opted to go to dinner with her friends, remember you will still see your buddies at prom or even after prom. You should both be willing to split your time evenly.

, Affection is act of showing someone you really care through small gestures that make them feel wanted and appreciated. It can be something as simple as holding her hand, hugging her unexpectedly, or even just smiling at her.


When showing romantic affection (slow-dancing, kissing, etc.), make sure that the two of you are alone to make the moment special.
Sometimes less is more when it comes to public displays of affection (PDA). Hand holding, hands around the waist, and closed-mouth kisses are fine in moderation.Avoid open-mouthed make out sessions, touching in private areas, licking or biting, and groping.

, By paying attention to your date, your let her know that she's your #1 priority. Put the phone away, listen to what she says, laugh at her jokes, and don't get sidetracked by other friends (or worse, other girls). Let her know that you enjoy her company by showing her that she is interesting and important.


Eye contact is important when showing interest in a person. During conversation, make sure you are face-to-face and not looking at the dance floor, or your cellphone (even if you're nervous).
Listen more than you speak. When you listen and take an interest in what your date is saying, you won't have to fish for something to talk about; the conversation will naturally evolve and you'll find yourself jumping in at the right time.

Remember that even if a girl says no, the gesture will be appreciated.,
Determine whether she already has a date.,
Keep your options open.,
Decide how you'd like to ask her.,
Consider asking her in person.,
Ask via phone or computer.,
Think of a romantic gesture.",How to Ask a Girl to Homecoming," Part of what makes people so nervous about asking somebody out is the possibility of rejection, or the idea that she will somehow be upset or annoyed that you asked her. But keep in mind that being asked out is flattering, no matter what the circumstances, and that you will probably be making her day just by asking her.;
, This will save you a lot of time and trouble, and allow you time to make other arrangements, if necessary.


If you don't know whether or not she already has a date, try asking one of her friends, or bring up the topic of homecoming with her so that you can inquire about her plans.
Don't try to convince her to ditch her date if she has one. It will be unfair to the other person, and reflect poorly on you. Remember: just because you aren't going to homecoming together, doesn't mean you won't have a chance with her in the future!

, Think of other girls (if any) that you'd like to ask out so that you're not left hanging in the event that your first choice says no. Having backups will also help ease some of the nervousness you may be feeling.

, You can ask her straight up either in person, over the phone, or over the computer. If you're feeling more creative, come up with a less straight-forward romantic gesture like leaving a note or flowers on her car or in her locker.

, If you want to keep things old fashioned and simple, then ask her in person. Here are a few tips to get you started:


Choose the right time to ask her. Don't ask her out in the middle of class or if she appears to be in a rush. You should also avoid asking her in front of other people. If she is standing with a group of friends, ask her if you can pull her away for a moment to talk to her.
Initiate a friendly conversation with her first, and then casually bring up the topic of homecoming. Be sure to properly greet her and ask her how her day is going before you do the asking.
Consider working a compliment into your question. For example, say something like ""I think you're really awesome and fun, and I was wondering if you'd like to come to homecoming with me.""
Remember to smile and look her in the eyes. This will hold her attention and show her that you are genuinely interested in her.
Be prepared, but don't follow a script. While you will probably work out a general idea in your head of what you want to say, avoid memorizing what you want to say word for word. Let the conversation flow naturally.
Act confident, even if you are trembling inside. Confidence is key, and can make or break her decision. Be sure not to act overly pompous, though, as this is a turn-off for most girls.

, In this day and age, asking somebody out via text, Facebook, or email is not always acceptable, though is understood and used by many. This route is especially useful if you are very shy, nervous, or unsure about her feelings toward you. Plus, if she for any reason says no, you will have time to compose yourself before facing her in person.


Be sure to properly greet her and strike up a casual conversation before you pop the question. Try an open-ended greeting like: ""Hey, how's it going?"" ""Hey, how's your day been?"" or ""Hey, what are you up to?"" Questions like these give her a chance to tell you what she's been up to lately, and what her plans are for the next few days/weeks. If homecoming is just around the corner, chances are that the conversation will inevitably lead to a discussion of what her plans are.
Try to work a compliment into your question. This will make her feel special, and undoubtedly put a smile on her face. Try something like: ""I think you're really fun/smart/beautiful/interesting, and I was wondering if you'd like to go to homecoming with me.""
Consider a more indirect approach. Instead of asking her straight-out, first ask her what her plans are for homecoming. This way, if she already has a date or is going to be out of town, you can determine her answer without having to ask her. If she says she's not sure or doesn't have a date, use that opportunity to ask her.

, This route gives you the best of both worlds: it is both anonymous (meaning you won't be face-to-face) and romantic. Only choose this route if you already know the girl relatively well and think she might be interested in you. Otherwise, it will come across as overwhelming. Think of something that you think she'd appreciate, based on what you already know about her. Consider the following ideas:


Leave a note in her locker or on the window-shield of her car.(Make sure that it is secure and noticeable.)
Send her flowers with a note attached asking if she'd like to go out with you. Try to find out what her favorite flower is for an extra touch.
Write her a cute/funny song. She'll be so charmed that she'll have to say yes!
Paint the question on a cupcake, t-shirt, white board, or other item. Use your imagination! You don't have to write the whole question out; a simple ""Homecoming?"" will do.

, You want to create a smooth canvas and mask any veins or discoloration. Also,blend it well, so that you see no harsh edges.

, Your crease is the line you see with your eyes open/closed. If you have a monolid/hooded eyes (a.k.a you can't see the crease with your eyes open), apply it above, so that it is visible. Blend it well! Blending is key here; no harsh edges are allowed.

, It is the farthest point of your lid and extends up to the crease/fake crease. Then blend it in,bringing the color inside the lid. Again,blend it really well.

, Try to avoid shimmery whites because they don't look good in photos.

, Don't over blend, because you'll lose the intensity.

, Clean them with a fan brush (a special type of brush that looks like a fan) or makeup remover wipes (normal wet wipes are too harsh on the skin).

, This step is optional. Place a dot on your cheeks, nose, chin and forehead and blend with a brush, your fingers or a beauty sponge. Don't use normal sponges. Blend it down the neck too and make sure the foundation matches your skin tone. Don't use a darker/lighter one.

, Load the blush on a brush, shake off the excess, then put it on the apples of the cheeks (the area where you normally blush) and blend (if it's in a gel form, put a dot on the cheeks and blend with a kabuki brush (a type of brush)). For bronzer, put it in the areas where the sun normally hits. (Make a three form, starting from the sides of the forehead, to the part below the apples (the cheekbone) and down the chin). You can also contour your nose.

, It can be in any shade,ranging from nudes to vampy reds. You choose! If you wish,you can apply lip gloss,too! Try to put it in the center, to create the full lips effect. Only stay within your lips, don't overdraw them or you'll look like a clown.

",How to Have a 13th Birthday Sleepover Party for Girls," You might want to invite a few of your closest friends, (best friends) or you may wish to invite more girls. Remember not to leave anyone out just to be mean. However, if there is someone who you really don't want to invite, don't invite them, even if they are expecting an invitation. They could ruin your party. Be sure you have enough space for the amount of people you are inviting.;
, For smaller groups, you may be able to do something like going out to eat, going to a movie, or going shopping at the mall or arcade. This is hard for large groups, however, because it gets expensive and you will have to carpool (if you still want to do this, use the public transit). It's also fun to pick a theme that you can do at home, like


Movie night
Your favorite color
Spa Theme
A time period (such as Ancient Rome or the 70's)
A popular television show (such as Survivor or MTV)
A spa party

A country (such as France or Japan).

, Add the theme details to the invitations so your friends know what to expect. It's fun to hand them out at school, but your friends might lose them, and other people who aren't invited may get mad. Basically, it's best to mail them or email them out.


Either make invitations yourself, or buy ones from a store which are really pretty and simple or reflect your theme. You could also use free invitation websites such as Evite to create your invitations.
Be sure to send invitations at least three weeks before the event so no one has anything planned. If you will be really bummed if a couple of best friends can't make it; plan a date with them in advance.
Make sure you include the major details on your invite, such as date, time, place, how they will get home, theme, and what to bring.

, You will probably want to serve dinner, but you don't have to. Just don't start the party at five and expect guests to have already eaten. If you are going out to eat, dinner is already taken care of. If not, either serve something simple and yummy, like pizza, Chinese food, or sushi.


To make sure that everyone is happy, ask what type of food your guests like.
Make sure to have a great dessert; either cake, cupcakes, ice cream -sundaes-, cannoli, tiramisu, crème brûlée, pie, brownies, and/or a chocolate fountain.
If you're buying a cake, order it from a specialty bakery, as these cakes are amazing. However, you could just get one from a grocery store.
Don't forget drinks! Serve soda, juice, water, and/or milk. If you want, have a 'float bar' with different sodas (Coke, root beer, Sprite, cream soda, etc.) and different flavours of ice cream so your friends can make their own floats.
For breakfast, serve a classic like French toast, or pancakes with bacon or sausage. You could also try muffins.

, Most importantly, set aside a large area for sleeping bags. A good spot is a family room or living room because you can push the couches and tables to the side and have a big wide open space. Then you can sleep on the couch, too. Decorate with balloons and streamers in your favourite colours, and coloured lights if possible.


Why not make your own decorations as well? You could make posters or draw things to stick up.

, If you're going out somewhere, this will take up most of the time at night, but you should still have a few activity ideas for when guests arrive and for the morning. You could watch movies (no horror films late at night. Romantic comedies are your best bets for a group of girls). Maybe play Truth or Dare and Would You Rather.

, Go shopping and get at least one new item to wear, or get a whole outfit (this could be one of your birthday presents). Make sure to wear something flattering, so you'll look good in pictures, and fashionable, so you'll stand out.

, It should be a large area that can hold everyone and allow for lots of movement.

Show your parents you are responsible.,
Pick a time to talk.,
Focus on the present situation.,
Share the necessary details of the event.,
Ask why if your parents say no.",How to Get Your Parents to Let You Go to a Sleepover1," You'll want to do a bit of prep work before discussing a sleepover with your parents. Sometimes, a ""show don't tell"" approach works best. Consider spending a few days showing your parents you're responsible. If your parents see you're maturing, they might be more willing to allow you to have extra freedom.


Most parents expect that kids will reach a point where they crave more independence. However, understand parents have worries themselves. They will want to make sure they know where you are at all times. You can ease some of their potential anxiety by showcasing your growing maturity and independence.
Do your chores without being asked.
Complete your homework as soon as you get home from school.
Be upfront about what's happening in your day-to-day life by sharing details about school and your social life without prompting.
Use ""please"" and ""thank you"" at the dinner table.;
, After showing your parents your increasing maturity, pick a time to talk about the sleepover. Choose a time that's flexible and works for both you and your parents. That is, don't bring up the issue at 11 o'clock at night when you know your parents have to be up for work in the morning. Instead, bring it up a little after dinner on a weeknight.Try to be as mature as possible when bringing up the subject. Say something courteous like, ""Mom, Dad, I wanted to talk to you about something that's been on my mind.""
Remember your manners as this will impress your parents. Try something like, ""Could we please have a talk after dinner tonight?""

, Your parents may react negatively if you bring up other people's families, your friends, or your siblings. Keep your focus on yourself and your situation.


You may be tempted to say something like, ""Miranda's parents are letting her go!"" or ""You let Jamie go to sleepover's when he was my age."" Such statements are likely to rub your parents the wrong way. It's irrelevant what other people are doing. Your parents have made rules with your specific needs and safety in mind.Talk about yourself and the reasons you are mature enough to attend a sleepover. Point to things like your grades and your behavior. Say something like, ""I usually get decent grades and I stay out of trouble. I feel like you should have some trust in me."" You can also explain to your parents why you want to go to the sleepover. Try something like, ""I really like hanging out with Sophie and her friends at school. I feel like it would be a lot of fun hanging out with them outside of the classroom and this is a good opportunity."", Parents usually want to know where you are, what you're doing, and who you're with. Withholding this information could make your parents less likely to grant you permission to attend a sleepover. Be upfront about where the sleepover is, who will be there, and what events and activities will take place. Your parents will feel a lot more comfortable granting you permission if they know exactly what's going on., If your parents still say ""No,"" it can be helpful for you to ask them why. Try not to yell or get frustrated as this can result in an argument. Instead, ask what their main concerns are. Wait a few days until you've both cooled down and you've had time to figure out how to address these concerns. Then, bring the event up again and see if the discussion goes over any better."

Point out the benefits of sleepovers.,
Compromise.,
Talk about your medical concerns.,
Provide contact details.",How to Get Your Parents to Let You Go to a Sleepover2," Your parents may not realize sleepovers can be important when it comes to growth and development. Explain to your parents the potential benefits in allowing you to attend a sleepover.


Sleepovers build confidence. They force you out of your regular comfort zone and allow you to experience customs different than your own. A sleepover is also a practice in manners and respect. You'll have to learn to be courteous of the rules and regulations of another person's home. Attending a sleepover can help you learn to be a good guest. Say something like, ""I think it would be good for me to experience new things. A sleepover can teach me to be a good guest.""Sleepovers allow kids to build social skills. Interacting with other children or teens your age is important to your growth. It also teaches more independence as you'll be able to experience things outside the context of your parents' home. Say something like, ""I love spending time with you guys, but I'd like to have spend time with people my own age as well."", It can sometimes help to compromise if you want to convince your parents to say ""yes."" For example, you can agree to call or text your parents every few hours to let them know you're okay. This might make them feel safer about allowing you to go as they'll have occasional assurance that you're okay., If you have a serious allergy, illness, or chronic condition that requires treatment, like asthma, bring up this topic before your parents do. Tell them how you plan to address such concerns at a slumber party.


Answering objections before parents bring them up can be the difference between “yes” and “no.” Countering potential arguments is a powerful in any negotiation and your talk with your parents is no different.Role playing what you might do in a situation your parents fear can make them more relaxed.An example of this might look like:

Son: So, I'm a little worried about if I eat peanuts.
Dad: Me too. You've had some bad allergic reactions in the past. What will you do if that happens?
Son: Well, I've packed my EpiPen in my overnight bag and I told his mom I'm allergic, so I think I'll be OK.



, Your parents will likely be concerned about where you'll be. Provide contact information for the parents hosting the sleepover. If you provide information about where you'll be and how to contact you in the event of an emergency, your parents will be more likely to allow you to attend."

This can help put them in a good mood., If you find that your parents are usually in a good mood in the morning, try to ask them after breakfast. Their after-breakfast mood will be more agreeable.If your parents are more active during the evening, aim for after dinner., A few days before asking your parents about going to the sleepover, ask them for something else you want but know they won't let you have. Say, ask them if you can adopt a dog from the animal shelter or have your own car. A few days later, when you're ready to ask your parents for the sleepover, they will be more likely to make this small concession after refusing your other, bigger request., By putting what your parents have told you in your own words and repeating it back to them, you will show your parents that you understand what they're saying and how they feel. This will help your chances of having a sleepover and changing your parents' minds. Your parents will see you're mature enough to try to listen to and understand their point of view."

Write down a list of their interests.,
Do something that's meaningful for them.,
Determine if the person enjoys privacy or likes grand gestures.",How to Ask a Girl to Prom or Homecoming in a Cute Way3," Knowing what kinds of things that your prom date likes doing will let you cater your proposal to their tastes and interests. Write down a list of what they like to do, including what their hobbies are, any sports or activities they are involved in, and the kind of music that they like. Try to incorporate one or more of these things into your proposal for homecoming or prom.


For instance, if the person you're asking out is really into tennis, you can spell out your proposal using tennis balls., Think of the person's personality and what touches them or gets them invested emotionally. This could be a specific song, photo imagery, or something that they have experienced in the past. Try to weave that into your proposal so that it has the most emotional impact.


For instance, if you know they have a favorite romantic song, you can create a dance and singing routine covering the song.
If you've taken pictures with your date, you can include them in a scavenger hunt for your proposal.
If you both like a quote or a line from a book, try to integrate that into your proposal.

, Some people don't like grand public gestures and are easily embarrassed. If your date has this kind of personality, doing something public and romantic might turn them off. In this case, you should ask them in a private setting. If your date enjoys showing off their affection, a grand or public proposal might be the better route.

Even though you probably won't need all that many, it's always good to pack more than you think you need.;
, If your friend has already had her period, she'll probably have supplies. If she has not gotten hers yet, it might be more awkward, but depending on your friendship, you might still confide in her. Also, the host's mom may have tampons or pads if you ask her.

, Sometimes wearing tighter jeans makes you feel uncomfortable, so wear what suits you on your period. Sometimes a long shirt can make you feel more secure about it, too.

, If you have menstrual cramps make sure to pack some Advil, Tylenol, or whatever works best for you so you can make sure to feel comfortable and have a good time.

, You probably will not have an accident or a heavy flow, but make sure to take a shower before you go, and even at the sleepover to avoid smelling or chafing.

, This works fine, unless your flow is heavy enough that you're going to bleed after you flush.

Don't flush your tampons or pads! They will clog the toilet, and that wouldn't be fun. Also, your secret will be out! Simply dispose it in the trash can.

To dispose of your tampons or pads, wrap them up in the wrapper from the new one you have put in. You can wrap it in toilet paper and dispose it in the trash. If you feel nervous putting them in someone else's garbage bin, bring a plastic bag with you and put them in it. Hide it with your stuff to throw away when you get back home.

Wash your hands. There are germs, so make sure no parts of your body may get infected just because you didn't wash your hands.

When you leave the bathroom, take a quick look around to make sure there isn't any blood on the floor or toilet seat. If there is, clean it with toilet paper.


, It's always a good idea to tell your best friends mom or even your best friend if they have gotten their period so they could tell you if you leak through your clothes or even if you bled onto the floor in the bathroom without noticing."

Plan your slumber party.,
Play board and card games.,
Have crazy makeovers.,
Have a fashion show.,
Dish up weird snacks.,
Play prank calls on people.,
Play charades.,
Play hide and seek.,
Be flexible.",How to Entertain at Slumber Parties," Make a list of ideas and themes for your party. Ask your friends for suggestions, and attempt to combine all of your ideas together. However, be flexible and avoid planning an exact schedule, as it may change depending on how fun the activities are.;
, Offer some well-known ones for a classic pastime. You could also look up new games to try out with your friends. Be sure that everyone is able to participate; otherwise, some people may feel left out.

, Rather than dolling your friends up, have them dress each other in crazy fashions. You could also have makeovers where your friends are unaware of how you're dressing them. Be creative when giving makeovers.

, However, instead of creating classic and cute outfits, plan out weird ones. Dig out old clothes and let your friends try them on. You could also make dresses out of trash bags and other strange materials. Allow your imagination to go wild.

, Allow your friends to have full reign of your kitchen. Have them mix together as many foods as they want for strange combinations. Feed them to a blindfolded person for fun. However, beware when eating your strange concoctions, as it may result in sickness.

, Dig out unknown numbers from your phones, or call up a friend. Create strange surveys for your victims to take, or pretend to be a long-lost relative. However, avoid scaring people too much, and make sure that they know it was a prank call before hanging up.

, Do impressions of your classmates, and have your friends guess who you're imitating.

, This is a classic, fun game that never gets old, no matter how old you are. Add new rules to the game for fun.

, Allow yourself to relax and have fun with your friends. Keep your slumber party as unorganized as possible; otherwise, it will fail. By allowing your friends to be free and express who they are at your party, you'll be sure to have a blast.

Be considerate of her feelings.,
Do some makeovers.,
If your friend is okay with it, do a couple of innocent prank calls.,
Play a classic sleepover game.,
Show her some of your favourite videos on YouTube.,
Watch some movies.",How to Do Classic Sleepover Activities with Your Shy Friend," If she is really uncomfortable with certain sleepover activities, then don't push her! Also, you may want to change the rules of some of the games so that she is more comfortable with doing them. For example, if you are playing Truth or Dare, the rules might be that you can't dare the other person to do anything really embarrassing in public, you can't ask super personal questions, and if you really are uncomfortable with doing a certain dare or answering a certain question, then you can skip it with no consequences whatsoever. This way she may be less reluctant to play and may end up enjoying herself!;
, If your friend is skeptical about this as well, then only do certain parts of the makeover. For example, instead of doing your friend's makeup, doing her nails, doing her hair, AND giving her a new outfit to wear, do only 1 or 2 of these things. Also, check if she is interested in anything to do with fashion. Does she do her nails often? Then give each other a manicure and/or pedicure. Does she seem to work on her hair a lot? Give her a new hairstyle to try out and let her do your hair next. Does she seem to love dressing up? Let her try on some of your clothes and have her give you an outfit to wear. You get the idea. Also, if your friend seems to think that makeovers are boring, try to make them exciting. For example, if you are doing facial masks, while you let the masks set, read some magazines or watch some TV or, if you have your eyes covered, set up a playlist and listen to music or simply talk.

, It's probably best if you do the prank call on somebody that you know. If you prank call someone you know, as long as you tell them that it's and your friend who are calling, then it's a lot safer and easier to convince your friend that it's safe to prank call and that the other person won't be offended if you prank call them. If your friend really doesn't want to do this then stop right now and don't do the call. If she decides to do it or is still a little bit uneasy about doing this, explain how you will do the call after reading these general rules to make sure that the prank call won't get you in (as much) trouble. Make sure that you say something random instead of 100% creepy (for example, say ""Guess what? You are a person."" instead of, ""I'm going to come over and stalk you."") and then say your name and, if your friend decides to join in the call, say her name too. So, the prank call could go something like this: ""This is Lacy and her awesome friend Rita. Guess what? You live in a house/apartment."" After you finish the call, hang up if you don't want to hear the person's reaction, or don't hang up until the person has reacted/hung up themselves. Before doing this however, remember that even if the call is harmless you might still get in trouble.

, Try a pillow fight or flashlight tag either outside or inside in a big room with nothing to break. If your friend would rather do something a little less rambunctious, try Truth or Dare (without rowdy dares) or Would You Rather? These games can get a little rowdy, but not with certain rules and the proper attitude. You can also try MASH (the MASH app for Android and iPod is also good because it mixes Mad Libs with MASH).

, This isn't necessarily a classic, but it's still something that you can do at a sleepover.

, This is something that pretty much everyone does. Even shy girls enjoy movies. If your friend isn't into ""mainstream"" movies like Twilight, Harry Potter, and The Hunger Games, ask her about other movies to watch. For romantic comedies, try watching You've Got Mail or Groundhog Day. Also, if you like movies that are a bit creepy but not filled with horror, try movies like Coraline, Paranorman, and Frankenweenie. Ask your friend about some of her favourite movie and consider your own tastes to select some other movies.

Ask your parents to speak to the other parents.,
Try a few trial runs of being at that friends house at night.,
Wait before you're more experienced with sleeping away from home.",How to Beat Homesickness at a Sleepover1," Letting them know that you are new to sleepovers and may not make it through the night will give them a chance to coordinate a plan should that happen. (You shouldn't lie about it. Parents will see through that so it is just easier to have a plan upfront.) Knowing you aren't stuck and that there is a Plan B should help you relax. The other parents will also know to look out for you and may even ask if you'd like to go home before everyone turns in for bed. It's better to tell them upfront than to wake the whole house to leave at 3 AM.;
, Have your parents pick you up before or after bedtime.

, You may wish to get used to sleeping away from home by spending the night at a grandparents', aunt/uncle's, or friend's house where you know you're with family. It's usually easier if you know the parents and other kids at the house too.

Ask if they could come up to the door with you so that you can say goodnight.

, If you are staying with friends while your parents are out of town, if there are events planned such as church or a school function, you will be more comfortable having your own clothes.

, Don't bring a lot of toys but you should bring things that make you comfortable.

Don't mope around.,
Try not to think about home when it is time to go to bed.,
Keep an open mind.,
Just remember, you will see your parent/guardian soon!",How to Beat Homesickness at a Sleepover3," Have fun! It helps a lot when you get to the sleepover.

, Most likely, you will be tired anyway, and won't have the energy to think! Also, try not to think about home much during the sleepover, and if you find yourself really missing home, you could always just call home and ask to come home. You may not be quite ready for a sleepover yet.

, Every house runs a little differently and your friends routine may be different. This can be chores before bedtime, helping with siblings in the morning before school or going to church or other function. Ask about their schedule before so you can pack for it.

, Try to forget that they aren't there. Imagine they are in the next room, and they move out of the room when you go in there.

"
"
Try turning the TV on with low volume so you don't wake the host, if you honestly can't get to sleep, and are really homesick.

,
Tell the host, and ask if you can call home if you can't get over your homesickness.,
If you can just try to push through, making it through the night will give you the feeling that you can do it, and may cure your homesickness.

,
Remember to pick up after yourself and don't scream and yell.,
Focus on what you're going to do the next day.",How to Beat Homesickness at a Sleepover4,", This step could be embarrassing, so it is alright to say you don't feel good. It always feels good to talk to a parent once or twice before the sleepover settles down.

,, Be very polite and offer to help out when you can. If you do, the parents will appreciate your politeness and you will be welcomed back.

, Don't think that you're not going to sleep. Focus on tomorrow instead.

Also make sure that your parent(s) like your friend and know them.",How to Convince Your Mom to Let You Have a Sleepover,";
, Find out what their issues are. See if you can work around them.

, Even if the sleep over is for your birthday, do it on a Saturday to Sunday because it's the best time. This way you are hopefully not disturbing your parents when they have to go to work.

, Don't plan on inviting loads of people. A couple of friends is a good number.

, If you are old enough, drink responsibly.

, If you want to play games, do it earlier on in the night, not at 2 o'clock in the morning.

, You might appreciate it one day.

, If they know what you want to do, they won't be so apprehensive about what you're planning to get up to.

, If they don't like your friend and you ask beforehand, in case your mum and dad says ""yes"", make sure to tell your friend to behave around the house and to not make too much noise.

Consider where you will be.,
Look at how easily you can serve the snacks.,
Make sure your friends don't have dietary restrictions.,
Think about the theme of the party.,
Watch out for caffeine.,
Search for creative recipes.,
Ask your friends for ideas.,
Read the ingredients if your friends have dietary restrictions.,
Get some crunchy, salty snacks.,
Try out some sweets.,
Throw some healthier foods in the mix.,
Try making some snacks during the party.,
Pick out meal foods.,
Don't forget the drinks.,
Think about breakfast.",How to Choose Snacks for a Sleepover," The location of your sleepover can affect a great deal of what you can and can't choose for snacks. You'll need to consider the temperature of the area, as well as the surroundings - a cold night might not be the best night for frozen yogurt!

If you'll be on carpeting or rugs, you might want to avoid snacks that would be messy if spilled, such as nachos or ice cream. Similarly, you'll want to avoid foods or drinks that will stain if spilled.
If you're outside in warm weather, you'll want to avoid things that will attract bees and wasps (such as sodas), and food that will melt too quickly to be enjoyed. You may also need to cover foods so that bugs don't infiltrate them.;
, Some snacks require being kept in certain temperatures, while others need to be stored in a certain way, and still others can just be hard to serve (such as small unwrapped candies). If you need to go to great lengths to keep the snacks edible, then it may be more effort than it's worth to have the snack available in the first place.

Using coolers or small bowls given to individual guests can be of great use when having treats that can be tough to store or serve.

, Some people can't eat certain foods for whatever reason - some common causes are allergies, food intolerances, being vegetarian or vegan, or sensitivity to certain foods (such as spicy foods). Ask your guests if there's anything they can't eat, and write it down to make sure you remember., If your party follows a certain theme, having your snacks stick to that theme will keep the guests more entranced in the theme. This doesn't mean that the snacks you wanted can't be at your party - just find ways to make them match the theme. Try looking up ideas for themed party snacks.

For example, if you're having a Harry Potter sleepover, you could have Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, chocolate frogs, butterbeer, pumpkin juice, and other foods that remind the partygoers of Harry Potter.

, It's known that nobody expects to get much sleep, if any, at a sleepover, but you shouldn't overload yourself or your guests on caffeine at the sleepover. Doing so can result in the guests getting too hyper (which can result in broken household objects) and then having a ""crash"" later, where you get tired suddenly, and possibly grumpy. If you're too hyper, as well, you may end up waking up your parents in the middle of the night!

Caffeine is in things like coffee, soda, and chocolate, as well as energy drinks. While you may not want to avoid all of these, don't have a lot of them, either.

, Lots of classic sleepover snacks can have a neat twist put on them to make them more exciting, or new recipes can pop up that you'd never even thought of. Try looking in cookbooks or searching online for sleepover recipes. Pinterest, for example, has masses of creative snack recipes for sleepovers, even themed ones., If you can't find anything suitable, don't have a theme to follow, and are completely stumped, try checking with the partygoers on what they'd want or what some good foods to bring would be. You can even try having everyone bring a snack of their choice, or some other similar idea.

For example, you can ask, ""I wanted to get some snacks for the sleepover, but I don't know what I should get. Is there something in particular that you want or that you think everyone else would enjoy?""
If you have friends with dietary restrictions, be sure to ask them for ideas if their dietary restriction may rule out a lot of foods for them (e.g. they're vegan).

, If you're buying snacks for your party and your friends can't eat something, you'll need to make sure that the foods you're buying don't have the ingredients that your friends can't eat. Look at the nutrition information on the packaging and read the ingredients before buying it.

If you really want to have food that contains something that one of your friends can't eat, you may want to label it by putting a Post-It note on a bowl or bag of the food saying ""Contains peanuts"" or ""Has lactose"".
Make sure that there's a good variety for your friends with dietary restrictions to pick from - don't just get one snack that they can eat and nothing else.
If you're making food at home, you'll need to be very careful to make sure the ingredients you're using are safe and that nothing cross-contaminates.

, Many sleepover attendees will enjoy a salty snack during a sleepover, and it's a good change of pace from the normal batch of sweets that some may not want to overindulge on. Some examples of salty snacks you could have are:

Chips (such as potato chips or tortilla chips)

Popcorn (try putting some twists on it)
Hard pretzels
Crackers (try pairing them with peanut butter or cheese)

, Sugary food is often a staple of sleepovers, and are sure to be a hit if your attendees enjoy sugar. Try out classic sleepover staples like:

Ice cream or frozen yogurt
Gummy treats (such as gummy worms or gummy bears)
Rice Krispie treats
Baked goods (such as brownies or cupcakes)

, If the attendees aren't huge fans of junk foods and sugar, don't panic - there are still some options out there. These include:

Vegetable trays

Fruit salad or fruit kabobs

Yogurt parfaits
Traditional ""healthy"" snacks, such as celery and peanut butter

, A favorite sleepover experience is to work with the attendees to make treats, and then enjoy the treats together. Some quick treats (and some sleepover classics!) could be:

Eggless cookie dough
Quick dips, such as bean dip, nacho dip, or avocado dip

Drinks such as hot chocolate (maybe with Oreos) or root beer floats
S'mores

, If your guests won't be eating dinner at the party, but you know the snacks won't be filling enough, small meal foods can be great ""snacks"" and satisfy your friends while still leaving room for the actual snacks. Some small meal-type foods are great choices for sleepovers!

Pizza is a classic choice for sleepovers; try mini pizzas or pizza bites.
Hamburger sliders are small, delicious treats for when you don't want to make whole burgers.
Large soft pretzels are good choices for nibbling on.
Mini tacos can be a delight for those who want a quick meal.

, Nobody wants to be thirsty during a sleepover! Pair your snacks with a drink that matches well, such as:

Soda
Lemonade
Hot chocolate
Fruit juice
Keep water available for those who want it.

, While snacks typically aren't associated with breakfast, a good option for breakfast is to set up a ""breakfast bar"" so that people can take foods that they'd like. Try miniature pancakes or waffles, bagels, mini strips of bacon (try turkey bacon for those who can't eat pork), various fruits, or just miniature boxes of cereal and milk. Giving everyone the opportunity to pick the foods they want can allow for a more ""snack""-type breakfast."

Respond to the slumber party invitation.,
Don't prepare to put much time into wishing people you may not like to not be there.,

Ask the host what the plan is, if a fire emergency arises during the slumber party/sleepover.,
Locate an acceptable spot on the floor that seems fit for you and your blanket sleeper.,
Plan on changing into your blanket sleeper when you first arrive.,
Stay the entire night.",How to Attend an Adult Blanket Sleeper‐Themed Slumber Party," Unless you have a really good explanation as to why you can't go (not just that you aren't courageous yet to show off your cool blanket sleeper to your friends), consider going to that party! Write a response to the host. Whether directly on a sheet of paper sent via postal mail (snail mail) or on an electronic communication (email) or even a message left over an answering machine or voicemail mailbox, communicate with the host that you'll be attending their party.;
, People who reflect poorly on you during their day, may end up being an lifesaver at night (should something happen)! Go with the flow!

, Though many superstores like Walmart and Target tend to sell blanket sleepers often, you will often need to turn to shopping in the non-peak months for the sleeper or shopping online for one instead.

, You'll need at least the one sleeper as you enter through the host family's door, but two are highly encouraged (in the case of accidents). One sleeper is always the bare minimum amount you'll need when you attend a party like this themed one is.


Allow the blanket sleeper to be brought home, whether through mail (for online purchases) or via a transportation mode for other offline purchases.

, Whether these gifts are in the form of food for your friends and you, or are of other miscellaneous themes, make each one of these gifts unique in their own way.

, Blanket sleepers are warm enough to wear during the winter, and assuming modifications can be met can be cool enough for summer-use too. Bringing an additional blanket isn't recommended.

, It'll take a bit more courage to wear something you aren't fully courageous enough to wear publicly, but once you get to know and accept these facts, you'll want to wear them everywhere you go! Sometimes, you'll never want to take them off (not even for a second).

, Let these family members know that at least one of their uninvited members must also wear a blanket sleeper of some sort, though wearing a blanket sleeper for the adult isn't required but is suggested to keep with the same theme of the party.


Members between the ages of 5 months to 6 or 7 years, must wear some sort of disposable pant (whether that be a disposable diaper, a disposable potty training pant (regardless of whether or not they are potty trained or not), or a disposable bedwetting diaper), accidents do occur. Before things show up in the laundry, it's best to protect and cover up with one or two during the night either way.A disposable pant must be worn by all children who attend.
Also realize, that if uninvited children can attend, they must be supervised by an additional parent at all times! (However, the parent doesn't have to wear a blanket sleeper, but is highly encouraged to wear one!)


You the invitee, and anyone else over the minimum age for the party children, are not exempt from not wearing a blanket sleeper (as that is the theme of this slumber party).


Contact the host's family to ensure that this party has been planned and accepted by the host's parents. Some of the parents of the party may not even realize that it is standard fare to allow these others into the host's house.

, Don't be late, as late-comers will need to still comply with the other rules and possible little chance to find a good parking space.

, Even if you as much as suspect an unintended animal may be nearby that you are allergic to, it's best to tell the family of your allergies.

, Every host house should have some sort of plan, though few are ever in written form.

, Keep the locations of your friends in mind, but be careful as not to step on anyone as you move around the floor.


Keep the route to the restrooms in mind, if you tend to warrant stress not too well or have stomach symptoms caused by stress.







, While you can wear it when you walk up to the host's door, you don't have to. Just make sure that a few minutes can be used shortly after to change into it after arriving inside the door to their house/apartment.

, Although some may criticize you for dressing differently, once they become less churlish and see how they themselves feel when they too wear ones, they'll see why you have began to re-enjoy them after a period of non-use. They will stopbothering you and accept your appearance that night, should they too feel the need to get up and use the facilities (or other issues).

Thank the host's kids and host's parents for having you at the sleepover.",How to Attend a Sleepover when You Know That You Wet the Bed," It's embarrassing to wet your bed, but there's no use crying over the situation. If you make a few adjustments to prevent an accident during the sleepover, you can get attend it without worry. You may feel embarrassed, but even at age eleven twelve or thirteen, lots of kids still wet the bed., Hosts who are true friends of yours should be able to keep your secret and won't make you feel ashamed. If you're not sure you trust them, you may have to be more discrete or have your parents discuss the issues with their parents, rather than looping them in.

If you respond to the host soon after you get the sleepover invitation, you can always decline without telling them why.
Bedwetting can be linked in with medical conditions that can affect people of all sorts. Just like some people can't see without glasses and some people can't get around without a wheelchair, some people have trouble with urinary control. A true friend will understand and accept that it's an unintentional medical issue. Sometimes people may have sensitive bladders or even just sleep really still and don't wake up when their bladder tells them to

, If you are attending, get in contact with the host and let them know, by whatever means they prefer. You don't have to mention that you have bedwetting issues at this stage., Getting into a routine before the sleepover will help you get used to it. Have your parents help you choose a reliable prevention method. You might use bedwetting diapers, bedwetting pads, or any of the other bedwetting protection products available.

It's inevitable that you'll need some help learning the ropes with any of these, and your parent's advice can be valuable. You may be hesitant to wear a protective garment like bedwetting diapers, but you may also find it comforting to know you won't have a visible accident.

, Get used to your protection methods any time you either take a nap or go to bed. Even if you plan to wake soon, practicing with their use can help you feel ready for the sleepover.

Make sure you have some back-up packs of diapers and/or bedwetting pads. You'll want enough for emergencies and so that you can practice wearing them before the sleepover.
Use nighttime-specific/bedwetting diapers (not training pants or similar lighter diapers), to make sure they can hold the result of an accident all night and that they fit you well when you wear them.
Place a new disposable bed pad on the bed. You may want to purchase more than one pack for extra coverage. The most common bed mats sold for bedwetting are called Goodnites Bed Mats and are available at most supermarkets and all online retailers.
You may also need a waterproof mattress cover so any overflowing urine won't make it onto the mattress. You can find these at various retailers including Toys 'R' Us. If possible and practical, you may want to use a cover at your host's house too, but the feasibility of this may depend on where you're sleeping and what you're willing to tell them about your bedwetting.

, You may choose to keep your bedwetting diaper packages out and visible at first so you don't forget them.

Have your parents check on your supplies every few days to make sure you don't run out. It's better to be prepared for an emergency than to run out. As long as you have some emergency and back-up supplies, you should be fine.
Set up your changing routine so changes can be quick and easy. Open your disposable bedwetting diaper packages properly, so that it's easy to grab a fresh diaper quickly.
Use a fresh diaper each night. Used diapers should be thrown away regardless of whether or not you had an accident in them.

, At the sleepover, it'll be up to you to clean up and dispose of your trash properly. Wet disposable bedwetting diapers should be bagged and thrown away, ideally in a garbage can with a lid., Track your daily use of diapers and discuss with your family how you can tackle problems you may encounter. Make sure you know how to change your own bedwetting diapers at the sleepover, and get help practicing if needed., Make sure that you pack more than one disposable bedwetting diaper to ensure that you don't have any protection problem accidents during the night, along with at least two sets of clean clothes.

Pack a bed mat or two on the bottom to cushion the backpack and clothes and keep things clean. Be sure to pack a few plastic grocery bags too, for used diapers and so you can bring home any wet clothes to wash and dry.

, Have them explain that you wet the bed, but that you are trained to handle your own accidents and can do things on your own. Make sure they know you have a system so they realize you won't damage the mattress. Some parents may need reassurance that you'll have the supplies you need and they won't be responsible for cleaning up., If your bedwetting is related to medical issues, you may have medications you need to take. Take your medications before you leave your house, or bring them with you in your backpack., These help minimize the sound of the diaper ruffling every time you move around on the bed. You can always put on a clean pair of underwear over top of the diaper if you want to feel more protected, too, but this may make some noise against your diaper., Do a dry run of diapering yourself within a few hours of the sleepover, but have your parents nearby to ensure they don't spot potential problems that can be easily avoided. This will help you feel more confident that you can handle the changing alone., You may want to change out of your day clothes and into your nightwear prior to even being transported to the event, if it suits the activities planned., If your parents have already let the host parents know about your plan, there's really no big need to draw more attention to it. If you prefer, you can tell them that you have accidents in your bed, but that you have measures in place to protect the bed., Bedwetting is natural. You can be discrete about your habits, but your host or any of the other sleepover invitees may realize that you're wearing diapers or using bedwetting pads. You don't have to be ashamed. If asked, just tell them, ""It doesn't happen much, but I wanted to be safe."" You're entitled to your privacy, and you don't have to explain any more than you want to.

If the parents corner you and ask you about your bedwetting problem, talk to them in private over on the side when their kids aren't in earshot range. The parents may just need to be reassured that you can handle your problems yourself, so they may check in with you. Just explain that you have it under control. Don't be shy or ashamed.
Say as much or as little as you want to say about it. Determine if you can divulge your secrets to the host family's kids. Don't be shy or ashamed, but just tell them what you want to tell them. It's easy enough to be fairly discrete about your underwear and bathroom habits.

, Look for a place you can drop off your backpack. The parents will most often help you set up the bed, if you tell them that you brought along a mattress pad. If possible, do this during a quiet moment before everyone else gets ready for bed, so it's all set up ahead of time. Ask the parents for help if needed., Use the disposable products that you packed to help protect the bed. If you're not already in your bedwetting diaper, bring it to the bathroom discretely and put it on. Do the same routine you should be used to doing at home., You can use this to hold your trash after you change., The diaper and bed mat may protect your body and the bed, but no piece of clothing is foolproof, no matter what it claims. Keep some spare supplies and clothes nearby for a quick change if needed.

If your bedwetting is severe, you might want to choose to double-diaper yourself. However, for most bedwetters, double-diapering isn't needed.

, Don't wake everyone else up; just quietly take care of business., Do this as part of your normal dressing routine.

If you have time before the host family's kid awakens, you might be able to slip into the bathroom and change yourself out of the diaper, early. However, if the host family's kids are awake and you want to be discrete, you may prefer to delay your clothing change.
If you don't have enough time to change when you wake up, you may end up having to change your clothes once you are back at home. However, if you did have an accident, your diaper may smell, so changing right away is preferable.

, Even if they say it's okay to put the dirty ones in a trash can, try to take them back home with you when you leave. Use your own plastic bag and dispose of your trash at home so that you don't leave any smelly disposables in their trash., Throw into the plastic supermarket bag all of your used bedwetting diapers, and put this bag into your backpack for you to take home., Say good bye however you usually would, and let them know you had a great time."

Use a good quality tent; this isn't the time for the beach shade. It must be a tent you'd really camp in, to protect you from the rain, bugs, and wind.;
, Put something soft on the floor to lie on: camping cots, a blow-up air mattress, yoga mats, a thick comforter, or even couch cushions work well. Add pillows and lightweight sleeping bags or cotton blankets for summer warmth, especially if you live where the night temperatures dip considerably., Add soft toys or stuffed animals for the kids. Put a few flashlights, lanterns, or glow sticks in each tent as well. You can also set out decks of cards or board games in case it gets chilly., If you have a picnic table or a patio set, that would work best. Otherwise, set up a few lawn chairs and a small table to set out drinks and food. A low-maintenance option is to lay out a blanket in the sun, so that your friends can relax, eat, and chat. Be sure the grass isn't wet!


Before laying out the seating area, do a sweep for doggy do-do, ant hills, prickles, or other irritants and nasties that might spoil the experience.

, Mosquito bites will surely put a damper on the fun, so be sure to get plenty of bug repellant for you and your guests.You could also use a bug zapper or light citronella candles or tiki torches filled with citronella to keep pesky bugs away.


Ensure your children know not to touch or play with bug zappers, citronella candles, or tiki torches. Even bug spray can be dangerous if ingested or sprayed in the eyes. Make sure an adult supervises or applies the products for children.

, You could prepare something ahead of time, or even order out. Pizza is a good option, if you are with a large group of people. Have a few bags of chips, or other snack items set out, as well as a cooler full of ice with a variety of drinks. For hot summer afternoons consider making homemade treats, including:


Pizza
Hot dogs
Fries
Popcorn
Lemonade
Chocolate chip cookies

, A warm fire is a camping classic. Just be sure you have municipal permission (if you are a child, you must have adult supervision) and keep a close eye on your bonfire. Remember to follow all fire safety precautions, keep a hose or fire extinguisher handy, and never leave the bonfire unattended.


If your space doesn’t allow for a bonfire, consider using a terracotta pot as a fire pit. Line your pot with aluminum foil, fill it with charcoal, and light it up.This will allow you to roast s’mores or other items, giving you that true camping feel. Just remember to keep a hose or fire extinguisher handy, and never leave your fire pit unattended.
Make sure children are supervised by adults when near any open flame. Consider drawing a circle around your bonfire or firepit, and teach children not to cross the line.

, Besides keeping warm, you can also roast marshmallows or hot dogs on your campfire. It is also a great place to just cozy up and stare at the flames.


You could ask children to point out shapes in the flames or coals and see where their imaginations take them (similar to finding shapes in clouds).
The campfire is also a great location for group activities such as telling stories or singing songs., Cut a circle out of a pizza box and use it as a template to spray different colored circles on your lawn.You’ll need four to six different colors to make rows of four to six circles each, each row having its own color.


Use a spinner from the game itself, or make your own with paper and markers. Someone could even call out the colors and body parts at random (e.g., right foot blue, left hand yellow, etc.).
Use contractor’s marking spray paint if you want to easily wash away the paint after your camp out.

, Make a list of items likely to be found in the yard and hand out copies to everyone who wants to play. This game works well individually and in teams. You can see who can find the most items, or who can find items the fastest. Consider handing out a small prize to the winner(s), such as glow sticks or candy.


A few ideas for your list include: a four-leaf clover, a ladybug, something yellow, two identical leaves, a feather, a round rock, etc.

, Bring a stereo or boombox outside, or even plug your phone into a compatible projection speaker. Music will liven up your camp-out in no time. Take turns being the DJ so everyone gets to hear their favorite tunes. You can even start a dance party!


If you have close neighbors, try to quiet down as the evening progresses. Your neighbors may have small children who are trying to sleep. Don't make deafening noises or play loud, booming music all night, especially after 9-10:00 pm.

, Geocaching is a real-world, outdoor treasure hunt in which you travel to a specific spot and find containers full of “treasure” left by others. As a general rule, if you take something from a cache, you should leave something of similar value in its place.You’ll need a handheld GPS or smartphone for this activity. You can download the geocaching app or visit http://www.geocaching.com to find a source for your caches.

, If you have a video projector you can hang a sheet in the yard (as the screen) and watch a movie outside. In keeping with your theme, you could even watch a movie about camping. The Parent Trap or Camp Rock are great choices if you are camping with kids, while Without A Paddle and Bushwhacked are better for older audiences., Stargazing is a great wind-down activity. Spread out blankets on the grass and lay down to look at the stars. You could even see who can point out the most constellations, or teach little ones how to find prominent constellations, like Orion. Apps such as “Sky Map” show you the name of each star and constellation by using your location in real time., Have a camera nearby to take silly snapshots of you, your kids, your family members, and your friends. Take one large group shot with everyone smiling and laughing. Be sure to make copies for everyone!


You could even hang a picture frame from a tree branch to create your very own photo booth."

Stay healthy.,
Stay organized.,
Go to class.,
Take notes.,
Study your notes and keep good study habits.,
Learn the art of test taking.",How to Be a Successful Academic," A healthy body will lead to a healthy mind.


Get plenty of sleep, eight to nine hours at best. Don't skimp on it. Any results of procrastination (cramming, dash to finish a project) should be avoided with careful planning and self-discipline. You will sleep better and have better quality work in the process.
Exercise has been proven to stimulate the brain and it relieves stress.
Eat breakfast. Even if it's a little thing, like an apple, you’ll benefit from the improvement in concentration and performance. Eat healthy before a test, especially.;
, How can one study if they don't know where their notes are, or attend a meeting when they don't know when and where it is? Organization is the key to success.


Keep a planner. Short term memory can be unreliable, so write everything down. Note assignments, due dates, meetings, and a ""to do"" list on a calendar. Keep your priorities straight. Avoid procrastination by assigning yourself small parts of a big project over a period of time.
File notes, syllabi, and other works. Whether it be in a binder or an expandable portfolio, you need to know where notes are at all times to study – especially those precious seconds right before a quiz. The syllabus will be helpful in knowing procedures and the teacher's contact information. Keep your work, file it, so you can pull it out as evidence in case the teacher loses it.

, Attendance is part of your grade and just showing up will ensure you 10% of your grade. Also, nothing can replace the good old fashioned lecture.


Be on time. Punctuality is important. Studies show students learn the most in the first twenty minutes of class.
Sit in front where you can hear and see the teacher. You will be less distracted by friends and it will be easier to focus.
Ask questions. You’re there to learn, not be told things you already know. don’t care about sounding stupid. Chances are, at least three people had the same question and will admire you for your guts.
Behave in class. Stay on the teacher’s good side. You will be more comfortable to ask questions if the teacher doesn’t eye you with contempt.

, Don't copy someone else's notes. The act of writing while you take in information will increase your understanding by eighty percent.


Lecture notes: Make sure to take notes in class. The 90/10 scale is recommended: 90% listening, 10% writing. Anything your teacher repeats or emphasizes is likely to be on an upcoming test. Don't worry about writing everything out; as long as you can understand your notes you'll be fine.
Textbook notes: Keep up on your reading and read the material before going to class; it’ll help you better understand the lecture. Use sticky notes to mark questions or thoughts as soon as you think of them. Find the main idea using the headings. Experiment with different note forms (outline, bullet, and Cornell) and see which works best for you.

, Rule of thumb when studying your notes: study once right after you take them, once between then and the test, and once right before the test. Make sure you study them, because simply writing the notes will not guarantee you know the material.


Reread and summarize the material. See if you can tell yourself what you just read from cues in the headings.
Use flashcards. They are convenient to carry around, so you can review while standing in line or waiting for the bus. Very useful for vocabulary, foreign languages, science, and history terms.
Spend extra time on difficult subjects.
Form a study group.
NEVER CRAM. The best thing is to study the day before a test and let yourself off for the night. Cramming is an unreliable method that will will leave you hopelessly fatigued the next day.

, Tests are often weighted heavily in your grade, so it is important to do well on them.


Dress comfortably. You don't want to be too cold, too hot, or have an annoying wedgie while trying to focus.
Be calm and don't panic. Have the mindset that you know this material (and if you have studied, you will), and instead of thinking “I don’t know this” convince yourself, instead, to remember the answer.
Read carefully and take your time. Do not let yourself be intimidated if everyone finishes before you; a good grade will be worth it.

Set out your homework on your desk the night before.,
Go to bed at a sensible hour that is early enough for your sleep needs.,
Decide how many hours you will be needing for your homework.,
Stretch and do some deep breathing exercises before tackling the day.,
Drink warm water mixed with the juice of half a lemon.,
Be seated for your homework.,
Leave small, five-minute worksheets for the end.,
Finish up in time for getting ready for school.",How to Do Homework in the Morning," Take 10 - 15 minutes to look through your homework, to check your diary daily and to set out your homework in readiness for the morning. None of these tasks take much mental effort but they do get you to focus on what needs to be done in the morning and take care of any time you'd otherwise waste on organizing things. Make sure you know what should be done the next day.;
, If your friends want to chat or phone you into the later hours of the night, inform them that they have a deadline, after which you will not be picking up the phone or signing into chat.

, It is better to overestimate than to underestimate. Wake up this many hours early, but make sure you are catching up for this lost sleep at night.

, The stretches will help to wake you up and keep you feeling lithe and strong. The deep breathing will calm you and get you ready for homework without a panic.

, This will wake you up and energize you. It is also a very cleansing drink first thing in the morning. Another alternative you might like to try is warm water with sugar, and a bay leaf. Once it forms a part of your daily routine, you will hate missing it. It is probably also a good idea to eat your breakfast now unless you would rather leave it for after your homework - that choice is personal and up to you but don't miss it.

, The work you did the night before should have set you in good stead to leap right into your homework. Try to tackle it as follows:


Do the most important thing first, so you can get it over and done with.






Do mathematical problems earlier to warm the brain cells up.






Do physics next.
Do English essays, comprehension exercises and other more abstract thinking topics next.

,


Mark off everything on your diary to-do list (if you don't have one, make one - it is both an organizational and motivational tool)

, If you didn't manage to finish everything, do not fret - it is likely you would not have done so anyway. After a week of this new routine, assess whether you are coping with doing your homework in the mornings and whether there may be a need to balance doing some at night and some in the morning or to make other changes to your schedule."

When going to school you want to be comfortable in your body. This means being healthily active and exercising. Please don't mistake this step by going on crazy starvation diets. Don't do that. Go outside play sports, run, do yoga/Pilates or anything active. Do a bit of everything every day. This way you will look good and healthy.;
, Stop drinking carbonated drinks and cut out the gum chewing. Research shows that there are ingredients in bubble/chewing gum that give cancer. Also chewing gum leads to bloating which is not attractive or healthy. Water is the best thing you can drink. Every 45 kg you weigh, 27 kg is water; that's more than half.

, The more sleep you get the better. Take a bath/shower around 20 minutes before you go to sleep as that will help you get a better night of sleep. The worst thing you need when you go to school is puffy dark circles under your eyes. No matter how much product you put on the best natural thing is sleep.

, There is no point to start off the year by not completing any homework. Not good. So finish it off and make sure it's at its best quality. You'll get extra points by giving in good home work. Remember, first impressions count.

,, This stands for Cleansing, Toning and Moisturizing. These steps are incredibly important. Cleanse by using a mild and refreshing face wash. Never use bar soap or shower gel. This is too harsh for the face. There are a lot of good brands like Clean and Clear, Neutrogena or Nivea etc etc. However a really simple mild wash would be Johnson's Baby Wash. That soap is incredibly mild and very gentle to the face yet gives it a very refreshed feeling. Toning is really important as well. Find a toner that matches your skin type. This method is usually skipped out but is actually very important. Buy a good moisturizer as this is the part which keeps your face not feeling dry and smooth.

, Never ever go into a tanning bed. Tanning beds can lead to skin cancer and all sorts of pigmentation. Experimenting with different self tanners can be fun but remember to do this a couple of weeks before. You don't want to stink or look like an Oompa Loompa. The best way would be to get a sun tan but remember to slap on Sun Cream that has around SPF 40. You could try putting on some tanning oil to get a nice even tan.


For girls with a darker complexion, try lemon juice over your face and darker areas on your body like your knees, elbows and arms.

, Wax or shave your legs or arms/underarms. For your face, it's best to thread or bleach. You could also use hair removing creams, but make sure you read the instructions on the packet. When shaving, try putting on some oil to avoid cuts.

, Sexy styles for school could be great. You don't want to get a cut that's hard to manage or extremely complicated. Go for something different yet simple. This shows that you don't spend hours to look good yet gives you a feminine touch to show you care about the way you look. Try to stay in your natural hair colour but if you must try a colour that is slightly similar to your natural hair colour. For example if you have brown hair go for a deep red colour. Don't get blonde highlights in black hair or anything that bold.

, Or you could go out now. On the other hand you could call a friend or ask some one else to give your nails a professional treat.

, Your spa time for school can be awesome. Do this the day before school starts. Naturally giving yourself a little bit of pampering is no crime. All organic and nothing chemical or product-y, can make a better difference then going to expensive spas and using rare products.

, When taking the bath do not wash your hair yet.

, Then use the body brush to gently massage of all the dead skin. While you're in there shave quickly to get rid of anything that would have grown. Be gentle to your under arms though. Pluck your eyebrows/chin/upper lips as well as the steam would have opened your pores; then it won't hurt as much.


A good toner for the body would be rose water. Apply some to your body and moisturize.

, Using a wide tooth comb, comb your hair back and turn on the kettle.

, Take a blanket and put it over your head and the bowl. The steam should clear the pores and turn your face a healthy shade of red, like you have just been exercising. After 15 minutes take off the blanket and discard the water.

, NEVER RUB. Then make a natural facial only. Don't use any products. Make a facial out of honey and banana or search one up for your skin type. Keep it for around 10-15 minutes. Put cucumber slices on your eyes and listen to music. Wash it off and plump your face by putting ice in a sealable bag and gently massage.

, When you finish wait 5 minutes and brush your teeth with a fluoride toothpaste.

, Rub it all over your lips and try not to eat it. Rub the sugar granules all over the lips and wipe it off with a damp tissue. Rub the lips with a bit of Vaseline Jelly.

, It sounds really gross, but it actually works. Keep it on for one hour and wash it off with Shampoo and Conditioner. Use a nice medical shampoo and conditioner like Thursdays Plantation or Rausch to really get rid of every thing and clean the hair. Then use a conditioner of a really nice smell. For example you could use Herbal Essences or L'oreal. When you get out of the shower finish it off with a burst of cold water to close the roots and give a nice shine.

, Shopping 3 weeks before can be better than doing it the day before, as it could get extremely busy and uniform shops might be out of stock. So it's best to do this before.

, Make sure the shirts are comfortable sized and looks a little bit tight to flaunt out your figure. Buy everything properly; if your list says black socks make sure its black and not navy blue. The perfect uniform can make you look like a proud student and teachers will approve that. This does not mean you buy every little thing that's for school. Less is more as in a simple jumper and normal socks and maybe just simple pumps or dabs will do. Don't go for the nursery looking school shoes or anything.

, Small eye-catching studs, thin bracelets and a fashionable watch should do. Don't go for anything else like a neck lace or anything or you might get into trouble.

, Here is a very detailed list of things you will need:


HB pencils/ 1 mechanical pencil, 1 eraser, 1 sharpener, 1 pair of scissors, 1 glue stick, 1 15⁄30 centimeter (0.6 in) ruler, 2 ball pens, 1 ink pen, 10 paper clips, Mini Stapler, Post Its, Binder, Highlighters,Calculator, Geometry Set, Labels, Felt Tips, Colour Pencils, All Books, Text Books, School Planner and Reading Book, School Bag, Pencil Case. Or your school should give you a list of things you will need to buy.

,, Eat a healthy dinner including starch. (athletes usually eat starch before they do their thing so that they will have energy the whole day)

, When you have checked, make sure your alarm is on at the right time and have a good nights sleep.

, Once you've woken up do a couple of stretches to get make sure your body is fit for the day. Once you've finished go brush your teeth and take a shower. Wash every inch of your body and wash your hair in cold water the whole way. Don't shampoo or condition your hair as you did that yesterday.

, Go make breakfast and EAT IT. Don't forget that. Once you've finished make sure your lunch is made and start to get ready. Make sure you have not put on your uniform on yet. Blow dry your hair if you are. Make sure you use a heat protectant. From there decide what you want to do. While you think put on your uniform. If you are going straighten/curl/crimp/whatever your hair do it carefully to make it perfect and not burn your self.

, Now it's school, not a fashion show, so always think neutral. No funky colours or anything. This is just to redefine your looks. So start by applying tinted moisturizer (better than foundation). Make sure its evenly applied not only on your face but your neck and a bit of your decolletage. then take a concealer and apply it under your eyes, around the nose and at the end of your lips.

, Take a big make up brush and just blend it all in perfectly. Starting with your eyes, apply some light brown or charcoal grey eyeliner on your waterline. This helps to bring out a bit of definition on your eyes. Instead of applying eyeshadow, put on some bronzer lightly on your eyelids and blend well. Then curl your lashes and apply 2 thin coats of mascara. That's the eyes. Take a bit of bronzer and apply to your cheeks and very lightly on your T-zone. If you would like apply a little bit of blusher as well. A cream blusher would be the best. Last but not least add a bit of flavoured lip balm to finish of.


Applying this much makeup would be good just for a couple of the first days. Then you can narrow it down just to mascara, concealer, bronzer and lip balm.

, In a small bag keep lip balm, wipes and mints to keep clean and happy. Put on your jewelry. Check around and make sure you have taken everything. This can include your phone/iPod etc.

, You want to do well in class and participate. Not only is school there for looking good a impressing boys but also to learn something new, make friends and be happy. So be friendly say hi to everyone be polite and try to do this until the very end of the year. It won't take that much of hard work just a bit determination and will-power.

Talk to your English teacher/speech coach about joining Humorous Duo.,
Look through scripts.,
Once you have found a piece you like, read through it.,
Start practicing.,
Once you have it down, perform it.,
Start with a quick excerpt, then provide your own written introduction.,
Do not look at each other.,
Give your conclusion, and sit down.",How to Perform a Humorous Duo in Speech Class," If it is available, join it. Make sure you have a partner.;
, You can look at the scripts provided, or check online. You can use a script from a funny skit, sketch, book, movie, anything!

, If you and your partner think you should do it, start cutting it. Cut parts out, re-arrange, and edit the script so that it fits your needs.

, The speech needs to be 7 minutes long. Time yourselves.

, At speech meets, go to the Humorous Duo section and wait for your turn. Once you are ready, go up.

, You are required to write your own introduction.

, Angle towards your partner, but never look at him/her. That is an automatic disqualification. In scene transitions/character changes (you or your partner may be required to perform multiple characters), slide across, switching places (again, not looking at each other).

, Once the round is over, you may leave.

Keep the work that you are supposed to be doing out on your desk.,
Slowly slide the page that you want to work on halfway out from under the page that you are supposed to be working on.

Write with your hand towards the desk, but look like you are working very intently.

,
Make sure you are not working too intently, or else your teacher will walk by and realize you are working on something you aren't supposed to be working on.

Start shopping around and get clothes that are either unisex or follow the new trends.,
Try cutting (or having a hairdresser cut) your hair in a pixie cut, either slicked back or natural.,
Eyebrow size and shape is another characteristic that is strongly associated with gender.,
If you particularly care for makeup, line your eyes in grey or black eyeliner but nothing too flashy or obvious.,
As for the shoes, converse and oxfords (high heels for girls) work.,
Be independent.,
Avoid wearing soft and powdery colors like they're the plague.,
Compress your breasts if you have them.,
Hide your legs, unless you don't shave them.,
Don't worry about others' opinions; what other people think of you is not anything to be extremely concerned about.

,
Be in shape.",How to Look Androgynous," For example: get straight leg pants, button downs, cardigans but nothing too girly. Preferably in shades of grey, blue, black and red.;
, If you don't have the proper face shape to get a pixie, you can always get a bob and style it the way you want. Asymmetric haircuts are all the rage right now. If you're a guy; grow your hair long, maybe get a side-fringe. It's more difficult for girls with long hair to look neutral, but if you love your Rapunzel locks or can't stand having hair in your face, you can probably make traditional hair styles work. Or, you could just put all your hair under a hat.

, If you are a male, try plucking or waxing your brows to a thinner, arched, feminine brow. If you are a female, try letting your brows grow out to (or keep them as) their natural shape.

, Forget the red lipstick and the blush. Stick to foundation, matte powder and maybe concealer to hide the pink in your lips. (Go easy on that; you don't want to look like a corpse).

, Anything will do as long as it's not too flashy or girly. Sneakers will work well for casual dress.

, Be the kind of person who can do things for themselves. You can try to get things done by yourself such as cleaning your bedroom, doing your homework, and maybe cooking or cleaning. This will show you are responsible and independent.

, But you don't always have to wear bold, dark colors like black. Other colors can be neutral such as navy blue, forest green, brown, and black. Camouflage is a good pattern to stick with.

, These are a big give away. You should be completely flat. A sports bra may work if you are very small, but for anyone over a AA it won't work. You will need some sort of binder. Please note that binding can be dangerous and damages tissue over time. If you are about an A or a very small B you can use under-armor, which is intended for men who are athletes. You should be able to find their compression vests in a sports store. Under-works, Mango and T-Kingdom make these.

, Girls have very different legs than guys, and they are usually shaved. Try a pair of really baggy jeans to hide your curves and maybe a loose belt slung low on the hips. Couple this with a really big t-shirt, and you can fit in almost anywhere.

,, When it comes to physique, well, that one can be a bit harder. Build some muscle! Don't go body building (because some ""muscles"" are better left undefined).

Choose the tomboy style you want to have.,
Start with shoes.,
Choose your pants and shorts.,
Choose shirts, sweatshirts and jackets.,
Add some accessories.,
Get the haircut.,
Don't care.,
Choose swimsuits carefully.",How to Take on a Tomboy Style," You get the outdoorsy, no-flair tomboy style (outdoor gear), the super sporty tomboy style (lots of sports clothing) or the street wear sporty style with graphic t-shirts and and dog funk hats.;
, This means no high heels or ballet flats, but there is more to it than this. Choose either skater shoes, or runners, with a masculine design, and preferably a brand such as converse, Reebok etc. Here is where you can play around a bit with funky colors, you do not necessarily have to choose black. Camouflage, red, dark green, and neon colors are still cool without being girly. If you don't like that you can wear wedge sneakers.

, Invest in some jeans, preferably on the loose side, choose a pair that are a little faded (light, not dark jeans), and distressed detailing is also a good option.


There should be no flares, no skinny jeans, no embroidery detailing, and no fading around butt or hip area.
Definitely have sweatpants, but stay away from tight exercise pants and opt for looser fitting, drawstring sweatpants. A great place to find these is at college or high school gym wear stores, most sports stores only sell tight fitting ones. Also, invest in board shorts, or exercise (mesh shorts) Make sure they come almost to the knee, or a little longer, no tight fitting shorts (camouflage pants are another cool option).

, Stick to the boy's section (or the girl's section). Even if the detailing is masculine in the boy's section, women's shirts are meant to conform to your curves which is okay but not wanted.


A graphic t-shirt will give you more of a ""street wear"" look, otherwise solid, or simple design shirts are fine.
You don't have to stay away from pink, most purples, and pastel colours; you can still be a tomboy and still like those colours because they're just colours, not defining of your gender.
If you choose to wear a tank top, you don't have to wear a men's tank top but make sure it's not too tight.
Get a hoodie from the boy's or girl's section, a kangaroo (or pullover) hoodie will give you the carefree outdoorsy look, and a graphic zip up hoodie from the boy's section will give you more of a street wear look.
For a jacket, two-toned jackets are sporty, and usually have a masculine vibe, just stay away from pea coats, or anything to fashionable, or feminine.

, Great ones would be:


Outdoor broad-brimmed hats (the carefree outdoorsy tomboy).
Baseball caps (sporty).
Trucker caps (street wear).
Avoid engineer hats, or military style hats, or berets.
For winter, stick with tuques.
Necklaces should have a thicker chain, preferably be silver, and have earthy detailing, rings are fine but should be dull and silver, stick to earthy jewelry, as opposed to glamorous jewelry.
Earrings should be studs, and nose or eyebrow piercings are fine (more of a street wear look).
Shop for wristbands, rubber slogan bracelets, rubber or cloth strap watches, and watches with large, chunky, faces.
Bracelets should be very simple, bulky and masculine, or just a wristband.


Just think: Would my brother/guy friend/boy friend/dad/etc., wear this? If he wouldn't, don't buy it. For winter, tuques are great; do not wear berets, and stick with black, or masculine colored tuques, and simple, masculine colored scarves, and chunky no-style, no-fur, winter boots.

, Do not get layers, if you choose to wear longer hair, and bangs should be cut straight across, and not side-swept. A ponytail, and a short haircut are also optional. You can pretty much choose what you want here, but avoid anything too fashionable (unless it is more a masculine fashion style) Ponytails should be not too low, and not too high.

, You should look as though you didn't put any effort into your appearance (or very little). However, avoid looking sloppy.

, Don't go for a full on bikini. But go for something that exposes a bit because you a still a girl.

Depending on your breast size, you may need to tie them down with some non-stretchy fabric.,
Find an old collared shirt or an oversized T-shirt.,
Trousers are the most difficult if you don't have a brother.,
Your shoes are probably the easiest part.,
Now that you are dressed, you need to really look the part.,
Girls with very short hair have it easy.,
Imitate male body language.",How to Look and Act Like a Guy (for Girls)," Wearing an old band bra (no under-wiring or padding) or a sports bra will help, but they are often not tight enough to really bind them down. You can bind them down with bandages too, but make you don't use ace bandages, as they can harm your lungs and kill you. So pay attention to what you pick up.;
, It needs to be comfortably and boyishly loose, plus a little more to hide boobs if binding them isn't entirely successful. You can also wear a baggy jacket or raincoat to help hide tell-tale body parts.

, Baggy pajama pants or army pants work fairly well if you don't have any male siblings.

, Trainers, vans, black converses, or other gender generic work fabulously.

, Wash off any existing make-up. Using an eyeliner pencil, shade in girly eyebrows carefully, go for longer eyebrows. A little bit goes a long way, and you need to look like you aren't wearing any make-up. If you have a nude, non-shiny lipstick, use it to hide your femininely more rosy and full lips. Again, use carefully. Facial hair is tricky, because unless you have realistic costume beards, it won't really work. Take your eyeliner and lightly pencil in hair on the upper lip, but only so that the existing hairs look darker, like you've forgotten to shave.

, Mess up your locks a bit and maybe put on a boyish hat and you are all set. Otherwise, you can go for the greasy male ponytail, but that won't be very convincing unless you really try. You can tuck long hair up into baseball caps or wear the jacket hood up to hide it. Remember some boys do have shoulder-length hair. Go for the skater look if you do.

, When you are sitting, spread your legs and try to take up as much space as possible try to copy the mouth movements too.

Grow your hair long or get extensions.,
If you want, dye your hair a golden blonde, or depending on what you look like, dye your hair a flattering color.,
Get a slight sun-kissed glow by using a little bronzer or fake tanner.,
Play up your eyes.,
Wear black mascara and apply it slightly heavier on the outer eyelash hairs.,
Tweeze your eyebrows into a slightly peaked, arch shape.,
Get lovely lips.,
Study Bardot photos and movies and try to emulate her clothing style using modern versions or checking out vintage clothing stores.,
Get a pair of black sex-kitten high heel shoes.",How to Be a Sex Kitten Like Brigitte Bardot," Wear it in a loose, wavy tumbling style. Try hot rollers, a wide barrel curling iron, or else just wash and wear if you happen to have naturally wavy hair. Try to get a lot of volume too. Experiment with different methods and modern tools and products, see what works best for your hair.;
, Add some highlights, go a shade darker-whatever will make you feel more confident and beautiful.

, OR, if you've got paler skin, work it! Don't forget to use SPF all the time, especially on your face, since sunburn (and premature wrinkles!) isn't sexy.

, Brigitte Bardot had large hazel-brown ones, but every eye color is pretty-as long as you know what looks right on you. If you've got brown eyes, purples look great. Green and hazel eyes look nice with darker greens & browns. Blues look pretty with navy. To get Brigitte Bardot's eye make up, use liquid or gel liner (preferably in black) and line your eyes with it adding a wingtip. Make it a skinny line on the inside (close to your nose) and then thicken out. This is a cat-eye. If you want, you can wing it out past the end of your eyes. This is really pretty and flattering if done right. You may also want to do smokey eyes-blend black, gray and a lighter gray on your eyelids, then line your eyes with black.Remember, with these looks, try to keep the rest of your face bare (at the most, a little foundation, concealer, light blush, and a light lip gloss-try to keep it nude.)

, If you have thin lashes, try false eyelashes or eyelash extensions which you can get at a salon.

, Study BB photos to perfect this look. Her brows were not too thin, not too thick and a few shades darker then her hair.

, If you already have lush, full lips like BB, just wear a simple tinted pink lip gloss or a pearly pink, peach, or neutral lipstick & liner. If you have thin lips, look into a neutral liner or lip augmentation. If lip injections are not your thing, try one of the new plumping lip gloss products on the market or experiment with different types of lip liner. Whatever you do, stick with a natural color on the lips, BB rarely wore red lipstick or intense colors. Her focus was always more on the eyes.

, She was feminine and simple and liked little black dresses, lace, polka dots and minimal jewelry.

, Go for a classic pump, or perhaps an open toe, a medium thickness of heel or maybe a strappy sandal. Avoid anything over 3 inches (7.6 cm), such as 5 inch (12.7 cm) clear platform stripper heels!

, This gives your hair shine and luster.

, This will give your hair a healthier and softer feel.

,, Blow drying hair is very damaging. If you must blow dry, use it on the coldest setting.

, It can be beach waves, pin straight, or ringlets. Of course you can change it, but this will be how your hair is most days when you ""don't do anything"" to it.

, Bangs are a good idea! You can have side bangs or straight bangs. Also, little face framing layers are really cute. The length is your choice, long or short, depending on your taste and hair health. Get your hair cut once every 6 months/year

, You can dye your hair any color you want, but no highlights! Blonde, brunette, red, black, blue, pink, rainbow, it doesn't matter as long as you maintain the dye job.

, You can do half ups, pigtails, buns, or braids. As long as the hairstyle is oh-so-cute it is great. Cute ""school girl"" ponytails are very cute.

, Use little bows, tiny hair ribbons, cute barrettes and bobby pins, or anything else. If you see it and you'd think a porcelain doll would wear it, then it is perfect.

, Cream is preferred, but gel is acceptable if that is all you have. If you are under 13 do this step 2 times a week. Rinse with warm water.

, Eat tiny sandwiches and crackers and fruits and vegetables. Little sweets are good sometimes. Just eat small proportions and those extra pounds will fall off. Also, you will be much healthier if you only occasionally eat junk food.

, That means no tanning, no injuring, and no dirtying. You don't want old haggard skin that is dirty, wrinkly, spotty, and broken, do you? If not, always wear sunscreen, be careful, and clean yourself.

, Throw out anything you couldn't see a China doll wearing. Organize and sort through the clothes you have left and hang them up in an easy to find way.

, Here is a list of the basics you will need:


3 Cardigans (Pink, White, Blue)
1 Blazer (Navy)
As many skirts as possible (Floral, Patterned, Solid)

, Most living dolls have YouTubes, Tumblrs, Instagrams, Blogs, Google+, and Twitters. They post photo-shoots of themselves, hair/fashion/makeup tutorials, blogs, reviews, etc. Take pictures with your cute friends and upload them. Take pictures of what you are doing, stuff you buy, and places you go. You may soon get a fan following. Try not to edit your pictures that much, this only causes drama and controversy.

Break the dress code.",How to Dress Like Nicki Minaj," Choose a pushup bra and pair of panties that can be worn under tight clothing. Depending on what you wear, you can show the bra or hide it. Minaj sometimes shows off a beautiful bra under vest or low-cut dress.


Wear a bra that fits or is a size too small. Wear a bra that fits if you aren't going to show a lot of cleavage. Get fitted at a department store: most women wear the wrong size.If you'd like to pop a lot of cleavage, wear a cup size small. Get the right size band, however, or the line of your back will be wavy.
If you're wearing super tight clothing, you may not be able to wear underwear without having visible panty line issues. Wear leggings or tights instead.;
, Bodycon, or “bandage” dresses are tight and elastic, made to hug curves and enhance cleavage. Minaj often wears long or short bodycon dresses with cutouts over the cleavage or at her ribcage. Bodycon dresses must be tight and move with your body, but they don't have to show every wrinkle. Go with a sturdy but stretchy fabric if you want to hide your bra line.


Mix it up with babydoll skirts and goddess drapery. A Minaj-inspired dress must squeeze (bodycon), drape (goddess), echo (with prints, corsets, and sculptural dress-jewelry), or reveal (with transparencies or cut-outs) your curves.
Minaj always defines her waist. If you wear a dress that drapes, make sure the fabric changes directions at your waist, for a figure-eight effect. If you get a babydoll dress, make sure the skirt drops off at the waist. Empire waists are a no-go.

, Minaj usually wears four to eight inch heels or platforms. Shoes are a great place to make your statement: try wearing cut-out or gladiator sandals, colorful fringe, or shocks of fur. Doc Martens in bright colors, thigh-high boots, and bondage-strappy boots are also excellent options.

, During the day, drag a big gorgeous bag around: choose leather, or colorful fur. A Hajaraku or punk-inspired clutch with studs or cartoon details is good for a night out.


Wear a hat, a wig, or both. As part of her Kmart collection, Minaj has designed military-style hats adorned with gold chains and studs. Find a hat at a thrift store and decorate it yourself.
Minaj goes big with colorful wigs. Pick a blonde poof or a straight candy-colored cut with bangs.

, Minaj looks wonderful in chains, pendants, bangles and dangling earrings. You can favor fashions from the 1980s with enamel and gold highlights. Don’t be afraid to wear all these items at once.


Get minimal with cuffs. Minaj's minimal looks feature plain metal cuffs, at the wrist or on her upper arms. Go for all gold or all silver, and pair with a long dark sleeveless dress.

, Nicki Minaj designed a line for Kmart that included patterned legging and shirt sets, bodycon dresses and deconstructed denim. Many of these feature animal prints and patterns worn head to toe.You can purchase each piece for $12 to $50, making it one of your least expensive options.

, Try H&M or Forever 21 if you want to collect stylish separates that are similar to her designer threads. You can pick up classic Minaj-outfit pieces like patterned leggings, distressed high-waisted jeans (and matching denim jackets), and short fluorescent skirts.

, You can shop new styles by Fergie and Jessica Simpson. Try shoe warehouses, like DSW, to find designer heels at discount prices. If your foot size is unusual, a search through an upscale thrift store or the sales section of a designer website can turn up treasures.

, If you have the cash, you can shop the same brands as Nicki Minaj. Minaj wears a lot of Givenchy. She's expressed love for Donatella Versace, Betsey Johnson, Alexander McQueen, and Alexander Wang, and she's worn exciting younger designers like Manish Arora and Onch Movement.The brand she raps about the most is Louis Vuitton, but that might be because it’s fun to say.If you can afford it, go for Louis Vuitton luggage and bags.


For the monster look, buy Giuseppe Zanotti shoes.Minaj has also been spotted wearing Manolo Blahnik, Jimmy Choo, and a lot of Christian Louboutin.

, Minaj has worn long, cropped and mid-length styles in blond for several years. It allows her to dye her hair bright colors more easily. Minaj uses oil to keep her hair hydrated, as bleach can really take the life out of hair. Talk to your stylist about the best bleaching approach for your hair.


Use coconut oil during bleaching, and treat your hair regularly with it to maintain vitality.

, If you have blond, long or cropped hair, consider dying it fluorescent pink, green or several colors at once. Semi-permanent dyes may allow you to change it frequently, just like the rap-star does.

, The cut should been extremely straight, with the sides at 90 degree angles to the fringe. If you can’t pull off this look, buy a cropped bright-colored wig to create a more convincing look.


If you don’t want bangs, wear your hair long and part it in the center.
Keep it straight most of the time. Although she occasionally has worn wavy hair, Minaj is usually seen with stick straight hair.
Wear your hair in pigtails. You can achieve a Harajaku schoolgirl look with this style.

, Purchase fake lashes. You can find them at large makeup stores like Sephora and Ulta, or at costume shops. Wear heavy cat eye makeup. Use a black liquid eyeliner. Start near the inside of your top lid and draw a line that extends outside your eye line.


Fill in your lids with bright blue, aqua or green eye shadow.

, Minaj says she can't be without pink lipstick, pink blush, and black mascara.If you are wearing your Minaj outfit during the day, you can also pick a nude color.

, Change your look constantly. Minaj is like David Bowie: she can't be boxed in. Her look changes as soon as you think you have it down. As long as your clothing is tight and majestic, you can mix it up as much as you want.


Follow your taste until you discover a new look. Minaj has a cast of characters she raps as and represents in her clothing, but she doesn't dress up ""as"" them. Instead, she dresses until a character emerges. Play around with different styles until you feel a look developing, then fine tune it.For instance, if you notice yourself gravitating towards ruffles and pinks, go superfemme and add a pink wig and a bonnet.
If you see yourself frequently reaching for sleek metallic clothes, go full Cleopatra, with dark eye makeup and large golden jewelry.

, Minaj's style icons are Grace Jones, Cyndi Lauper, Naomi Campbell, Marilyn Monroe, and Iman. Explore images of them to find looks you can copy.Try combining styles: put Cyndi Lauper's fearless use of color with Grace Jones' bold command of silhouette.

, Anything you wouldn't be allowed to wear in high school is probably the right cut for a Nicki Minaj look. Wear bodysuits, belly-baring crop tops, bras instead of shirts, and leggings instead of pants. If your outfit is not easy to wear—if you have to adjust often, walk strategically, catch your balance, or glue something in place, you're on the right track.

Employ deep breathing.,
Count to 10—or 20.,
Practice progressive muscle relaxation.,
Cultivate positive thoughts.,
Find humor and positive in any situation.",How to Control an Adrenaline Rush1," Deep breathing exercises, which is also called pranayama, can naturally help dissolve tension and help you relax.Do a few deep breathing exercises to help yourself relax and refocus yourself as well as alleviate other symptoms of an adrenaline rush.


Deep breathing can help your body distribute oxygen to your body, which can reduce heart rate and normalize your pulse. It will also help relax tense muscles that may be exacerbating the adrenaline rush.Inhale and exhale completely and in a balanced manner through your nose. For example, you would inhale for a count of four, hold for two, counts, and then exhale completely to a count of four. You can vary the counts according to your abilities.To get the most from deep breathing, sit upright, with your shoulders back, feet flat on the ground, and avoid slouching. Put you hands on your belly and practice breathing slowly making the stomach move against the hands. When you exhale, tighten your stomach muscles and breathe out through pursed lips. Consciously feel the diaphragm move up and down as you breathe.;
, When you are feeling stressed, anxious or having an adrenaline rush, remove yourself from the situation and count to ten. Counting can help your mind to focus on something other than situation.When you focus on something other than the stressful situation, your body may stop producing adrenaline.
If necessary, count to twenty and repeat the procedure as often as you need to., If you notice stress or anxiety triggering a rush of adrenaline, practice relaxing your whole body to bring yourself down. Lie on the ground or sit down and begin clenching and relaxing each muscle in your body.Start with your feet:


Tighten and contract each muscle in your body for five seconds starting at your feet. Then let the muscles slowly ease into deep relaxation. After 10 seconds, tighten your leg muscles for another five seconds and then let them relax.Repeat this succession until to finish with your head.Move on to the muscles in your legs. Do the same process for each muscle group, making your way slowly up your body towards your head.

, Negativity can exacerbate stress, tension, and anxiety, and may make adrenaline rushes more acute.Framing any situation in a more positive manner may help you overcome and control subsequent adrenaline rushes or panic attacks.Framing is a behavioral technique that can shape the ways in which you handle specific situations by rendering them positive scenario.For example, you may find yourself dealing with an angry customer at your job. Imagine that the best possible outcome is making the customer happier by solving the problem. This can help you get through the situation in the most positive manner and may keep you from getting a panic attack.Another way to use the process of visualizing a positive outcome is by imaging a very peaceful scene, such as a field of flowers, and placing yourself in the scene.
You can also try practicing mindfulness. This is the process of recognizing your thinking and how it makes your feel in that moment, without judgement., Most difficult situations can have some positive and humorous moments. Although they may not be immediately clear to you, being able to recognize and laugh at them can help you to relax and avoid adrenaline rushes.Some studies have demonstrated that positivity can contribute significantly to happiness.For example, if you fall and cut your elbow, don’t focus on the cut or a tear in your clothing. Instead, laugh at your clumsiness or something else humorous that happened in the situation.

Avoid Excedrin in the future.",How to Kick an Excedrin Addiction1," Most people start taking Excedrin to control headaches. But you can develop a dependency very quickly. What happens is that Excedrin shuts off pain receptors in your brain, and these receptors become more sensitive the more you use the drug. This means that you get “rebound” headaches without the drug.You can develop a dependence on Excedrin by using it as little as 15 days a month.Excedrin also contains about as much caffeine as a cup of coffee. So, with regular use you can develop an addiction to caffeine, as well.You may therefore have two addictions: one to Excedrin as a pain reliever and another to caffeine.
Do you get headaches most days and often in the morning? Do these headaches go away with medicine but return once the medicine wears off? These are common signs of dependence to a pain reliever. Listlessness, nausea, memory or concentration problems, and irritability are also symptoms.;
, Nip your habit in the bud if you notice that you are becoming dependent on Excedrin. There are different ways to go about this. You do not have to stop taking the drug entirely, as your body will need to adjust, and can slowly wean yourself. There is also the harder “cold turkey” method.


To go cold turkey, just stop taking the drug. You’ll be able to kick the habit quickly this way and will see just how much your body craves Excedrin.
The cold turkey method is very hard, though. Prepare for severe withdrawal headaches lasting days or even weeks. You may experience a loss of productivity because of them. Many people give up under these circumstances.To wean yourself slowly, reduce the dosage of Excedrin you take each day. The idea is to do this gradually so that your body becomes used to less and less until you are no longer taking the medication. While the process will last longer than cold turkey, your withdrawal will not be as bad.
Expect your rebound headaches to improve 6 to 12 weeks after you’ve stopped taking medication entirely., Ask family, friends, or your partner for help if you are having trouble reducing your dosage of Excedrin. Their help might be for moral encouragement or more practical, like if you are in withdrawal. They will be more than happy to do so.


For example, you might have a family member or friend be your “pharmacist.” They can hide the pills and only allow you a set amount for that day.
Kind words and encouragement from family and loved ones is a great boost. It also helps that they know what you’re experiencing, and why you might be irritable or not your usual self.
Loved ones can also help you with the weaning process. You may be in bad shape for a few days with withdrawal. Ask family or friends if they can provide food, for example, or pitch in with your errands.People who take prescription headache medicines like Imitrex often receive just 10 pills for the whole month, so you might consider having a family member ""dispense"" Excedrin to you in this way or limit yourself to 10 per month.

, To prevent a relapse, stay away from the drug in the future once you’ve successfully detoxed and weaned yourself. There are alternative over-the-counter medications that are less likely to cause addiction, such as Ibuprofen.


Talk to your doctor about other possible painkillers if you continue to have headaches or migraines. She should be able to suggest an alternative.
Read drug labels in the future to see if they have addictive qualities, as well.

Learning how to navigate or eliminate situations that are causing you stress or anxiety may help you to minimize or alleviate adrenaline rushes.Make a list of triggers for adrenaline rushes. Read the list and check off what you can actively control.For example, maybe staff meetings cause adrenaline rushes. Take steps to minimize your anxiety in the situation, such as being fully prepared, meditating in the five minutes before the meeting, or sitting next to positive people.If a friend is causing you stress because she is causing drama, decrease the amount of time you spend with that friend.

, There is evidence that aerobic and cardiovascular activity can have a positive effect on your mood and calm you down.Talk to your doctor before you begin any new exercise program.


Even 10 minutes of exercise can help you relax and refocus. For example, a 10 minute walk can relax you and give you a chance to think about the positive in your life.Exercise stimulates the production of endorphins and serotonin, which can improve your mood and help you sleep and may minimize or relieve adrenaline rushes.Any type of exercise will do. Consider walking, hiking, swimming, canoeing, or running.

These will stretch tense muscles and relax you. Restorative and yin yoga are two excellent choices to help with adrenaline rushes.If you don’t have the time to commit to a full yoga session, do downward facing dog for 10 deep inhalations and exhalations. Downward facing dog is an important foundational pose in yoga that can not only calm and relax you, but will also stretch your tense muscles.Talk to your doctor before you begin any yoga practice to make sure you’re healthy enough to practice., Poor diet can deplete your energy and cause stress or anxiety, which may in turn stimulate adrenaline rushes. Eating healthy foods and snacks will not only help your overall health, but may lessen stress, anxiety, and relieve adrenaline rushes.Foods such as asparagus have mood-enhancing nutrients and may help minimize stress stress.Food choices that are high in vitamin B can also minimize stress and anxiety. Avocados and beans are good choices of foods rich in vitamin B.A glass of warm milk can soothe insomnia and anxiety, which can exacerbate adrenaline rushes., It’s advisable to avoid all recreational drugs and limit or cut out alcohol and caffeine. These substances can aggravate anxiety and make you more prone to adrenaline rushes.Most adults can tolerate 400mg of caffeine per day. This is the equivalent of four cups of coffee, ten cans of soda, or two energy drinks. If you are experiencing persistent rushes of adrenaline, try to decrease how much caffeine you’re consuming.Women should consume no more than one serving of alcohol a day and men no more than two. Examples of one drink include: 2 fluid ounces (355 milliliters) of beer, 5 fluid ounces (148 milliliters),1.5 fluid ounces (44 milliliters) of 80 proof distilled spirits., Split up any tasks, errands, or uncomfortable situations you have into manageable sections of time. Breaks can help you relax and refresh your mind and body. A break may also help you control an adrenaline rush or stave one off.Reading a book, watching a movie, taking a bubble bath, or spending time walking your dog or talking with your partner can all help to clear your head of the stresses from the day.
Do activities that you enjoy during your break. A short walk is an excellent way to take a break. It gets you away from your task, circulates your blood and gets oxygen to your brain, lets your mind wander, and helps you relax.Setting aside “worry” or “wander” time is also important. Give yourself a set time every day to let your mind deal with any problems you may have or just to do nothing. Having these types of breaks to recharge is as important as the small breaks you take between tasks.
Just as breaks are important, try and schedule a vacation at least once a year, which can give you a chance to relax and unplug.

, Tension, anxiety and panic attacks cause physical changes in your body. Let yourself get and enjoy a massage to help you relax, which may help control your adrenaline rushes.A professional masseuse can feel and remove tension in your muscles Some studies show that massage can release tense muscles.There are many types of massage available. Choose one that you can enjoy most. Any amount of massage will release oxytocin, which can help relax you and relieve tension.You can locate a qualified massage therapists either online or through a doctor’s recommendation.If you can’t visit a professional massage therapist, try self-massage. Rubbing your shoulders, face, or even ear lobes can significantly help to reduce your stress., Every person needs sleep in order to maintain physical and mental health and help them relax.Aim to get 7-9 hours of sleep every night to help recharge and relax yourself, which may also help control your adrenaline rushes.Practice good sleep hygiene, which includes going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, making your room conductive to sleep, and avoiding stimulants around bedtime.
Increased stress, anxiety and panic attacks can result from insufficient sleep.Short naps of 20–30 minutes during the day may also help you feel better., Joining a support group of others who suffer from anxiety or panic disorders can offer you unconditional support from others who understand what you’re experiencing. It may also give you some helpful ways in which you can cope with your adrenaline rushes.If there isn’t a support group in your area, consider confiding in a close friend or family member about what you’re experiencing. You may find that even speaking to someone you love can minimize your stress and anxiety. Someone outside of a stressful situation can often see a logical way to handle it more effectively than someone who is in the midst of the it.

, If you find that your adrenaline rushes are significantly affects your life or are so severe that the physical symptoms are unbearable, see your doctor. Your doctor can help you formulate a treatment plans that may include psychotherapy, medication, or other lifestyle methods.For example if you are having anxiety your doctor may prescribe a benzodiazepines or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for therapy.

Set up an appointment with a doctor.,
Begin a detox program if you have other addictions as well.,
See a headache specialist or neurologist.,
Seek counseling.,

Consider alternative medicine.",How to Kick an Excedrin Addiction2," Breaking an addiction is hard. Talk to your doctor about options if you are having trouble cutting out Excedrin on your own or if you would prefer to seek medical help. She can set up a plan to break your habit and to mitigate your symptoms in the meanwhile. This is called “bridge” or transition therapy.Your doctor can prescribe a painkiller that is short acting and non-habit forming, for example. She may also give you meds to alleviate your withdrawal symptoms, like anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteriods.Your doctor may also put you on a detoxification program.
Mostly like you will not need a hospital visit. However, in some cases you may be admitted for a short stay, particularly if you aren’t able to stop on your own, are abusing other drugs along with Excedrin, or have limited family support., Your doctor may put you in an outpatient treatment plan for addiction if you have other addictions along with your addiction to Excedrin, such as addiction to prescription painkillers or illegal substances. This will involve a detoxification process to remove the drug from your system, helping you to be less dependent on it.


Good outpatient centers are able to cater to specific addictions and to tailor a plan for you. They can also provide resources like counseling and prepare you to cope with any mental obstacles.Take into account the services that each prospective program offers. Also consider location. Some may want to be close to family and friends. However, people with unhealthy or co-dependent relationships may need to put distance between themselves and loved ones, at least for a time.Your doctor can most likely recommend a drug addiction center to guide you through the detox process.

, If you have been suffering from headaches for a long time and self-medicating wit Excedrin, then seeing a specialist may be necessary. A doctor who specializes in headaches or a neurologist can assess your symptoms and run tests to determine if there is an underlying cause.

A specialist can also prescribe a treatment plant that will help to prevent you from becoming dependent on Excedrin again.

, Some people suffer from both psychological and physical addiction to Excedrin. This means that you become mentally dependent on the drug and, without it, can experience anxiety, a feeling of being unable to cope, a mental obsession with it, mood swings, or insomnia.If you think you are experiencing psychological addiction, set up an appointment with a psychologist who can work with you to kick it.


Your therapist will be able to alleviate any concerns that you or your family may have. You can set up a group family therapy session, too, if need be.
To offer you coping strategies, a psychologist may also recommend a course of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. The aim of CBT is to teach you how to identify and stop problematic behavior.CBT techniques can include discussing the positive and negatives effects of your habit, teaching you how to monitor your cravings, and developing ways to deal with cravings and to avoid “high-risk” situations when you might relapse.

, Some people find that alternative therapies give relief for headaches and can complement other treatments. Since not all of these treatments have proven medical benefit, talk with your doctor before starting one.

Acupuncture is one alternative treatment. There is some evidence that this ancient Chinese practice can help to bring headaches under control.“Biofeedback” is a technique that teaches you better control over your body. You are first hooked up to devices that monitor your breathing, heart rate, and other functions and give feedback. The idea is to slowly learn your natural bodily response to pain and to learn how to reduce muscle tension, control your breathing and heart rate, and deal with pain.Some herbs and “natural” medicines claim to alleviate headaches, like butterbur and feverfew. However, the medical benefit of these herbs is unclear. Talk to a doctor before taking any dietary supplements, especially since they can interact with other drugs you are taking."

Cut caffeine out of your diet.,
Follow a plan to detox from caffeine.,
Drink plenty of water.",How to Kick an Excedrin Addiction3," Excedrin contains caffeine and can lead to (or worsen) a caffeine dependence. Excedrin Migraine, for instance, contains 65 mg of caffeine, or nearly as much as a cup of regular coffee (about 80 mg).Drinking coffee while taking it can also increase your addiction.


Reducing your caffeine intake will help to address a possible source of headaches – caffeine withdrawal headaches – that are unrelated to your normal headaches and to “rebound headaches.”
In addition to coffee, try to limit your consumption of other caffeinated substances like colas, black tea, energy drinks, and chocolate.

, You might find the concept of cutting coffee and caffeine out of your life to be painful. However, you do not have to entirely eliminate them from your life. The aim is only to reduce your intake, so that you are no longer dependent. People can safely consume coffee two or three times per week without building up a tolerance.As with Excedrin, you can choose to go cold turkey or slowly wean yourself. Cold turkey will be faster but involve worse headaches and poorer concentration.
If you decide to go slow, your schedule might look something like this. On Day 1 you drink your usual amount. On Days 2-5, make coffee that is half caffeinated and half decaf. On Day 6, blend 25% caffeinated coffee with 75% decaf coffee. At this stage, your body will be getting used to having less coffee in its system. On Day 7 drink purely decaf coffee.
Decaf coffee still has a small amount of the drug, about 2-12 mg.If you want to go fully without caffeine, switch over to a grain or plant alternative like chicory root.
Teas are a great, lower caffeine option. Black and green tea have modest amounts (between 14-70 mg depending on type and how long you steep it), and will work to “cut” your withdrawal symptoms. Herbal teas are usually totally caffeine-free., Stay hydrated while you wean yourself off coffee. Some people think that the less thirsty you are, the less likely you will be to crave coffee. Gulp an 8 oz. glass of water first thing in the morning and stay well-watered throughout the day.According to the Mayo Clinic, adult men should try to drink at least three liters of water per each day.Women should try to drink about 2.2. liters each day."

A great way to help you get clear on all of the advantages of living a drug-free life is to make a list of the benefits of sobriety. Here are some things that you may want to consider:


Meth use often impacts your quality of life. Your finances take a hit and relationships may be destroyed because of the erratic behavior that addiction creates. Also, you always run the risk of being arrested when you use illegal drugs. These are all things that could change when you stop using meth.
Prolonged use of meth can cause negative health consequences such as extreme weight loss, severe dental problems including tooth loss, and skin sores that result from excessive scratching. Meth use can also increase the risk of contracting infectious diseases such as HIV and Hepatitis.Being healthy for you and your family is often a pretty good reason to quit.;
, Be intentional about removing the people who introduced you to the drugs from your life altogether.This includes old friends that you have gotten high with in the past as well as your drug supplier. You should remove any avenue that you could potentially use to contact them. This includes phone numbers that are stored in your cell phone, phone numbers that may be written down on pieces of paper in your wallet or in your home, and even social media contacts. This way you will no longer have access to people who have a negative influence on you.


If negative influences are still contacting you, then you may want to consider changing your phone number and deleting your social media accounts for a while.
It is just as important to avoid going into old environments that may trigger your desire to use meth. Many people even take alternate routes to work to avoid driving past old acquaintances.

, Staying busy can also help you avoid negative influences. Try getting a job and even a second one if possible. Experiment with working longer hours or get started with a new hobby. Try to keep yourself busy so that you’re less likely to be distracted by negative people and places.

, It is really important to have a strong support system as you move through the process of quitting meth. There should be at least one person who you can call at any time to help you get through a tough moment.


Keep your sobriety partner’s phone number in your wallet, in your cell phone, or in any place where you will have easy access to it at all times.
Identifying one person to be your sobriety partner is fantastic but having several people that you can call at a moment’s notice is ideal. Keep in mind that the larger your support network is, the more successful you’ll be with quitting.

, You may want to involve a family member or friend in this process so that you can make sure that you get all of the details that you need. Making an informed decision is important.


You may want to look at your plan’s brochure or schedule of benefits before actually contacting the insurance company. These written insurance materials should also have details about what is covered in your plan.
If you don’t have insurance then treatment may be a little more difficult to obtain. However it is important to figure out how you are going to pay for your treatment. There are many social service programs that may be helpful. In addition, family and friends may be willing to assist financially so that you can get help.

, In general, the difference between the two treatment options is the level of intensity.Although both types can offer effective treatment programs, inpatient services tend to be more intense. Inpatient programs allow you to live at the facility with other people who are recovering from addictions and participate in daily meetings and support groups. Outpatient programs generally include counseling and monitoring but are not as intense as inpatient facilities.


Consider how severe your addiction is when deciding what type of treatment to undergo. If the addiction is severe and you are concerned that remaining at home while in treatment will result in you dropping out of the program, then an inpatient program is probably your best option.
If the addiction is not extremely severe and you have other responsibilities like a job or children, you may want to consider an outpatient program.
When making this decision you may want to asking for feedback from family members and other people who care about you. They may be able to see the situation a little more objectively.
If you choose inpatient treatment, try to visit the facility in advance so that you are comfortable with where you will be living for the next few weeks or months.

, Be sure to tidy things up before you begin treatment. If you will be in inpatient treatment, talk to your supervisor about having time off from work so that your job can still be in place when you return. Even if you are in outpatient treatment, you may want to take a couple of days off, particularly at the beginning as you begin the process of sober living. This way, your work performance won’t be jeopardized. Also, if you are a mother (or father) of small children, you will need to arrange for childcare if you are unmarried and write lots of lists for your partner if you are married.


It may take up to 90 days to complete treatment.Sometimes it may even be longer, depending upon the severity of the addiction and your specific needs. However, you must be committed to the process and that includes preparing in advance for success. Remember, when you complete the program, you should have all of the tools that you need to stay substance free.
You may not want to take too much time off from work if you are in outpatient treatment. Work is a way to stay busy and distracted.

, When you finally make the decision to pursue treatment, irrational fears and old thinking habits will try to creep back in. A great way to move past the fear is to use visualization.Try visualizing a huge multi-room mansion. You don’t know what’s in the rooms up ahead but you visualize that you’re taking the first step in faith. As you use this strategy, remind yourself that what’s ahead of you in the mansion is good for you and know that you’ll find the courage that you need to make it through the whole mansion. When the fear presents itself, gently remind yourself that you are doing the best thing possible for yourself by entering treatment.

, Overcoming a meth addiction use can be a very hard process, so it is very important to have a solid support system in place. Do not try to go through this process alone. Here are a couple of ways that you can get the support that you need:Rely on close family members and friends. If you’re reluctant to ask for support again because you’ve let them down in the past, consider going to family counseling. It’s very important that you have the support of those closest to you during this time.
Make new friends. You can find healthy people engaged in constructive activities in places like church, civics groups, volunteer activities, school, classes, or events being held in your community.
If you live alone or in a place where you readily have access to Meth or other drugs, consider moving into a drug-free living environment during outpatient treatment. This is also a good option to consider after you leave inpatient treatment. You’ll have more support in a healthier living environment.

, This may sound simpler than it is in reality, especially if you are in an outpatient program. When withdrawal symptoms emerge at the beginning, you may want to avoid the discomfort. Similarly, when you start to feel better toward the end of treatment, you may feel like you no longer need treatment. During these times, you may tempted to stop going to your sessions or discontinue inpatient treatment. However, that would not be a wise decision and will likely be detrimental to your success.


Inpatient treatment is very structured and at times it may even seem like it is beneath you to attend the sessions. In addition, the other people in treatment may be extremely vocal or have personalities that don’t match well with yours. When these frustrations arise, continue to remind yourself that this is only temporary and the end results are worth it.
Rely on your support system during these times to keep you motivated. The moment that the thought “Don’t go today” creeps up into your mind, immediately call your accountability partner or other supportive person.

, It is imperative that you not only go to every meeting but that you also fully participate in the treatment that is offered. Get involved in the dialogue, do homework assignments, and make it a priority to get the most out of each session. There are various types of treatment options that may be provided:Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) helps you identify the factors that are contributing to your drug use and give you strategies to overcome them.
Multidimensional Family Therapy (MFT) is often used with adolescents to help youth and their families address the abuse patterns and improve overall functioning within the family unit.
Motivational incentives use behavioral reinforcement to encourage drug abstinence.

, Detoxification is the first step in treatment and the process will allow your body to rid itself of the drug.Be prepared to experience withdrawal symptoms during the first few days that you’re in treatment.These symptoms don’t feel good but they’re only temporary. Remind yourself that once you’ve made it through the first few days, that they will subside and you’ll feel better.


Long gone are the days when you have to go cold turkey and sit in treatment writhing in agony. Typically, medicine is used to help ease the withdrawal symptoms. So, although you will likely experience some of the physical symptoms of detoxing and withdrawal, they probably won’t be extreme.
Medication such as methadone, buprenorphine and, and naltrexone are often used to relieve meth cravings so that you can disengage from drug seeking and focus on treatment.
Some withdrawal symptoms that you may experience include difficulties breathing, diarrhea, shaking, paranoia, mood shifts, sweating, heart palpitations, vomiting, and nausea. Again, keep in mind that medications will help ease these symptoms.
Meth is a amphetamine that results in the increase in dopamine production. Dopamine signals the brain to “feel good” and when a person stops taking meth the dopamine levels drop drastically. As a result, you may experience anhedonia or an inability to experience pleasure.This temporary condition usually lasts for a few weeks while the body readjusts its dopamine levels. Unfortunately, people often relapse during this time because they want to feel good again. Therefore, it’s important to recognize when this condition is occurring so that you don't drop out of treatment.
In the beginning, the physical and emotional withdrawal symptoms may feel overwhelming and cause you to want to stop treatment. Discontinuing treatment is not a wise idea and could be detrimental to your success.

, Take time to really embrace your treatment. Remember to verbally congratulate yourself for having the courage to get better for yourself and your family.

, When leaving an inpatient program, you may want to first consider spending time in a recovery home. These homes are often referred to as sober-living homes or halfway houses. They can help bridge the gap between inpatient facilities and the outside world. You can learn more about relapse prevention in these homes before returning directly back to your old environment.These programs are often privately owned and can be expensive. Again, you may want to check to see if your insurance covers such programs. Other options are asking for financial assistance from social services, your church or local ministry, or arrange to pay out of pocket.

, This should be a priority and should be done as soon as your treatment is complete. In fact, it might be helpful to have one available before treatment even ends so that you can hop right in without delay. Joining a support group is extremely important in order to avoid relapse. Check to see if there is a local Crystal Meth Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous group that you can join. You can also get referrals from a physician, friend, or social service organization.


Spending time around other people who are in recovery in a supportive environment will help you when you reintegrate into your normal routine.
Attending a support group even if you are in a recovery home is very important. This way you’ll already be used to it when you return home.
Now that you feel better, other things will begin to compete for your attention again. During this transition, you may think that it’s okay to begin skipping meetings. Skipping support group meetings is not a wise idea and could be detrimental to your success.

, When you are in recovery, you still want to avoid friends and places that you used to spend time around when you were using meth. These people and environments will likely still be strong triggers for you. Therefore, avoiding them is especially important in the first few years of your recovery. Here are other ways to avoid triggers that could result in relapse:Avoid bars and clubs. Even if you don’t struggle with alcohol, alcohol can lower inhibitions and impair judgment. Also, you may be more likely to run into old buddies there or be in the presence of meth.
The use of opiates and other prescription medication can trigger relapse but so can inadequate pain relief.Therefore it's important for you to be candid with doctors when seeking medical treatment. Do not be ashamed of your history and instead focus on avoiding relapse. If you need a medical or dental procedure, find a medical professional who will provide alternative medicines or prescribe the minimal amount of medication to provide you comfort but not trigger a relapse.

, Stress may trigger cravings for you yet it is impossible to avoid all stress. Therefore, it’s important to know how to manage the stress so that it does not become overwhelming and cause you to relapse. Here are some things that you can do to relieve stress:Exercise: Walking, running, biking, gardening, swimming, even cleaning your house helps.
Write: Spend 10-15 minutes a day writing about stressful events that happened that day. It might help if after you write about the event that you rewrite the ending the way you would have liked for things to have gone. Write in the present tense, pretending as if it really happened that way. This way you end the writing exercise on a positive note.
Talk it out: Whether you want to laugh, cry, or just vent a little, find a friend, Counselor or Clergyman who is available to be present and talk it out with you.
Do something you enjoy: Find an activity that you really enjoy and spend some time doing that. It could be anything healthy that you enjoy, such as gardening, playing with your kids, going for a stroll, eating out, baking, or even just sitting outside in the fresh air for a while. If you enjoy it and it’s a healthy activity, then go for it.
Meditate: Sit in a quiet place and breather in deeply through your nose and allow the air to go to your abdomen. Then breathe out through your mouth allowing the air to come up from your abdomen and out of your mouth. As you do this, focus on the breaths that you take. This is a great meditation process for stress relief.
Yoga: Enroll into a yoga class or grab a few yoga DVDs to help with stress relief.

, Sometimes the cravings come hard and heavy, regardless of what you do. Therefore it is important to know exactly what to do when this occurs. Here are some great coping techniques that should be a part of your plan:Have productive thoughts while dealing with cravings. Tell yourself that it's a craving. Cravings are bound to happen, and dealing with the cravings will get easier all the time. Think, ""I need to ride out my cravings, one at a time so I can remain sober"".
Keep a list of activities that you enjoy that can help distract you when the urge to use emerges. Some examples of distracting activities might include reading, writing in your journal, going to the movies, watching a movie at home, or going out to eat.
Visualize that you’re a surfer who is determined to ride the wave until the craving passes. See yourself staying on top of the wave until it crests, peaks, and then returns to the less powerful, white and foamy surf. This technique is called “urge surfing.”
List all of the benefits and consequences of using meth on an index card that you keep on you at all times. When a craving hits, pull out the card to remind yourself that you really won’t feel better if you use.
Call your accountability partner or other supportive friend or family member so that you can talk through the urge.

, Goals are often a great drug prevention tool. When you are focused on achieving your goals, you are less likely to revert back to meth use. It doesn’t matter what the goals are – they can be focused on family, career, or even personal goals like completing a marathon or writing your first book. Just make sure that the goals that you choose are important to you.

, Call your sobriety partner, Therapist, Clergyman, go to a meeting, or schedule an appointment with your doctor as quickly as you can. The goal is to get back on track and out of danger as soon as possible.


Relapse is a common part of the recovery process. Don’t let it keep you down. Rather than look at it as failure, use it as a learning opportunity. When you are sober again, take a look at what triggered your relapse and figure out what you can do the next time a similar situation presents itself.

, After you have been in recovery for some time, you may decide that you want to educate the public or help others through their own recovery process. In fact, many people consider volunteering to be an essential part of their own recovery process.Becoming a role model or mentor is a great way to help others with their addictions. It can also help you maintain sobriety yourself as well as improve your own self-esteem. Volunteers also benefit from reduced rates of depression and an increased sense of life satisfaction and well being.


As you’re making your list, consider the types of people whom you would like to work with. Whatever your preferences are, make sure that you are clear about them in your mind before you agree to volunteer.
Some things to consider when choosing the place where you will volunteer include age and gender of participants. Some people might prefer to educate youth while others may prefer to provide support for a specific gender.

, After you have developed a list of potential places to volunteer, now it is time to review the requirements for each organization. Some programs have stricter guidelines than others, particularly if you desire to mentor youth. If you meet the volunteer requirements then keep the organization on your list. If not, then cross it off and move on to the next.


Be sure that the volunteer opportunity is a good fit for you. For example, if you just want to volunteer once per month then make sure that the guidelines don’t expect weekly contact.

, Sometimes the organizations already have a formal volunteer program and you’ll probably just need to fill out an application and wait to be contacted. Other times, particularly if you’d like to talk to students in a school setting, you will probably need to call the organizational head to see if you could volunteer there.


You can usually find contact information on the website. You can call the contact person or send them a quick email.

, After you have arranged to provide services as a mentor you may start to experience some anxiety or fear. Anxiety is a normal reaction to any stressful event.Therefore its not unusual to be a little nervous before doing something new. However, try to stay motivated by reminding yourself that following through will help other people learn the tools that they need to have a better life. Here are a few other things that may help decrease your nervousness:


Get adequate rest the night before you volunteer. Sleep deprivation can increase your level of anxiety so be sure to go to bed at a reasonable hour.
Try not to ruminate or think excessively about the upcoming volunteer assignment. Focus your thoughts on preparing for the event and then spend the rest of the time engaged in other healthy activities.
Confront your fears. Try starting with activities that cause you lower levels of anxiety. Continue to engage in the activities until the anxiety no longer occurs. Try activities that are slightly uncomfortable but simple, like spooning soup into bowls at a soup kitchen. When you're comfortable with that then you can move up to other volunteer activities.

Be aware of inequalities in leg length.,

Get an evaluation done before buying runners.,
Get a pair of custom made orthotics.",How to Choose Shoes to Help Reduce Your Back Pain," Schedule an appointment with your family physician if you develop back pain that won't go away after a few days of taking it easy. Your doctor will examine your back (spine) and likely ask you about your family history, job and lifestyle. If your back pain is severe, then x-rays of your spine might also be taken. Your doctor will try to rule out the most serious causes of back pain, such as a herniated disk, spinal infection, bone fracture, arthritis and cancer. Once those are ruled out, then considering how your posture, foot shape and shoe choices may be causing your back pain is appropriate.


Your family doctor is very likely not a back or spine specialist, so consider seeing an osteopath or chiropractor to diagnose your back pain as an alternative approach.
Signs accompanying back pain that indicate you should immediately seek medical care include: muscle weakness and/or loss of sensations in your arms or legs, loss of bladder or bowel control, fever, sudden weight loss.;
, After you understand your back pain is not caused by a serious condition or disease, then look at your feet (particularly your arches) for a possible connection. Flat feet are a common contributor to back pain, especially for people on their feet frequently, because arches act as shock absorbers and prevent force from being translated up to other joints of the body.A good objective test to see if you have flat feet is the ""wet feet"" test.Dampen the bottoms of your feet with water and walk across a large piece of cardboard or thick paper that clearly shows your wet footprints. Make sure to get prints of both feet and examine them closely.


A foot with a healthy arch will leave a heel print connected to the front forefoot by a strip about 1/2 the width of the foot on the outside of the sole. If you have flat feet, you'll see a print that reflects the entire underside of your foot with no space between the forefoot and heel.
Both feet usually leave very similar footprints, but in some cases differences exist due to previous foot / ankle injuries or leg length differences.
A 2013 study revealed that American women with flat feet are 50% more likely than those with normal or high arches to develop low back pain., Looking at your posture in a full-length mirror is another good method to gauge if the shape or positioning of your feet, ankles and knees is potentially contributing to your back pain. While wearing shorts and standing straight, look at the angles of your feet, legs and ankles. If your feet point outwards, your ankles roll in (termed over-pronation) and/or your knees are close together or touch (termed genu valgum) then you are at much greater risk for back pain because these postures put more strain on the hips and lower spine.People who are overweight tend to have all three postural issues, which partially explains why back pain is much more common in obese people.


Over-pronation of the ankle, flat feet and genu valgum are sometimes hereditary (genetics control physiological development), but in many cases they are the result of the body carrying far too much weight.
For reference, if your legs look fairly straight (at least a few inches between your knees), your ankles appear in a neutral position and don't collapse inwards (medially) and you can fit a few fingers underneath your feet while weight bearing, then likely other issues are causing or contributing to your back pain.

, It's actually quite common to have one leg that is longer than the other – according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, one study found that 32% of 600 military recruits had a 1/5 inch to a 3/5 inch difference between the lengths of their legs.However, any difference in length greater than this can have serious affects on your health, which may include lower back pain.Correcting a leg length inequality is easy to do with a shoe insert. It’s also inexpensive and can easily be stopped if no changes are seen. A foot doctor or health professional trained in assessing and treating the foot is the best option to assess your need for a shoe insert., For further clues as to the cause of your back pain, take a good look at the soles of your most commonly worn shoes. For people with normal posture and biomechanics while walking, their heels strike the ground slightly on the outside or lateral edge, which causes wear on that area of their soles.If the soles of your shoes appear to be worn directly in the middle of the heel area — or worse, on the inside or medial edge — then you likely pronate too much at the ankle while walking. As noted above, over-pronation and flat feet often go hand-in-hand and significantly increase the risk of knee problems, hip issues and low back pain.


Wear patterns are easier to notice on well-used running shoes with rubber soles because they wear down quicker while walking / running on asphalt and cement.
Keep in mind that wear patterns on the extreme outside (lateral) edge of the heels area indicate too much rigidity in your ankles and/or arches of your feet (termed over-supination). However, this type of posture is not linked to back pain nearly to the extent that over-pronation / flat feet are., A significant number of people wear shoes that don't fit well, perhaps because the shoes were on sale or they're hand-me-downs, or various other reasons. Regardless, always wear shoes that properly fit your feet, not just in terms of length, but also in terms of width. Wearing shoes that don't fit not only cause blisters, bunions and calluses, but they can reduce the stability and compromise the biomechanics of your feet and subsequently trigger back pain and other joint issues.


Get fitted for shoes later in the day because that's when your feet are a little larger, usually due to swelling and slight compression of your arches.
Most off-the-shelf shoes are regular (medium) width, so you may have to order shoes from the manufacturer if your feet are really narrow or wide.
Some footwear may fit well, such as flip-flops, but they can still cause foot and other musculoskeletal problems due to the lack of arch and heel support., Regardless if you have flat feet or not, wearing shoes with strong arch support is going to benefit your feet and improve your gait during walking / running at the very least. Wearing more supportive shoes may also significantly reduce your back pain or relieve the symptoms entirely, depending on its cause.As such, when buying new shoes, look for a comfortable walking or athletic shoe with substantial arch support, roomy toe box, firm heel counter and a flexible sole. Buy quality and avoid trendy styles that look flimsy.


Wearing flat sandals, flip flops and other slip-ons on the beach or around the pool is likely okay, but they shouldn't be used for extensive walking or any kind of exercise.Avoid shoes with heels higher than two inches because it changes the center of gravity and causes strain on the lower back.However, wearing completely level shoes may put too much pressure on your heels, so consider buying shoes that are elevated in the heel by about 1/4 or 1/2 inch.

, If you are a regular jogger and think that your feet, shoes or running style may be causing your back pain, then get an evaluation done at a reputable running store. High-end running stores often employ people who are qualified to assess your gait, examine your feet and check the wear patterns on your shoes. These employees are not doctors, but they are usually experienced runners who can give you sound advice on what types of running shoes to buy, which can make a positive impact on your back pain. If you're a serious runner, you should be replacing your shoes every 350 to 500 miles or 3 months, whichever comes first.You may be asked to run over a force plate that's hooked up to a computer, or get video-taped jogging on a treadmill as part of your assessment.
If you're an over-pronator, shoes with lots of medial support in the arch will likely be recommended to prevent ankle collapse. If you're an over-supinator, then more lateral (outside) support is needed to force your foot into a neutral position.
Make sure the rigidity of the heel counter (back of the shoe) is vertical and not tilting to one side or the other.Shock absorption is also important for running shoes, which is why many brands have air pockets within the soles.

, If you have flat feet and over-pronate, then you may be better off with custom shoe orthotics instead of new shoes. Orthotics are semi-rigid shoe inserts that support the arch of your foot and promote better biomechanics while standing, walking and running.By providing cushioning and some shock absorption, orthotics will also reduce the likelihood of problems developing in other joints such as your ankles, knees, hips and spine. Health professionals who make custom orthotics include podiatrists, as well as some osteopaths, chiropractors, physicians and physical therapists.


You should realize that orthotics don't reverse any structural deformities of the foot nor can they reconstruct an arch by wearing them over time.
When wearing orthotics, you'll likely need to take the factory insoles out of your shoes first.
Custom orthotics can be expensive without medical coverage, but off-the-shelf insoles may provide relief for back pain also.

Make milk toast.,
Eat a banana.,
Cut up a papaya.,
Eat the CRAP diet.",How to Cure a Morning Stomach Ache1," When your stomach hurts first thing in the morning, you may need to try to eat something that isn't going to upset your stomach even more. Food rich in starch, such as rice, potatoes, and oats, can help calm your stomach. Starches don't sit in your stomach for a long period of time and they don't stimulate acid reflux, which can make your stomach feel worse.


Try eating a bowl of oatmeal, a bowl of rice, or grits. This can help sooth your stomach and hopefully make your stomach ache go away.You can also try dry toast. Avoid eating jams, jellies, or butter on the toast. Those things may cause your stomach to react and make your ache much worse.If you are feeling extremely nauseous, you can try saltine crackers. They are really basic and there isn't much to them. Eating them helps absorb stomach acid and relieve aches.;
, Improper digestion is a common cause of stomach aches. In order to get your digestion moving again, you can eat yogurt to get it going. Try a type of yogurt with live cultures to help flush bad bacteria out of your system, which will help alleviate your stomach ache.


Yogurt also helps with indigestion, which can also contribute to stomach pain.Greek yogurt with a little bit of honey is a great breakfast to help ease your stomach and get your day started.

, Applesauce is a great food to eat when your stomach is upset. it can sooth your stomach because it is starchy and has low acidity. It is also easily digestible. If you are suffering from diarrhea, it can help ease your symptoms. Try a small bowl of it for breakfast to help alleviate your stomach ache.


It is also high in fiber, which can help with a stomach ache related to constipation.

, Morning stomach aches may be caused by a general case of an uneasy stomach. Two of the best things for an uneasy stomach are milk and bread. While the components alone may irritate your stomach, making milk toast has the added benefit of the coating qualities of milk and the absorbing qualities of the bread without irritating your stomach. To make this, warm 1 cup of milk in a saucepan and pour it into a cereal bowl. Toast 1 piece of break and put a little bit of unsalted butter on top. Crumble the toast into the milk and eat slowly.


Make sure your milk is not boiling. It will make it hard to eat.You can also use cornbread instead of toast. Crumble the cornbread into cold or warm milk and eat it like cereal.

, Bananas have been used for generations to soothe stomachs. They contain potassium, which helps with dehydration and irritated stomachs. They also have natural sugars, which can help relieve any hunger pangs related to early morning stomach aches.


The plus side is that they are not too sweet, which can often cause stomach aches to get worse., Although bland foods are commonly suggested when you have a stomach ache, you can try some papaya for breakfast to help alleviate your stomach issues. It is rich in the enzymes papain and chymopapain, which help lower acidity and break down proteins in your stomach.


Papaya will also help with constipation, encourage digestions, and ease indigestion.

, Although the name is kind of vulgar, this diet plan actually works to help alleviate stomach troubles. The abbreviation stands for cherries, raisins, apricots, and prunes. The diet suggests you eat these fruits due to their high levels of fiber. The increased fiber will help with your digestion, help flush out your system, and make you feel better.


You can also eat these fruits dried. Make sure you get the versions with no added sugars. The extra added sugar can end up aggravating your stomach more than helping it.
Taking soluble fiber or pills may also help.

",How to Reduce Chronic Pain," 50% of pain can be reduced by relaxation. Tension and stress will increase pain. Practice relaxation--it is a learned skill for most people.;
, Long, slow and focused breathing helps relaxation and takes attention away from pain.

, Use intense stimulation (e.g., loud music) for temporary relief from pain.

, Maintain contact with enjoyable people. Spend time interacting with pets (a dog or cat). Don’t allow your life to become a monotonous daily routine; do new and different things every day. Do things for other people. Learn something new every day.

, Learn about these methods. Get training in self-hypnosis. Practice intense daydreaming. Go to a biofeedback therapist, get training, and buy your own equipment.


Meditation is a particularly useful technique that has been shown to reduce pain. In fact, a study has shown that meditating for 20 minutes four times a day reduced pain intensity by 40%, and reduced the unpleasantness of the pain by a whopping 57% .

, Take enough medication, often enough to control YOUR pain. Learn about analgesics (pain medications). Antidepressants should be considered by most chronic pain patients. Be careful about using tranquilizers--they are habit-forming and become less effective over time.

, Acupuncture, massage, and electrical stimulation through a TENS unit are often helpful. Consult professionals who work in these procedures.

, Ice can reduce pain for hours. You can also use ice on contra-lateral side of the body--that is, the opposite side of the body where the pain is experienced (ice the left hand, if you have intense pain in the right hand).

, Don't suffer alone. Go to social events that you enjoy (music, church, political meetings); stay in contact with your family and friends (send everyone a positive email everyday).

, Keep your life positive: surround yourself with positive ideas and people. Involve yourself in your religion if that it is important to you. Study psychology and learn about how the mind can be used to control feelings and perceptions.

, Train yourself to be the best expert about your health. Learn about any disease that you have and stay current on treatment developments.

, Don't indulge in excesses such as tobacco, too much alcohol or over-eating.

, It may be very helpful to consult with a physician who specializes in pain management. If such a specialist is not available in your community, consult with an anesthesiologist. Also consult with a physical therapist, a health psychologist, or a nurse who specializes in pain treatment. Have you considered an acupuncturist or a practitioner of Chinese medicine? Supportive psychotherapy with a health psychologist is sometimes helpful.

, Don't stay with the same practitioner if you feel they are discouraged and uninterested in helping you. Health providers are only human, each has their own personal limitations. Don't hesitate to ask for referrals to other experts. Some practitioners do not work well with chronic pain patients--don't let your practitioner get you into a negative thinking.

Drink water.,
Make ginger tea.,
Brew chamomile tea.,
Try coconut water.,
Mix a baking soda solution.,
Make an apple cider vinegar drink.",How to Cure a Morning Stomach Ache2," One reason that you might wake up with a stomach ache is that you are thirsty. Dehydration can cause a stomach ache and since you have just gone all night without water, you may be slightly dehydrated. Pour yourself a glass of water and drink it slowly. You don't want to drink it too fast and shock your empty stomach.


You can also add lemon to it as well. It can help calm any stomach irritation caused by the dehydration.
You can also try to drink juice or a sports drink to help replenish any nutrients or electrolytes that you might be missing., If you wake up with pains in your stomach, you may need something to calm your stomach down. Ginger, whether it is in tea, raw, or in ginger ale, can help calm your stomach and make it feel better. It promotes the release of enzymes that help neutralize stomach acid and contains phenols that relax the stomach muscles and irritated tissues. One of the best ways to get pure ginger is by making a homemade ginger tea.


To make the tea, start with 2 inch piece of ginger root and water. Peel and cut the ginger root into small pieces, then crush the pieces into even smaller bits. Boil 2-3 cups of water and add the ginger once it's boiling. Let it boil for 3-5 minutes. Remove it from heat. You can strain the ginger out when they pour it into a mug if you want or you can leave it in and drink it along with the tea. You can also drizzle some honey in it to make it sweeter.
You can simply eat ginger if you prefer that to drinking the homemade tea., Chamomile tea is a great way to soothe your stomach. The chamomile in the tea helps reduce inflammation, which can help relax the muscles in your stomach that are contributing to the ache. If you are not a fan of chamomile, you can brew most herbal teas to help with stomach issues.


Steer clear of peppermint tea. It ca relax certain parts of your esophageal sphincter, which leads to heartburn and acid reflux., Unlike normal water, coconut water contains electrolytes and natural nutrients that can help alleviate stomach pain. The water contains natural sugars that will give you calories to give you energy as well as potassium and vitamin C.


Make sure you get 100% pure coconut water.You don't want any of the artificial ingredients that may make your stomach ache even worse.

, Baking soda is great for a stomach ache because it helps neutralize stomach acid, which causes pain. Many over the counter medications contain baking soda, but you can make your own home solution to ease your stomach pain. Add a tablespoon of baking soda to 1 cup of water. Stir it well and then drink it.


You can warm the water if your want, but it isn't necessary., Unlike other kinds of vinegar, apple cider vinegar is rich in nutrients that can help alleviate your stomach ache in the morning. It also has helpful bacteria and enzymes that will alleviate digestive disruption, help indigestion, and reduce cramps.


Mix apple cider vinegar with water and honey and stir. Drink it all to help alleviate your stomach ache.

Use heat.,
Try reflexology.,
Take over the counter medications.,
Seek medical help.",How to Cure a Morning Stomach Ache3," If you wake up feeling like you need to throw up, let yourself vomit. It may be that you body consumed something that it needs to expel, so listen to the way your body feels and do what is best for your body. It is never pleasant to vomit, but in the end, your stomach will likely feel better.


Holding it in can damage your esophagus because the stomach acid is just sitting in your throat., One reason you may have a morning stomach ache is because you are anxious about something. If you know you are worrying too much about something, try to calm yourself. Anxiety often causes nausea and stomach aches, so relieving your own anxiety can often make the harsh feeling of your stomach in knots go away. Try to acknowledge the anxiety and let go of whatever is bothering you.


Try meditating or even breathing. This can help your muscles relax and make you feel better overall., You may wake up with a stomach ache because of muscle tightness all over your body. This can happen due to a strange sleeping position or over exertion the day before. To alleviate this, lie flat on your stomach on a flat, solid surface. Push your arms up, lifting just your upper body and arching your back toward the ceiling. This will stretch out your back and release the muscles in your abdomen as well.


To exercise your neck, tip your head forward and touch your chin to your chest, holding for 10-15 seconds. Next, tip your head to either side and hold your ear toward your shoulder, holding for 10-15 seconds. Repeat on the other side., You can use a hot water bottle or a heating pad to help alleviate the pain in your stomach. Lie flat on your back and lay the bottle or pad across your stomach. The heat will increase the blood flow to the skin surface. This helps lower the feelings of pain from underneath the abdomen.They also make heat patches that may work. You can buy them at your local pharmacy or general store.

, There is a method called reflexology that uses the nerves in the body to help relax other areas of the body. In this practice, the nerves in the left foot correspond to the stomach. To use this technique, grab your left foot with the palm of your right hand. Push under the ball of the foot with your left hand and apply a steady, even pressure with your thumb. After a few seconds, release the pressure and move up a little bit, repeating the motion.


After you reach the top of the arch with your left thumb, come back down the foot with the right thumb, applying the same pressure until you reach the bottom area of your foot.
If you can't get it right by yourself, have someone else rub the area for you. You may not be able to properly relax if you are doing it to yourself., There are some useful over the counter treatments that can be helpful for a stomach ache. You can try medicines such as Pepto-Bismol or Imodium if you feel overly nauseous or have diarrhea. If your stomach pain is more related to indigestion or acid reflux, you can try medications with ranitidine in them, such as Zantac. Avoid taking aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen sodium as because they may make your stomach pain worse.Make sure you follow the dosing instructions for these medications. If you are curious about any issues that may arise from taking them, ask your doctor.

, If your stomach ache persists for more than one or two mornings, you should see a doctor to check for any underlying conditions. You should also see a doctor if you try a few remedies and your stomach ache gets worse.


You never want to put yourself in danger waiting for remedies to work on an issue that may have a more serious cause.

Read up on the What's Hot Column.,
Out with the Old, in with the New.,
Shopping is a CB Fashionista's Best Friend.,
Don't judge a book by its cover.,
Don't forget about moi!,
Sometimes it's about how you present yourself.",How to Become a Club Banana Fashionista," First and foremost, go to your local store or a book store to buy the latest issues of teen fashion magazines. Take some time when you get home to carefully read over every article relating to fashion and beauty. You can't become a CB Fashionista if you don't what's hot and what's not. So instead of watching that re-run on tv, chill out in a quiet place, grab your new mags and study, study, study! Then, join the lesbian club.;
, Now it's time go through your wardrobe and select items that were considered not in style (according to the magazines) and put them in a box or bag to give away to Goodwill or Salvation Army. If it's tattered or in bad condition, consider throwing it away. If you have barely used the clothing consider going to Plato's Closet because they take gently-used clothing from people and give you cash in exchange.

, From this point on, shopping will be your new best friend so find a time most convenient for your parents to take you to the mall or a few boutiques to go shopping. Not everyone can just buy clothes like that, so consider buying a few pieces at a time or ask your parents if you can do a few chores for cash. There are several things you could do to get money and all you need to do is think. If you're an older teen, then you could work at a fashion store at the mall and that's an excellent way to stay in tune with the latest fashions. Anyway, while shopping look for things that were considered 'hot' by those fashion articles!

, As if!. Society is so hypocritical these days because everyone knows we judge people on something. So how you look and smell is crucial. Not only should you keep up with the latest fashions, but your beauty and scent need to be 'du jour' too. Try not to use so much make-up, because it is tacky and makes you look cheap. The main make-up you should be using is mascara, lip-gloss/stick, (shimmer) eye shadow, maybe eye liner and a little blush. You don't need foundation, bronzer or concealer unless your skin is discolored, but otherwise if you have blemishes/acne then it doesn't count because a true CB Fashionista has clean blemish-free skin so try to catch up on a regular facial-cleansing routine to get that all natural glow. For your scent, choose something that you find irresistible, sweet and it has to be something that everyone wants but can't have!

, Beauty is also about hair, nails and personal hygiene so use these tips to keep yourself stylish and fresh.




Whether you have curly, wavy or straight hair, always keep it shampooed, conditioned and moisturized. Nothing is more disgusting then seeing dried-up, dirty, unkempt hair! There are specific brands that treat your specific needs like volumizing for thin, ultra-straight hair or even something to keep the frizzies down! No matter what keep it clean and healthy then you can style it as a CB fashionista would. Sometimes fashion magazines have hairstyles you can try-out so study up!
Nails can be polished with whatever the latest color is as long as they are always clean and trimmed. You can do neon pink, banana yellow or even black as long as they are neat and clean.
As far as personal hygiene is concerned, make sure you brush your teeth twice a day and take showers/baths at least once a day! A CB Fashionista always wants to smell fresh!



, You can have all the latest clothing and accessories in the world, but have low self-confidence or low self-esteem and make the outfit look horrible. I'm not saying that image is nothing, but it's not the only thing. When you walk into a room with a smile and your head up it says a lot to people of what kind of person you are. When you give a handshake, and if it is firm that tells people that you are sure of yourself and confident. Being confident means just showing others that you know who you are, where you are going and you are going to be. And you can even put a CB Fashionista twist on confidence and when someone tries to strike up a conversation with you, mention the current events in fashion and you never know...you could have yourself a new CB Fashionista BFF!

Visit a physical therapist.",How to Remove Muscle Knots1," Some muscle knots hurt without pressure, so they're easy to identify. Others don't hurt until you apply pressure. Using your fingers, gently probe your muscles looking for pressure points. You may feel a knot or bump in the muscle. Many people have muscle knots in the top half of their backs, so that is a good place to begin., These experts are trained in muscle therapy and know the best techniques for relieving knotted muscles. Their approach will be to apply compression to the muscle and the area surrounding it. They understand how this process affects the surrounding tissues and the rest of your body., Professional massages can be expensive, especially if you need to visit one regularly. An alternative is to learn massage techniques you can use on yourself. Squeeze the muscles gently, and rub them in a circular motion. Do this action all over your body, even on muscles you do not think have knots to make your whole body feel better.


A variety of massage tools and pain relief creams are available to assist with your personal massage regime. One method is to roll a tennis ball around the area while applying light pressure until you feel slight pain in the muscle knot. Using pressure, hold the ball in place for 30 seconds. Follow this procedure with other knotted muscles.

, Temperature therapy relaxes the affected area.A heating pad or cold compress can alleviate some of the pain that is associated with muscle knots.
Use a cooling spray in coordination with stretching. , A warm bath helps you and your knotted muscles to relax. For added healing, stir Epsom salts into the water. A hot shower can help but isn't as effective. Stand so the water stream is focused on the muscles that are bothering you. You can also try a hot tub.

, Stretching keeps muscles flexible. Consider beginning tai chi or yoga, which combines relaxation with stretching.

, Exercise affects muscles similarly to the way massage therapy does. Exercising regularly stretches the muscles and maintains their flexibility, working out tension.Aerobic exercises are often good for relieving muscles pain, especially ones that work your shoulders, like swimming.Bikram yoga (hot yoga) offers the benefits of a hot bath with the added bonus of flexibility exercises. Make sure to follow warnings. That is, hydrate before starting and remember to stay hydrated. Avoid eating a large meal for 3 hours before the class; stick to light, easily digested foods that are good sources of electrolytes, such as bananas. During the class, if you feel cramping followed by lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, or weakness, leave the room at once and seek treatment for heat stroke. Most Bikram classes are 1.5 hours long. Speak with the instructor before your first class. If you are not accustomed to high temperatures, your goal for your first may be to stay in the studio for the full time rather than completing the exercises with the rest of the class.

, Hypnosis can help your muscles relax and can also assist with pain., With a physical therapist, you'll learn exercises that will help you strengthen and stretch your muscles. He or she can also help you adjust your lifestyle to prevent muscle knots."

, Exercise releases endorphins and promotes the production of neurotransmitters. This can be as simple as taking a brisk walk for 20 minutes, a yoga or Tai Chi class, Aquatic Aerobics, Basic Pilates, whatever you can do. It should be low impact and not endurance based. *(see tips)

, Pace yourself.

, If you feel you don't sleep well, tell your doctor. There are medications/treatments that can help. Deep uninterrupted sleep is required to replenish neurotransmitters and other needed elements that you use up during the day. *(see tips)

, If your hands hurt or are too weak to open a jar, find a tool or other way to do it. There are ALWAYS alternatives.

, You can be stronger longer if you know that at some point you don't need to be ""on"". That you will just be able to veg or take a nap for a short time.

, Some things tend to seem more overwhelming than they really are when you are in a lot of pain, or are just exhausted. Try to take a mental step back when you feel this way. Don't concentrate on the problem, seek the solution. Or just put it aside for a while and come back to it later.

, You may feel lousy, but you stick a smile on and greet everyone enthusiastically. They respond with a smile and maybe even laughter at your perky response. You allow yourself to giggle back. That makes you feel good. After a few people are startled into greeting you with a smile, you find you feel a little better. The longer you do this, the more true it becomes, until it is an integral part of your day. (It really works if you let it.)

, Life is made of stresses or else we would still just be wallowing in the mud somewhere and making no progress. However, you must learn to minimize it. We tend to make a lot of our own stresses.*(see tips) Learn methods of de-stressing such as meditation, yoga, listening to soothing music, aromatherapy, etc.

, Find ways of interjecting humor into your day. The more you smile and laugh, the more natural endorphins and healthy neurotransmitters your body will produce.

, Find information on your condition from doctors, healers, friends, websites, and support groups. Knowledge is power. Power is control over your own life. That control is the difference between living and merely surviving. *(see warnings)

, If a friendly slap on the shoulder makes you want to jump through the roof, let your friends and co-workers know that you would prefer a hug, or a high five, or just a ""Great to see you!"". Let your friends and co-workers know that your don't want them to ask you how you are feeling. Tell them you appreciate that they care about you, but that you don't want to be concentrating on that aspect of your life. *(see tips)

, It could be a song, a short poem, a quote, a combination of these or anything that has meaning for you.

Work on your work space.,
Check your posture.,
Pay attention to how you're positioned.,
Ask your friends and family for help.,
Try meditation.,
Relax consciously.,
Use a foam roller to ease muscle tension.,
Take your vitamins.,
Try cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).",How to Remove Muscle Knots2," Being hunched over a computer can increase muscle knots. Make sure your chair has proper back support and that your desk is at an appropriate height so that you aren't slouching while working. You can also try tools such as ergonomic keyboards to assist with correct posture., Sit up straight and stand up straight to help relieve muscle knots. Make sure you are not tensing your shoulders.Don't forget to check your posture even when you're involved in a project. Activities like leaning over tables or even sitting in chairs that don't give you enough back support can create muscle knots, too., For instance, you may not notice that you normally sit at a weird angle while watching television. Maybe you slump over to the left in the car. All of these can create muscle knots in your shoulders and back, so try to pay more attention to your position., The people you love can gently remind you when they notice you're slouching or in an awkward position.

, Meditation can help you be aware of your posture, as well as assist you with relaxing.

, When you notice you are tensing your shoulders, consciously relax them. Take a deep breath in, and slowly release it while you imagine breathing out the tension of your shoulders. Repeat as necessary.

, You can use a foam roller to release trigger points, or tight muscle knots. These areas can cause pain in an area of your body or even radiate pain to other areas, but using a foam roller can help to release these knots and restore your muscles to normal.To use a foam roller, place it on the ground and rest your body on it over the area where your muscles feel tight.

Use transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).,
Try an anti-inflammatory pain medication.,
Ask your doctor for an injection.",How to Remove Muscle Knots3," TENS uses low-volt electrical current to decrease pain, and these systems can be applied by your doctor or purchased at a drug store. You place two electrodes near the pain and the system applies a current., It will decrease the pain, as well as reduce any swelling in the area., Doctors can inject medications at trigger points to help relieve pain. Often, he or she will use a local anesthetic."
"
Know how melatonin works.,
Learn when to take melatonin.,
Recognize the side effects.,
Take different forms.,
Contact your doctor.",How to Take Melatonin1," Melatonin is a natural hormone produced by your pineal gland located in your brain. It acts like a neurotransmitter, or chemical messenger, to activate certain pathways in your brain. Its role in establishing a sleep cycle has been recognized; however, recent research indicates it may be involved in other body functions as well.


In the USA, melatonin is available over-the-counter as a dietary supplement and is therefore not regulated by the FDA. In most countries it is a prescription medication or it is unavailable.
Other sleeping aids generally present several problems such as building tolerance, which means they eventually becomes less effective and you have to increase the dose. In this regard, melatonin presents a better alternative because it is a natural hormone for which you don't build up a tolerance.;
, Melatonin can been used for circadian rhythm sleep disorders such as delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, which results in the inability to fall asleep before 2:00 am or later. It can also be used to help with sleep problems related to working night shifts, general insomnia, and jet lag.Generally, melatonin is safe to take in an appropriate amount, often 1 mg or less, to help with these issues. However, if your sleep problems are severe or persist, talk to your doctor first.
If you are on any other medications, you should also talk to your doctor before taking melatonin, as they may interact., There are some common side effects for melatonin. You may experience daytime sleepiness, headaches, or dizziness. There are also some less common side effects that you may experience. These include abdominal discomfort, mild anxiety, irritability, confusion and short-lasting feelings of depression.If you experience any persistent side effects, talk to your doctor.

, Melatonin comes in many forms. It comes in regular tablets or capsules. These can be time-release tablets, which slowly absorb into your body over a long period of time. These formulations may help with staying asleep during the night. You can also get sublingual, or quick dissolve, tablets, which dissolve under your tongue and go directly into your system instead of getting absorbed by your GI tract.This means the melatonin will act faster than regular tablets or capsules.


You can also get melatonin in liquid form. Similar to sublingual, the liquid form may be absorbed directly and will act faster than regular tablets or capsules.
Some pharmacies may also carry melatonin in other forms such as gummies, soft gels, or creams., When taking melatonin, you should contact your doctor if your insomnia persists or is affecting your daily activities. In addition, if you are on medications for diabetes, blood thinners, medications that suppress the immune system, blood pressure medications, medications to control seizures, or birth control pills, you should contact your doctor before taking melatonin."
"
Evaluate your sleep hygiene.,
Take melatonin at the correct time.,
Find the right dosage.,
Avoid certain behaviors.",How to Take Melatonin2," Your insomnia may be a result of your habits. Before trying any supplements, make sure you have good habits that facilitate sleep. This is called sleep hygiene. Good sleep hygiene includes going to bed and getting up the same time each day, avoiding alcohol and caffeine before bed, and turning off all the lights. You should also avoid stimulation before sleeping.


Activities that should be avoided are any that will overexcite you before bed, such as exercise, watching TV, or computer work.
You should also associate your bed with sleep. It is best if you don't read or do other work in bed so your body does not get used to doing anything but sleep in your bed.Try not to use electronics such as your phone or a tablet before bed. The blue light emitted by these devices can make it difficult for you to fall asleep.

, The time of day that you take melatonin is very important. If you take it because you have trouble staying asleep, you can take a controlled release formulation before going to bed. However, if you take it because you have trouble falling asleep, it is recommended to take it up to three hours before you go to bed; timing is individual and may require some experimentation.


If you wake up in the middle of the night, don't take melatonin to go back to sleep. Doing so will throw off your internal body clock. Melatonin should only be taken before your normal sleep time.
A sublingual form, which will go directly into your bloodstream, has a quicker onset. If you are taking a sublingual, quick release, or liquid form, you may take it closer to bedtime, about 30 minutes before you plan to go to sleep.
It is generally safe to take melatonin for up to three months, or possibly longer if recommended by your healthcare provider., Once you know when to take your melatonin, you need to know how much to take. Generally available in 0.3 to 5 mg doses, a small dose to aid in falling asleep may work better than a larger one; it will reduce or eliminate any undesirable side effects; and liquid or sublingual forms may be preferable. To ensure sleeping through the whole night, try taking a time-released dose of 0.3 to 5 mg.

, Once you have taken the melatonin, you should avoid certain behaviors so it can work the most efficient way possible. In order to make sure the melatonin is effective, you should avoid caffeine-rich foods and liquids at night.These substances include coffee, tea, soda, energy drinks, and chocolate.


You should also keep lighting very low once you have taken the melatonin. Any light reduces the production of melatonin, so it will inhibit your attempt to sleep.

"
"
Get over jet lag.,
Help with other disorders.,
Take the correct dose.",How to Take Melatonin3," When you travel, you can take melatonin to help with jet lag, which is daytime fatigue that occurs when changing time zones. The first night you arrive at your destination, you can take 0.5 to 5 mg of melatonin. Taking it can help you sleep and reset your sleeping patterns to match the new time zone you traveled to. Continue taking for two to five nights.


Lower doses, such as 0.5 to 3 mg, are recommended to avoid the sedating side effects that can sometimes be caused at higher doses.

, Studies have suggested that melatonin may help symptoms in numerous other disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, depression, fibromyalgia, migraines and other headaches, tardive dyskinesia (TD), epilepsy, menopause, and cancer.

, If you are using melatonin for reasons other than insomnia or jet lag, talk to your doctor first. You doctor will be able to guide you in regards to its effectiveness for you condition, the best dose, and the correct time to take it.


Take the amount prescribed by your doctor. Different doses have been shown to be effective for different disorders. You should also take it for as long as your doctor recommends it.

Understand the importance of having chairs that are ergonomic.,
Check the height.,
Check the width and depth.,
Check the lumbar support.,
Check the back.,
If you find any of these features missing or just plain not working, then you should either return the chair in exchange for another kind of chair, or you can exchange the defective one for one that does serve its function well as an ergonomic piece of office furniture.",How to Select an Ergonomic Office Chair," Ergonomic chairs help to reduce back problems, pain in the shoulders and neck and give better support to someone who uses it throughout the whole day.;
, Ergonomic office chairs should have a height adjustable seat. Not everybody is one size so look for the chairs that have those levers under them that allow for the proper adjustments. Usually, about 16 to 21 inches (40.6 to 53.3 cm) is a good standard height and this means having your workers’ feet flat on the floor at all times while they are seated. Of course, their thighs have to be parallel to the floor and their arms up to the right height when compared with their desks.

, When you are looking for an ergonomic chair, you need to look for one that is about 17 to 20 inches (43.2 to 50.8 cm) in width. This is the standard width for an ergonomic office chair. Depth usually refers to the space from the front of the seat to the back, and not how deep a cushion goes when it is sat upon. Basically, when you sit down, you should have about 2 to 4 inches (5.1 to 10.2 cm) between the back of your knees and the front edge of the seat. This makes for very good ergonomic chairs.

, This refers to the support given to your lower back and this is very important. The lower back is where the most back trouble starts and you need to have seats that will address this issue and prevent any further damage. Make sure that your chairs do not force one to slouch while seated. This will strain the lower spine. This means you need to find a chair that has adjustable lumbar support for both height and depth.

, Of course, a good chair should have good overall back support and 12 to 19 inches (30.5 to 48.3 cm) in the width of the backrest should do the trick. If the backrest is not part of the chair completely, this means you should find one that is adjustable. Again, it is attention to the spine that is important here and the best ergonomic chair makes sure that this is well attended to.

, Of course, it is difficult to have to look for different types of chairs of different sizes just to suit the many people in your office. Also, there is no such thing as the best fit for everyone. After all, people each have their own preferences for comfort. This is the reason why you should try your chairs first before actually purchasing them. If you can have some of your employees shop with you, all the better because this is one way that you can make the right purchase on executive office chairs, and your own executive office chair is important to consider in the batch as well. Keep in mind that as long as the chair has good back and neck support for the average height of a person and as long as it is sturdy but can be swivelled around while allowing for a good length from a person’s knees to the ground, it could be a good ergonomic chair. And it could be the best chair for you to invest in for you and your workers.

See your doctor.,
Share how much pain you're in with your family and friends.,
Keep a journal, both for emotional release and for your medical records.,
Take a warm (not hot) bath and mix in a small amount of pure sodium or Epsom Salts to relieve stress and soothe your muscles.,
When you first injure yourself it's considered an acute injury.,
If your pain persists, escalates, is uncontrollable, or is not a normal pain, see a doctor immediately.,
Meditation often helps with pain.,
Do not self diagnose.",How to Rid Yourself of Illnessess and Pain," Before anything else, explore what is happening to you with a doctor. Your doctor will make a decision if you need medication, physical therapy, rest, and support. Your Dr. will also tell you if you need to see additional specialists, including a pain doctor. Do not be surprised if you need more than one appointment with your regular Dr. before being referred to a specialist, that is completely normal. Many Dr.'s are very conservative when it comes to pain relief, so make sure you are very upfront about how much pain you are in. Otherwise it's easy for the Dr. to not understand exactly how much you hurt.;
, If they know how you're feeling they won't judge you when you miss events or have to lie down during a visit. When you share how difficult things are it makes you feel better and allows the people who love and care for you to support you during this difficult time., Record how you feel during the day. If something triggers pain, write it down, if you find when you eat something specific the pain is worse, keep a record. Your Dr. will find it invaluable and it will help you over time to remember how you felt at certain times. Doing this helps your Dr. recognize symptoms and issues, allowing your Dr. to diagnose you more accurately. If you are having seizures or other life threatening events be sure to wear a med-alert bracelet so that health professionals and EMTs are aware in case of an emergency..

, Soak and enjoy relaxing for no more than 45 minutes and then, if you are able to tolerate the sensation and it does not cause further pain, gently massage a fragrance-free and dye-free moisturizer with lidocaine liberally all over your body slowly after drying off.


Apply other, light, natural hygiene items (like powder or lip balm or deodorant) after.

, When you have an acute injury ice is the best immediate treatment. The best way to ice an area is to use an ice pad that conforms to your body, in a pinch you can use a bag of frozen vegetables, such as peas, wrapped in a towel. Use it for no more than 15 minutes at a time. Repeat every hour. On the other end of the spectrum, heat is better for chronic muscle and joint stiffness and cramping. Heat loosens tight muscles and helps soothe joint pain. Both ice and heat help to relieve pain and are valuable tools to have in your arsenal.

, Sometimes a sudden increase in pain and discomfort is considered a flare and completely normal for your condition but in others it can be a sign that there is a serious issue becoming worse. Only your Dr. can decide which it is. Do not try to diagnose yourself.


If you feel you need to go to a Dr., by all means go. Do not force yourself to live life in pain, there is no reason for anyone to do that. And that goes for emotional pain as well. If you are having emotional pain get a referral to a psychiatrist, in many cases emotional pain can actually cause physical pain.

, Inhale for the count of 5, hold, exhale for the count of 5, hold, repeat. Focus on your breathing rather than the pain. Think about things that make you feel happy and content. This removes your focus on your pain and allows it to subside.

, When you do that it is easy to think the worst. While yes, it could be something catastrophic such as cancer, it most likely isn't. However, it should absolutely be brought to the attention of a Dr. You don't have the training to figure out what is causing your pain when you're hurting unbearably for a long time. See your Dr. and let him diagnose and help you, that is what he is there for.

Don't use Advair if you have a complicating medical condition.",How to Use Advair," Hold the Discus horizontal in one hand. With your other hand, put your thumb on the the small curved section. Slide it away from you. The inner part of the Diskus should turn and click into place. The mouthpiece is now exposed. Turn the mouthpiece towards you.


Over the thumb grip, you should see a small window with a numbered dial underneath. The number tells you how many doses are left. When you're almost out, ""0-5"" will appear in red.;
, Hold the inhaler flat and level with the mouthpiece facing you. Use your finger to slide the lever until you feel it click into place. The dose is now ready.


There are many small blister packs full of medicine inside the inhaler. Pushing the lever breaks one of the blister packs, releasing the medicine.

, Ideally, you want to empty your lungs completely. Face away from the inhaler as you exhale to avoid displacing the prepared dose., Bring the Advair inhaler to your mouth. Place your lips on the mouthpiece. Breathe in deeply. Take your entire breath through your mouth in order to inhale the complete dose. Don't breathe through your nose.


Keep the inhaler flat and level as you breathe. This ensures the medicine is dispensed properly.

, Hold your breath for at least 10 seconds (or as long as you can) after inhaling. The medicine needs a short amount of time to be fully absorbed.


After 10 seconds (or as long as you're able to hold your breath), breathe out slowly, smoothly and evenly. You can start breathing normally.

, Rinse your mouth out with clean water. Do this each time you take a dose of Advair. Finish by gargling before your spit the water out. Do not swallow the water you use to rinse.


This is mainly to prevent a fungal infection of the throat called Thrush.Advair can cause an imbalance of the organisms in your mouth which allows this fungus to take hold., Slide the Diskus closed again. The dose dial will automatically move forward one number. Put the inhaler someplace safe and clean for easy access in the future.


Store Advair in a cool, dry place where it isn't within the reach of children. An Advair inhaler can be used for one month after it is first removed from the foil., The specifics for when to take Advair vary from patient to patient. The only way to know for sure when to use your inhaler is to get a doctor's advice. Luckily, Advair is a prescription drug, so you'll need to meet with a doctor before you can use it.


The rest of the instructions in this section are borrowed from online Advair resources. They are intended as general guidelines. Again, only your doctor can tell you what's right for you.

, Advair is typically used once in the morning and once in the evening. Try to take your Advair doses at roughly the same time each day. You don't have to hit these times exactly every single day, but you should do your best to get close. Within an hour of your scheduled time is usually fine.


For long term prevention of asthma symptoms, schedule your two doses 12 hours apart. For instance, you might try taking your first dose at 8:00 in the morning when you wake up and the second at 8:00 in the evening.
Setting an alarm on your phone or watch can be a big help here.

, This is crucial. You don't want to take more than your recommended dosage in a single 12-hour period unless your doctor tells you to. You may not be able to taste or smell the medicine when you inhale it, but it's still there. You won't get ""duds,"" so don't take extra medicine.Do not double an Advair dose even if you feel your symptoms worsen. The medicine takes time to work. Your doctor will be able to recommend alternative treatments for sudden, severe symptoms.

, Just like you shouldn't take the medicine more often than it's prescribed, you also won't want to take it less often. Continue to take the Advair at the prearranged times until your doctor tells you to stop. If you stop too early, your symptoms can worsen.

, This is very important to understand. The medicine in your Diskus is not meant to stop sudden, acute asthma attacks. It does not act quickly enough to have a significant effect. Taking multiple doses can result in side effects — sometimes severe ones.


Instead, carry a doctor-prescribed ""rescue inhaler"" for this. There are many types of rescue inhalers available. Some use a type of drug called beta-agonists, but alternatives are available, so talk to your doctor if you don't already have one., Missing a dose of Advair isn't something you'll want to make a habit of, but accidents happen. If you forget to take a dose, you can take it late if only an hour or two have passed. If your next dose is coming up, simply wait and take it then. Take just one dose at this time — don't take two to make up for the one you missed., One of the active ingredients in Advair, Salmeterol, is a type of drug called a long-acting beta agonist, or LABA. These drugs are slower, more gradual versions of the drugs used in many rescue inhalers. Don't take Advair if you are already taking a LABA for your asthma. The combined dosage may be enough to result in serious negative side effects.Your doctor should tell you this when prescribing Advair.


A few common examples of LABA drugs (and brand names to go with each) include: Salmeterol (Serevent), Formoterol (Foradil, Perforomist), and Arformoterol (Brovana)., While Advair is safe for the majority of patients, some people should not take it. Certain conditions, diseases, and drugs can change the effects of Advair, making it unsafe. In some cases, the negative interactions can be quite dangerous. See below.Do not take Advair if you:



Are allergic to the active ingredients (salmeterol and fluticasone)
Have a severe allergy to milk proteins
Are already taking LABA's (see above)
Are having a sudden ""attack"" of symptoms (see above)




Talk to your doctor first if you:



Are pregnant or breastfeeding
Have known allergies to other medicines
Have heart disease or high blood pressure
Have a seizure disorder like epilepsy
Have a weakened immune system
Have diabetes, glaucoma, tuberculosis, osteoporosis, a thyroid disorder, or liver disease.

Avoid using topical antibiotics on surgical wounds.",How to Use Antibiotics Effectively," The doctor chooses an antibiotic and the dosage based upon your state of health, your weight, and what microorganism(s) are causing your infection. This minimizes the risk of side effects. Do not take medication that has not been specifically prescribed for you and your medical condition.Let your doctor determine the treatment plan. Infections can be caused by a variety of microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi such as yeast. An antibiotic prescribed for a bacterial infection will not treat other types of infection.Do not use an antibiotic prescribed for another person.;
, Any drug, prescription, nonprescription, or alcohol, can interact with the antibiotic. This also includes supplements, natural or herbal remedies, and even multivitamins. The effectiveness of the antibiotic or your other medications may be compromised if you do not tell your doctor what else you’re taking.You should also tell your doctor whether you have ever experienced any allergies to medication or other problems with medication, including antibiotics.
Some antibiotics can cause your other medications to be metabolized slower or faster than usual. The antibiotic may cause a medicine to be absorbed into your system poorly. One of your medications could affect how the antibiotic is absorbed. Your current medications will influence what antibiotic the doctor chooses.Certain antibiotics affect the way alcohol is broken down or metabolized in the body. This can lead to uncomfortable symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and headache. You should not consume alcohol while using antibiotics., It contains important drug information including how the drug works, what the possible side effects are, and how it may interact with other drugs. Your pharmacist will give it to you when she fills your prescription.


Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about what you have read. They are happy to answer any questions you have. It’s always better to ask if you are unsure!

, Familiarize yourself with the prescribed dose (how much of the antibiotic you take each time) and frequency (how many times a day that dose is to be taken).


Antibiotics come in a variety of forms: capsule, tablet, chewable tablet, or liquid. The latter are more commonly prescribed in pediatrics for infants and children.
Your dose could be one or two tablets/capsules each time, or the dosing could be irregular. For example, Zithromax is an antibiotic which requires you to take a double dose on the first day and a single dose on the remaining days.Think about frequency in terms of a 24-hour period. Every 12 hours is the same as twice a day and 4 times a day is every six hours.

, Set an alarm or write it down in a journal or on the calendar. Schedule your doses so that they are associated with a normal daily activities like brushing your teeth or your regular bedtime., The patient leaflet will tell you if your antibiotic should be taken with food or if you must take it on an empty stomach.Food interferes with the absorption of some antibiotics. On the other hand, food may help prevent the stomach upset caused by other antibiotics. The information leaflet will specify how to take your medication., Do not fail to take the antibiotic because you cannot swallow a large tablet or the liquid’s taste is too unpleasant. The antibiotic is an essential part of your treatment.


The doctor has the option of prescribing the antibiotic in a different form or trying a totally different antibiotic.

, Take the drug as soon as you remember if you forget to take it. If it is close to your next dose, just wait. Continue with your normal dosing schedule as usual.Call your doctor if you end up missing several doses or more than one day’s worth. She can advise you how to proceed.Skipping doses prevents you from maintaining therapeutic levels of the antibiotic in your system. The microorganisms are not being inhibited or destroyed properly., You increase your chances of experiencing side effects when you have too much of the antibiotic in your body at once.Call your doctor if you accidentally take too many doses, as you may need to take medical action.


Do not compensate for a skipped dose by taking more than the prescribed amount of antibiotic.
In most cases, antibiotic overdose does not cause severe symptoms, although it may cause stomach upset and diarrhea., Even if you are starting to feel better, an incomplete drug course can lead to antibiotic resistance and/or a recurrence of your symptoms.You may end up needing a second course of antibiotics.


A complete course of antibiotics allows you enough time to eradicate the bacteria from your system.When you prematurely stop taking the antibiotic, the bacteria may not all be cleared completely from your system. The bacteria that survive are the strongest, and they are thus harder for the antibiotic to kill. These bacteria may also change or mutate, making the antibiotic less effective against this new strain. Antibiotic resistance is a serious problem, but using antibiotics wisely as prescribed can help prevent it., Common side effects of antibiotics are stomach upset, vomiting, diarrhea, and vaginal infections.Read the patient leaflet to know the specific side effects associated with your antibiotic. Talk to the doctor about the severity of your symptoms. She may decide to change the antibiotic.


Stomach upset, diarrhea, vaginal infections, and thrush (white patches of yeast in the mouth) occur because the antibiotic kills the good or normal bacteria along with the bad.These issues may need to be treated with other types of antibiotics or other medications. Your doctor may also suggest that you use a probiotic, such as those found in yogurt or dietary supplements, to help restore the “good” bacteria.
Antibiotics can affect the kidneys, ears, liver, or the peripheral nerves (nerves not in the brain or spine). Tell your doctor if you have abdominal pain, ringing in your ears, or tingling., And, if the antibiotic you are taking may make you more sensitive to the sun, make sure to limit sun exposure or wear sunscreen with SPF at least 30 when you are outside to reduce your chance of sunburn. Some antibiotics, particularly the tetracycline family, may cause phototoxicity, where your skin develops an intolerance to sun exposure. Talk to your doctor if you see any of the following symptoms while using an antibiotic:Exaggerated sunburn
Stinging or itching sensation on the skin
Blistering after sun exposure
Change in skin color
Skin peeling

, Be aware of signs like itching, rash, hives, or shortness of breath.Call 911 if you suspect an anaphylactic reaction, the most severe form of allergy, as it can be life-threatening. Symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction include:


Dizziness
Loss of consciousness
Labored breathing
Swelling of the tongue and airway
Blueness of the skin.
This reaction can progress to anaphylactic shock and death when there is a drop in blood pressure and heart failure., Sometimes, the prescribed antibiotic is not the correct one for combating the type(s) of infective microorganisms found in your system.


If the symptoms that the antibiotic is meant to treat do not improve, talk to your doctor.
Signs of an inadequately treated infection include fever, chills, or malaise (a general sense of weakness). A wound can be tender, swollen, hot and red, or draining pus., If you have a minor cut, scrape, or superficial burn, always clean it before applying any topical medication. Apply antibiotic cream to clean, dry skin.For cuts and scrapes, wash your hands thoroughly. Rinse the wound with clear running water. You can wash the area around the wound with soap and water, but avoid getting soap in the wound as it will irritate your skin. Use fine-tipped tweezers to remove any debris.For superficial burns, run cool water over the burned area for 10-15 minutes. Pat the area dry with a clean towel, but don’t rub or scrub, as you could break the skin or cause irritation., Antibiotic creams have not been shown to help minor wounds heal faster (despite any claims to the contrary). However, they can help keep infection at bay by creating a barrier between your wound and the environment, making it harder for germs to get into the cut or scrape.Apply only a thin layer. The cream or ointment will also help keep the bandage from sticking to your cut or scrape.Common OTC antibiotic creams include polymyxin B sulfate (Polysporin), bacitracin, and triple antibiotic ointment (Neosporin).
If you develop a rash while using an OTC antibiotic cream, stop using it.
Do not apply an OTC antibiotic cream to very deep or large cuts, puncture wounds, animal bites, or serious burns. Seek medical assistance., Superficial, first-degree burns can be treated with antibiotic ointment. The ointment can help keep the burn moisturized and create a barrier to help prevent infection.Silver sulfadiazine is a commonly prescribed antibiotic cream for burns.However, your doctor may prescribe you another cream, especially if you are pregnant or breastfeeding., Don’t apply more antibiotic cream than you’re instructed to, either by your physician or by the cream’s packaging. Avoid applying it more than three times a day., Unless you have been otherwise instructed by your physician, do not use topical antibiotics on wounds from surgeries. They can actually hinder the healing process in some cases. They may also cause contact dermatitis, a condition that makes your skin red, sore, and irritated.If your doctor instructs you to apply a topical antibiotic to a surgical wound, always follow her instructions.

Get a note from your doctor if you need syringes.",How to Travel With Prescription Medications," When traveling abroad, taking prescription medication can get tricky. Certain prescription medications may be illegal in some countries. In Japan, for example, you cannot bring Adderall into the country. Other medications may only be allowed in certain amounts, or require medical documentation. Check regulations so you do not end up without your medication after going through customs.You can check regulations on your medications by checking country specific information on the State Department's website. You can also call the embassy or consulate of the country you plan to visit.
It may be helpful to also browse the Center for Disease Control and Prevention website. The United Nations website also has information on prescription drug regulations by country. With a little detective work, you should be able to see what restrictions, if any, are placed on your medication.;
, It's a good idea to plan ahead when traveling if you're on any prescription medication. You should make an effort to fill the prescription well in advance so you have enough for your trip. If you wait until the day before you leave, any delays or issues at the pharmacy could result in you not getting your medication in time for your travels.

, In some countries, documentation is required when traveling with prescription medication. You may have to have a copy of your prescription with you to present at customs. You may also need to have a letter from your doctor stating the purpose of your drug. Make sure you have these documents together well before you travel.Doctors, especially in the US, tend to be very busy. It may take your doctor a few days, or even a few weeks, to write a letter about your medication. Start gathering these documents well in advance if you're planning on traveling abroad.

, Some medications need to be taken at roughly the same time each day. If this is the case with your medication, talk to your doctor about how to adjust to time zones. He or she can give you advice on how to gradually adjust the time you take your medication in a new time zone., You should pack all your medication in your carry-on bag. In the event your checked bag gets lost along the way, you do not want to be without necessary medication.You should also make sure to keep your medication in all its original containers. If you're flagged for a security check, you do not want to look like you're carrying any suspicious pills.

, When traveling with medication, you should pack slightly more than you need. Travel delays happen. If you end up stuck for a few extra days due to weather or other delays, you do not want to risk missing your medication. Always make sure the supply of your medication is at least a few days greater than the length of your trip.

, Some medications need to be stored at cooler temperatures. If your medication is normally stored in the fridge, you should make sure to store it properly during travel. You can use an ice pack, a cool bag, a thermos flask, or an insulated pouch to keep your medication cool.While it's unlikely any of the above items would be banned, it may be a good idea to double check airline regulations. In the event there are restrictions, you can usually get restrictions waived due to medical reasons.
Even medications that do not need to be stored in cool temperatures may be affected by heat. It's unlikely the heat of an airplane would get hot enough to affect medication. However, it's a good idea to check with your doctor before traveling if there are any warnings about heat on your medication's label. It's better safe than sorry., You should have a copy of your prescription with you when you travel, which should usually contain some information about the medication and its purpose. This is not only important for security purposes. In the event you need medical care when on vacation, it can be useful for doctors to have copies of your prescription.If you don't have a copy of your prescription, you should be able to get one from your doctor's office. This may take a few days, so plan ahead.

, Liquid medications are usually exempt from liquid restrictions on most airlines. However, you usually need to keep the medication in its original container. Some airlines may require a doctor's note or a written prescription. Check the regulations on the airline you're flying through if you're carrying liquid medications., Medication does occasionally get lost. In a bind, you should be able to fill a prescription out of state. However, this may cost a lot if your insurance does not provide out of state coverage. Make sure you know your insurance policy's regulations regarding travel prior to a trip., If you need syringes, you will usually need a note from your doctor explaining their purpose. You will also probably need to keep syringes in their original container for travel. As always, plan ahead. It may take a few days for your doctor to write a letter, so make the request in advance if you're traveling."

Continue coping with stress healthfully.",How to Use Antidepressants During Pregnancy," Generally, antidepressants are not recommended for use during pregnancy. Exceptions can be made when the risks posed by depression outweigh the risks of medication treatment during pregnancy.Some people may stay on antidepressants if there is a history of severe and/or recurrent depression, a history of mental illness (such as bipolar disorder), or a history of suicidal thoughts.Talk to your provider and discuss whether medications is safe for you during pregnancy. Do you feel like you can safely come off from your medications now and function well? If not, then you should discuss what risks your particular medication may pose to your pregnancy.
Be aware that there are risks to the baby if depression goes untreated, which include an increased risk of irritability, less activity and alertness, and fewer facial expressions when compared to babies born to moms without depression. Some evidence also links depression to changes in how the baby grows and to shorter pregnancy lengths.;
, If you are prescribed medication during pregnancy it’s likely within a certain class of antidepressant medications, known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. These include the medications citalopram (Celexa), fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft). Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as duloxetine (Cymbalta) and venlafaxine (Effexor XR) may also be prescribed.Other medications that may be prescribed include Bupropion (Wellbutrin) and tricyclic antidepressants. It should be noted that these are not considered first line treatment and may only be prescribed with caution for women who have not responded favorably to SSRIs or SNRIs. Bupropion may be linked with an increased risk of the fetus being born with heart defects., Some antidepressant medications should be avoided during pregnancy. These include the SSRI paroxetine (Paxil) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), including phenelzine (Nardil) and tranylcypromine (Parnate). These medications are associated with risks including fetal heart defects and limited fetal growth., Talk to your provider about medication use. Most medications are taken in pill form once or twice daily. It’s advised to take medications at the same time each day. You may be directed to take medication with food.


Do not miss a dose. If you do miss a dose, take it as soon as possible. If your dose is closer to your next dose than your previous dose, then skip the dose and take your next scheduled dose.Your provider may have specific recommendations for you in taking medications. Use as directed.

, The best way to know if you can safely take antidepressant medication is to consult with your prescriber. Tell your provider that you are planning to become pregnant or are pregnant and discuss your medication options. You may stay on your current medication or begin taking a different medication. You may start to slowly wean off of your medication. Consult with your pharmacist or provider.Read any information that comes with your medication to understand the risks.
If you make changes in medication, always do so under the supervision of a trained professional.

, You may choose to switch medications prior to becoming pregnant. Risks of switching medications include failed treatment or relapse of depression. Prior to making a medication switch, speak with your provider to weigh the potential costs and benefits.There may be a medication more suitable for pregnancy than one you currently take. When weighing risks, discuss your options thoroughly with your provider. Ask, “What potential risks are associated with switching medication? How will this affect my depression? What known risks could affect the developing fetus?”

, When taking medication, it’s important to schedule follow-up appointments to monitor use and effectiveness. An individualized plan is always best.This is especially true while pregnant. Note any changes you experience related to medication use during pregnancy. Discuss any side-effects or changes in effectiveness with your provider.


Note any concerns you have about medication while pregnant.

, While it is true that there are risks, it is also risky to avoid antidepressants if you've been prescribed them, and both you and your developing fetus will benefit from keeping you as mentally healthy as possible during your pregnancy.


Overall risks remain low, yet a complete understanding of fetal risks remains unknown. Some possible links include certain malformations and risks to the developing fetus, such as miscarriage, heart problems such as congenital heart disease, and lung problems such as pulmonary hypertension., Some newborns may experience discontinuation symptoms once born. This means that the baby may experience a type of withdrawal from antidepressant medication, including jitters, irritability, or poor feeding.It should be noted that tapering doses (or decreasing medication) in the last trimester is not associated with a decrease in symptoms, and is not recommended for women who may be at risk for postpartum depression.

, You may risk a relapse in depression if you stop using antidepressants while pregnant. Other symptoms associated with stopping the use of SSRIs include nausea and vomiting, chills, fatigue, anxiety, and irritability.You may wish to weigh your risk of postpartum depression once your pregnancy is over.


Do not discontinue use without the supervision of your provider. He or she may recommend tapering your medication, which means slowly coming off of medication over time with decreased doses. Suddenly stopping medication can lead to unwanted side-effects., Aside from using medication, make sure you practice healthy coping strategies to cope with everyday stress. Engage in meaningful friendships, do appropriate exercise, use relaxation methods (such as deep breathing and muscle relaxation), and avoid unnecessary stressors. Avoid people who stress you out and learn the value of saying “no” and setting limits.Do not turn to alcohol or drugs as a way to cope. There is no safe time during pregnancy to consume alcohol.Alcohol can lead to problems such as miscarriage, low birth, weight, premature birth, and fetal alcohol syndrome."

Discuss existing allergies and medical history with your doctor or pharmacist.,
Inform your doctor of any current prescriptions and medications.,
Take Alprazolam as directed by your doctor or pharmacist.,
Familiarize yourself with the possible side effects of Alprazolam.,
Learn how to handle overdoses and missed doses of Alprazolam.,
Store your Alprazolam as directed.",How to Use Alprazolam," Inform your doctor of any allergies, especially to benzodiazepines such as diazepam or lorazepam. Provide your doctor with your medical history, especially if you have liver disease, kidney disease, severe lung or breathing problems, or if you suffer from drug or alcohol abuse. Since Alprazolam may contain inactive ingredients that can cause allergic reactions or other medical problems, your doctor may want to review alternative medication for you.;
, Alprazolam may interact differently with specific medications, so you must inform your doctor of any medications you are taking so they can monitor your health or change your existing prescription if necessary. Inform your doctor of any over-the-counter medicines you usually take such as cold-medicine or any other medicines that may cause drowsiness. If you are a smoker, inform your doctor so they can adjust the dosage if necessary.

, Doses of Alprazolam will vary between individuals based on their specific medical conditions. Take the proper dosage amount of Alprazolam prescribed by your doctor on a regular basis until otherwise instructed. Because Alprazolam may be addicting or can be poisonous if you overdose, do not increase your dose unless directed to do so by your doctor. On the other hand, Alprazolam can also cause withdrawal symptoms such as seizures if you suddenly stop taking the medication. If you have not been instructed to do so by your doctor or pharmacist, do not increase or decrease your dose of Alprazolam without consulting them first to avoid any serious repercussions.

, Drowsiness and dizziness are the most common side effects of Alprazolam. Other possible side effects of taking Alprazolam include mood changes, slurred speech, clumsiness, trouble walking, decreased or increased interest in sex, yellowing eyes or skin, and signs of infection. You may also have allergic reactions to Alprazolam, such as developing rashes, itching and swelling, severe dizziness, and trouble breathing. Consult your doctor immediately if you suffer from these side effects repeatedly or from any other side effects not mentioned.


Take extra precaution when experiencing side effects of Alprazolam. Do not drive, use machinery, or perform similar activities that require you to be alert until you are sure you can perform those types of activities safely. Do not drink alcoholic beverages or breast-feed because Alprazolam will pass into breast milk and have negative effects on infants. Do not take Alprazolam if you are pregnant because it may potentially harm unborn babies. If any of these precautions will affect your current lifestyle, consult with your doctor for more details or alternative medications.

, If you have overdosed on Alprazolam, you may experience severe drowsiness, slowed or reduced reflexes, slowed breathing, or loss of consciousness. If an overdose has been suspected, you must contact the poison control center in your country immediately. If you have missed your dose of Alprazolam, you must take it as soon as you remember or skip your missed dose if it is close to the time you normally take it. Do not double your dose to ""catch up.""

, Store Alprazolam at temperatures of between 59 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit (15 to 30 degrees Celsius) and away from any light and moisture. Do not store your Alprazolam in the bathroom where moisture or steam may accumulate, flush your medications down the toilet, or pour them into a drain unless you have been instructed to do so. Store your Alprazolam in a safe location away from where your children and pets can access it. If you need to dispose of Alprazolam, contact your doctor, pharmacist, or local waste disposal company to learn how to properly dispose of the medication.

Consult with your physician before taking any steroids.,
Take Winstrol with lots of water.,
Don't drink any alcohol while on steroids.,
Don't take Winstrol with anticoagulant medication.,
Consider using Winstrol if you have hereditary angioedema.,
Consider using Winstrol for aplastic anemia.,
Try Winstrol short-term for muscle wasting diseases.,
Don't take Winstrol illegally to enhance athletic performance.",How to Take Winstrol," Anabolic (meaning protein and muscle building) steroids are powerful medicines with various health benefits, but all are considered controlled substances that require a prescription due to their potential for abuse and serious side effects.Your family doctor is not likely to prescribe anabolic steroids for you unless you suffer from angioedema, aplastic anemia (both blood disorders) or some muscle wasting condition. Wanting bigger muscles or greater strength is not a valid reason for an ethical doctor to write you a prescription for anabolic steroids.


For hereditary angioedema, adult dosage recommendations usually start at 2 mg, three times day.If successful at reducing swelling, dosages are reduced after one to three months to 2 mg daily.
For aplastic anemia, adult and childhood dosages typically start at 1 mg/kg per day and can be slowly increased from there.
Winstrol comes in round pink tablets (meant to be taken orally) and in a serum meant to be injected directly into muscle tissue. Usage ranges from a few weeks to about six months at a time.;
, If you are taking Winstrol orally (via tablets), remember to always drink a full glass of water with it.Drinking water helps the tablet dissolve quicker and also prevents stomach irritation. The pills contain a compound called c17 methyl, which helps the stanozolol from being destroyed in the stomach and liver so it can work on muscle growth; however, the downside to c17 methyl is that it irritates the stomach and is toxic to the liver. Drinking lots of water with the pills will help lessen the impact of c17 methyl on your body.


Start with at least an 8-ounce glass of water with each pill you take. Avoid acidic juices as they may contribute to stomach irritation.
Taken orally, stanozolol doesn't lose its potency (compared to injecting it) as much as some other anabolic steroids do.

, All types of steroids, particularly anabolic steroids, are damaging to the liver because they are toxic (difficult or impossible to break down into harmless by-products) and stanozolol is no exception.As such, you shouldn't consume any alcoholic beverages (beer, wine, liquor) even in moderation while on anabolic steroids because alcohol (ethanol) is also toxic to the liver — combining the two is like a ""double-whammy"".


Any potential benefits of moderate alcohol consumption (blood thinning, antioxidants) does not outweigh the potential negative side effects when combined with steroid medication.
Don't let the lack of alcohol consumption impact your social outings. Switch to ""virgin"" cocktails, soda, seltzer water, and/or grape juice if your friends are drinking.

, Anticoagulant medications (also called blood thinners) such as heparin or warfarin reduce the body's ability to make a clot, which can be helpful for some cardiovascular diseases.Anabolic steroids, however, tend to increase your sensitivity to anticoagulants, which increases your risk of internal bleeding and bruising.As such, either don't combine the two different types of medication, or have your doctor decrease your anticoagulant medication to more appropriate levels.


Antiplatelet drugs (such as aspirin) should also be avoided while you're on anabolic steroids.
Blood thinners reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke, so they often take precedent over anabolic steroids if your doctor thinks the two can't be combined for safety reasons.

, The primary indicated use of Winstrol (stanozolol) for people, according to the FDA, is to help prevent and/or decrease the frequency and severity of attacks of hereditary angioedema.Angioedema causes swelling of the face, extremities, genitals, large intestine and throat. Stanozolol may decrease the frequency and severity of attacks because it stimulates protein synthesis.


Hereditary angioedema is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency in C1 esterase (enzyme) inhibitor, which leads to widespread inflammation and swelling in blood vessels.
A blood test taken during a flare-up can determine if you have this condition.Angioedema-related swelling is similar to hives, but the inflammation is under the skin instead of on the surface.

, Aplastic anemia is a rare and serious disease (usually beginning in childhood) that involves dramatically reduced production of red blood cells.The disease causes severe fatigue and increases the risk of infections and uncontrolled bleeding. Long-term treatments for aplastic anemia include blood transfusions or stem cell transplants, although short-term use of steroids such as stanozolol can stimulate red blood production according to a 2004 study.The 2004 study showed that stanozolol induced a remission of aplastic anemia in 38% of children given the drug for an average for 25 weeks at a dosage of 1 mg/kg per day.
Stanozolol is considered ineffective for severe forms of aplastic anemia.
However, stanozolol is not the best steroid for aplastic anemia. In earlier studies, it was found that fluoxymesterone and others are more effective than stanozolol for treating aplastic anemia in adults., Stanozolol is commonly used in veterinary medicine to help debilitated animals gain muscle mass, strength, weight and energy. The steroid also has the same effect in people, although it's not approved by the FDA directly for such use. Your doctor may decide to recommend Winstrol (stanozolol) ""off-label,"" which means for uses other than initially intended. Diseases that lead to muscle wasting include polymyositis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease), Guillain-Barre syndrome, neuropathy, polio (poliomyelitis), anorexia nervosa, advanced forms of cancer and debilitating infections such as HIV.The benefit of using Winstrol (stanozolol) compared to other steroids for increasing muscle size and gaining weight is that it's strongly anabolic (builds protein and muscle quickly), but it doesn't lead to as many negative side effects.
Stanozolol also doesn't convert to estrogen (the main female hormone) in the bloodstream, unlike many other steroids, which is beneficial to men who want to avoid gynecomastia (breast tissue growth) and other estrogen-related side effects.
Using prescription medications ""off-label"" is legal and ethical if a doctor determines the benefits to a patient outweigh the risks.

, Stanozolol is an anabolic steroid (and a synthetic derivative of testosterone), which means it promotes muscle building.As such, Winstrol has a long history of abuse by athletes who want to quickly and greatly increase their muscle mass and strength in order to perform at higher levels within their sports. Without a prescription, this strategy is illegal and also dangerous because of all the serious symptoms and side effects that are related to anabolic steroid abuse.


Besides making muscles bigger and stronger, anabolic steroids such as stanozolol help athletes recover from workouts quicker by reducing the muscle damage that occurs while straining muscle fibers.This enables athletes to work out harder and for longer periods of time.
Anabolic steroids also create an aggressive mood in users, which can be helpful in competitive sports, but not always so beneficial in other daily situations that require patience.
Side effects of stanozolol usage includes: liver toxicity, liver failure, male pattern baldness, increased facial/body hair growth, testicle shrinkage, over-aggressiveness, and acne.

Consult with your doctor.,
Discuss the potential of taking methadone at home.,
Never alter your dosage.,
Learn how to take methadone at home.,
Avoid methadone if you have risk factors.,
Learn what methadone is commonly prescribed for.,
Understand how methadone works.,
Be aware of unwanted side effects.,
Consider the alternatives.",How to Take Methadone," If you are interested in taking methadone for opioid addiction, make an appointment with your doctor for an interview and physical exam. By law, methadone is only dispensed through an opioid treatment program (OTP) certified by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and supervised by a licensed physician.As such, if you are accepted into the program, you need to see your doctor every 24 – 36 hours to get your appropriate dose.


The length of time for methadone treatment varies, but it should be a minimum of 12 months.Some patients require years of treatment.
Methadone is given primarily by mouth through either tablets, powder or liquid.
Single doses of methadone should not exceed 80 – 100 mg daily — its effectiveness can last between 12 – 36 hours depending on your age, weight, level of addiction and tolerance to the drug.;
, After a period of stable progress and consistent compliance with the methadone dosage schedule, you may be given the drug in larger quantities to take home and administer it there to yourself.You'll still need to see your doctor for progress visits and social support meetings, but you'll have more freedom away from the clinic. The decision is the doctor's and basically boils down to trust and a proven track record of compliance and desire to kick your addiction.


Addiction clinics often disperse liquid methadone to patients, although tablets and powders that dissolve in water are typically given to patients for home use.
Never share your specific allotment of methadone with anyone. It's illegal to give it out or sell it.
Keep your methadone in a safe and secure place within your home, particularly out of reach of children.
Methadone is not injected at clinics or for supervised home use, although sometimes illicit methadone is injected into the vein by street users.

, Methadone dosage is generally based on your body weight and opiate tolerance, but the specific dosage is calculated and altered over time based on your progress — which is measured by reduced opiate cravings.Once the dosage is established and then progressively lowered, it's crucial to follow the doctor's instruction exactly. Never take more methadone than recommended in hopes of it working better or quicker. If a methadone dose is missed or forgotten, or it doesn't feel like it's working, don't take an extra dose — resume your schedule and dose the following day.


The tablets, sometimes called ""diskettes,"" contain about 40 mg of methadone — which is a common dosage for people to take while administering at home.
If you can't remember your doctor's instructions, then follow the directions on the prescription label carefully or ask the pharmacist to explain anything you don't understand.

, If you are given liquid methadone for home use, then carefully measure the medicine with a dosing syringe or with a special dose-measuring spoon or cup — you can get these from any pharmacist.Don't mix the liquid with any additional water. If you have tablets or diskettes, drop them into at least four ounces (120 mL) of water or orange juice — the powder will not dissolve entirely. Drink the solution right away and then add a little more liquid to get the entire dose. Never chew the dry tablets or diskettes.


You may be instructed to take only half of a tablet, so break it along the lines that are scored into it.
Take your methadone at the same time every day, or according to your doctor's instructions.
Set your watch, phone or alarm clock to remind yourself of the dosing time.

, You shouldn't use methadone if you are allergic to it or if you have asthma, severe breathing problems, heart rhythm disorder, heart disease or bowel obstruction (paralytic ileus).Any of these conditions are likely to increase the risk of experiencing negative reactions to methadone.


Patients should share their complete medical/drug history with healthcare providers to ensure the safe use of methadone.
Your doctor will normally decrease your dosage or tell you to take less methadone as your treatment progresses, but they might increase the dose if you experience any unforeseen withdrawal pain.

, Methadone was first made in the 1930's in response to doctors wanting a pain-killing drug (analgesic) much less addictive than morphine.By the early 1970s, methadone was used less as a painkiller and more for helping people reduce or quit their addiction to opiates, including morphine and heroin. Methadone is now the top choice for opiate addiction and widely used in comprehensive medication-assisted treatment (MAT) programs that also include counseling and social support.If you're dealing with significant chronic pain and want a painkiller to take long-term, methadone is likely not the answer due to its numerous side effects.
When taken as prescribed and over the short term, methadone is relatively safe and effective for helping people recover from their narcotic addictions.

, Methadone works as an analgesic by changing how your brain and nervous system respond to pain signals/sensations.So while it can lessen the painful symptoms of heroin withdrawal, it also blocks the euphoric effects of opiates — essentially stopping the pain without triggering the sensation of being ""high."" As such, an addict uses methadone while taking less opiates until there is no withdrawal pain. Then, the addict is weaned off of methadone.


Methadone is available as pills, liquids and wafer forms. It's meant to be taken once daily and the pain relief lasts between four to eight hours depending on dosage.
Opiate drugs include heroin, morphine and codeine, whereas as semi-synthetic opioids include oxycodone and hydrocodone.

, Although methadone is considered a relatively safe medication, side effects are not uncommon. The most common side effects triggered by methadone use include dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting and/or increased sweating.The more serious, albeit less common, side effects include labored or shallow breathing, chest pain, racing heartbeat, hives, severe constipation and/or hallucinations/confusion.Although methadone is intended to prevent opiate addiction, dependence and painful withdrawal symptoms, there's still potential for getting addicted to methadone.Perhaps ironically, methadone is abused as an illicit street drug, although it's ability to get people ""high"" (euphoric) is not nearly as strong as opiates.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding can take methadone for addiction (it won't cause birth defects) and it lowers the risk of miscarriage.

, Aside from methadone, there are a few other options for the treatment of opioid dependence: buprenorphine and L-alpha-acetyl-methadol (LAAM).Buprenorphine (Buprenex) is a very strong semi-synthetic narcotic recently approved to help treat heroin addiction. Compared to methadone, it causes far less respiratory problems and is thought to be more difficult to overdose. LAAM is a good alternative to methadone because it has longer lasting effects — instead of daily treatments, addicts only take the drug three times weekly. LAAM is similar to methadone in that it doesn't get the user ""high"", but it's considered a little safer in terms of side effects.


Buprenorphine doesn't lead to significant physical dependence or discomforting withdrawal symptoms, so getting off it is typically much easier compared to methadone.
LAAM can trigger anxiety in users and it can lead to liver dysfunction, hypertension, skin rashes and nausea.

You can take it right after having unprotected sex, if you need to do so. You don't need to wait until the next morning.The pill will be most effective within 24 hours but still relatively effective for up to 3 days. However, you can still take for up to 5 days after having sex, but it is not as effective.;
, This medication should not be taken on an empty stomach. Take it with food and water for it to be most effective.

, If you vomit within 2 hours of taking the pill, the dose may not be effective. Therefore, you can take another dose of the pill to ensure effectiveness.It's a good idea to talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking a second dose., While it has not been studied much, it is theorized that certain drugs will make Plan B Step-One less effective. Certain anti-seizure drugs are in this category, including Dilantin, Felbatol, Mesantoin, Peganone, Phenobarbital, and Tegretol. Another drug that can mess with its effectiveness is Rifampin, a drug for tuberculosis.


Talk to your doctor if you are on one of these drugs and need to use emergency contraceptive.
Though antibiotics can affect your regular birth control, it has not been shown to affect Plan B One-Step.

, The Plan B One-Step pill can cause side effects for a couple of days. You may notice some stomach issues, such as abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. Your breasts may also be sore. Additionally, you may get headaches or dizziness, or you may feel extra tired. These symptoms are relatively normal and will subside. If they don't, talk to your doctor., Plan B can make your period late. Usually, it will only be a week or so. Nonetheless, Plan B can cause other problems, such as spotting. If you spot for a week after taking the pill, talk to your doctor.Similarly, if you have abnormal cramps or pain a month or so after taking the pill, you should also talk to your doctor.These symptoms are problematic because they could be a sign that you miscarried a pregnancy. On the other hand, they can indicate an ectopic pregnancy, where an egg implants but not in the uterus., The next time you see your doctor (any doctor), tell him or her that you took the pill. Your doctor needs to know just in case that explains any symptoms you may be having.Also, talk to your doctor if your period is more than three weeks late after taking the pill.Plan B One-Step is not 100% effective all of the time, so it is still possible to get pregnant after taking it.

, Do not use Plan B One-Step as a substitute for other forms of birth control. If you are sexually active, then you should consider using birth control and condoms. Using birth control alone will not offer any protection against STDs, which can have lifelong consequences such as infertility and even death. However, wearing a condom every time you have sex can help to reduce your risk of getting an STD.Talk to your doctor or visit a free clinic to discuss your safe sex and birth control options.

, The primary situation in which you would take the pill is when you have had vaginal sex without other protection against getting pregnant. ""Unprotected"" sex can mean a variety of things, including when other types of birth control fail or you miss doses of other types of contraceptive pills.

, If you notice your condom has broken while having sex, that's a good reason to take an emergency contraceptive. Also, if you notice spillage near the vaginal area, that's another good reason to take Plan B One-Step.

, Another reason to take Plan B is because you missed birth control pills within certain time frames. For instance, if you are taking progesterone-only pills, you must be on time with those pills. If you are more than three hours off, you may not be protected and will need to take a Plan B pill.

, Also, if you miss a single dose in the first week of your 21 or 28 pill pack or three or more doses in week two or three, you may not be protected. With the patch, you are unprotected if you've had it off more than a day in the first three weeks, and with Nuvaring, you're unprotected if you've had it out for more than three hours in the first three weeks. Also, antibiotics can affect the effectiveness of your pills.

, Many others have been in your situation, and it is not the end of the world.You can find Plan B One-Step, and more than likely, it will take care of the problem for you.

, For Plan B One-Step to be the most effective, you need to find and take it within 72 hours of having sex. In fact, the sooner you take it, the better, which is why it is sometimes referred to as ""the morning-after pill."" Taking it within 24 hours is best.You can buy it to keep on hand. The pill can be fairly expensive ($50 or more), and it will have an expiration date.However, you can get generic pills that work the same for slightly cheaper. For instance, you can buy a generic version, After Pill, online for about $20.If you are a college student, sometimes your student health center will have Plan B One-Step for cheaper., The easiest way to get Plan B is to go to a pharmacy. You don't need to visit your doctor first, as you don't need a prescription to buy Plan B. It is available over the counter.In the past, you need a prescription if you were 16 and under to buy the Plan B One-Step Pill. However, now anyone can buy the pill who needs it, and you don't even need to show ID.You may need to ask a pharmacist to obtain the pill.
If you're embarrassed, try going to a pharmacy that's not near you. Visit one on the other side of town, or try going at a time when there won't be as many people around. Additionally, try talking to a pharmacist or cashier who's the same sex as you, if that will help you feel less embarrassed.

, If you don't have quick access to a pharmacy, you can also visit a health clinic. Places like Planned Parenthood carry this contraceptive as well."

Take oral medications.,
Try budesonide.,
Use alternate delivery methods of corticosteroids.",How to Treat Crohn's with Corticosteroids1," The most common form of corticosteroids that doctors prescribe are oral tablets. These are given for moderate to severe flare ups. They can also be used alongside immunosuppressants to help reduce inflammation.Examples of oral corticosteroids are prednisone, methylprednisolone , and hydrocortisone.;
, Budesonide cannot be used for Crohn's flare ups in all areas. This medication only works to treat Crohn’s disease in the ileum (the end of the small intestine) or the first part of the large intestine. Budesonide is also used for mild to moderate flare ups instead of severe ones.Budesonide is a corticosteroid that has been developed more recently and may work better than the older oral ones.
This corticosteroid works faster against the symptoms than other steroids. This corticosteroid also produces less negative side effects., If you are unable to take oral steroids, there are other ways you can get a dosage of corticosteroids. These steroids can also be administered rectally or intravenously.Rectal corticosteroids can be used for mild or moderate Crohn’s disease that affects the rectum or lower part of the colon. They can be administered as enemas, foams, or suppositories.
Intravenous corticosteroids are used for severe Crohn’s disease.

Talk to your doctor about taking flaxseed oil.,
Follow the manufacturer’s instructions.,
Combine flaxseed oil with juice, water, or tea.,
Consider taking flaxseed oil in capsule form.,
Store flaxseed oil or capsules in the refrigerator.,
Add flaxseed to food after it is already cooked.,
Cut back if you start to experience gastrointestinal side effects.",How to Take Flax Oil1," It is important to ask your doctor about adding flaxseed oil to your diet, especially if you are taking certain medications. Flaxseed oil may interact with some medications including blood thinners, cholesterol-lowering statins, and diabetes medications.Always tell your physician about all medications and supplements that you are taking.;
, The flaxseed oil product that you buy should include instructions about how much and how often to take flaxseed oil. Read and follow the package for specific instructions on how to take the flaxseed oil.1 tablespoon of flaxseed oil taken up to three times per day is a common dosage, but make sure that you check the package of your flaxseed oil to be sure.
Flaxseed oil taken in excess can cause oily skin, breakouts, and even oily stools.

, If you are not a great fan of the taste, mix with water, green tea or fruit juice — since it is an oil, it won’t mix very well, but if taste is a problem, mixing it will help. It can also help to take liquid flaxseed oil along with a meal or at least a snack to get rid of any aftertaste from taking the oil.

, Flaxseed oil is also available in a capsule form. Again, follow the manufacturer’s instructions for how to take the flaxseed oil. Take the flaxseed oil capsules with a full glass of water., Keep your flaxseed oil capsules or flaxseed oil in the refrigerator in a sealed glass container. Oils can react in air and become rancid, but storing your flaxseed in the refrigerator will help to prolong its life.

, Flaxseed oil should not be heated. Heating the oil destroys much of its nutritional benefits.If you are adding flaxseed oil to your meals, make sure that you add it after cooking your food. Drizzle flaxseed oil on top of food rather than using it to cook your food.

, Flaxseed oil may cause some gas, diarrhea, and/or bloating when you first start taking it. For most people, the gas and/or bloating stops after one to two weeks of use. If you notice any side effects from taking flaxseed oil, cut down on your doses for a while."

Use corticosteroids for acute flare ups of Crohn’s.,
Take corticosteroids as a short-term treatment.,
Recognize that you cannot stop corticosteroids suddenly.",How to Treat Crohn's with Corticosteroids2," Corticosteroids have been used since the 1950s to treat irritable bowel disorders. They are fast-acting when used for acute flare ups of Crohn’s disease. Acute flare ups are intense, sudden flare ups that produce severe symptoms.Corticosteroids are used to treat inflammation in the body.Because of this, you use the corticosteroids as needed, not to manage chronic, recurring symptoms.
Corticosteroids are used for symptoms including fever, nausea, and weight loss.

, Corticosteroids are meant to be a short-term treatment for flare ups of symptoms associated with Crohn’s disease. They are helpful in reducing symptoms after a flare up has occurred, but do not prevent flare ups.Corticosteroids generally are used for three to four months.Corticosteroids are given in the lowest dosage possible for the patient. Your doctor will only prescribe them for the shortest amount of time they are needed to help your symptoms.
You are not supposed to use corticosteroids often, even for short periods of time.

, Corticosteroids cause the adrenal glands to stop producing cortisol. Cortisol is the hormone produced by the adrenal glands in the body that is similar to corticosteroids. Taking a high dose of steroids can increase the likelihood of shutting off the adrenal glands, so you cannot just stop taking corticosteroids. That is why tapering off of steroids is recommended.Your doctor will taper you off the corticosteroids so that your body has enough time to start producing cortisol.
Your doctor will reduce your dose of corticosteroids over a course of a week or two.

"
"
Be aware of the side effects.,
Reduce the negative side effects.,
Discuss alternate options with your doctor.",How to Treat Crohn's with Corticosteroids3," One reason corticosteroids are not suggested for frequent use is because they can have negative side effects. For many people, the side effects are worse than the flare up symptoms, so they decide not to use corticosteroids. Side effects are connected to the dose and how long the treatment lasts. Some side effects include:High blood pressure
Puffy face
Night sweats
Higher risk of infection
Weight gain
Mood swings
Increased facial hair or acne
Cataracts
Psychosis
Elevated blood sugar levels
Osteoporosis
Insomnia

, Many doctors will prescribe alternate medication instead of corticosteroids. Even if you do take corticosteroids, there are ways you can limit the negative side effects.Your doctor may taper you off the steroids as soon as you need to so that you don’t get more steroids than needed.
Your doctor may suggest alternate-day dosing, where you take corticosteroids on every other day.
Corticosteroids taken rectally may produce less side effects or be safer.
Calcium supplements may help protect against osteoporosis.

, Corticosteroids are an older treatment option for acute Crohn’s flare ups. Many new treatments have been developed that can help treat the same symptoms. Because of this, there may be better treatment options available for you.Talk to your doctor about all treatments available. If you are prescribed steroids, discuss whether or not there is a better option for you.

Buy high quality flaxseeds.,
Grind flaxseeds with a coffee grinder or food processor.,
Add whole flaxseeds to food.,
Sprinkle ground flaxseeds on food.",How to Take Flax Oil2," There are two different varieties of flaxseeds: brown and golden. The price is often significantly different, but the amount of nutrients is about the same. Choose the seed type that is within your price range and that works best for how you plan to use them.

, If you decide to use whole flaxseeds, but you also want to grind them to add to various foods, then you can use a coffee grinder to grind them up. Make sure that you set aside a coffee grinder that is only for grinding flaxseeds. Otherwise, your flaxseeds may end up getting mixed with coffee grounds.Some nutritionists recommend ground over whole flaxseeds because it is easier for your body to digest and use the nutrients in ground flaxseed.Whole flaxseeds tend to be excreted from the body still in tact, thus limiting their benefit.

, You can add up to one tablespoon a day of whole flaxseed your food. Add flaxseeds to cereals, soups, stews, sauces, and salad dressings. You can take the tablespoon all at once (in a morning cereal, for example) or divide it up throughout the day.

, You can also grind flaxseeds and use the ground flaxseed as toppings for cereals, soups, salads, vegetables and stews. Use ½ to one tablespoon of ground flaxseed every day. You can either use it all at once at one meal or divide it up between meals.You can also use the freshly ground flaxseeds as a flour to make muffins, pancakes and breads. Substitute the ground flaxseeds for regular flour— if the recipe calls for one cup of flour, add ½ cup of flour and ½ cup of ground flaxseed.

Pack pills and solid medications in your carry-on luggage.,
Declare liquid medications and medical accessories to the screening officer.,
Bring documentation as a precaution.,
Adjust to time zone changes incrementally.,
Gather detailed information on your medication(s).,
Take special care with narcotics and psychotropics.,
Check for restrictions in your destination country.,
Keep sufficient quantities of your medication in your possession.,
Keep important medications in more than one location.,
Prepare a “travel health kit.” Especially if you are headed on a “road trip” and don’t have to worry about security checkpoints or international law, it can be smart, convenient, and safe to pack a compact but diverse supply of medications and related items.No matter where you’re headed, make your prescription medications the first priority.,
Bring over-the-counter (OTC) medications you use regularly.,
Supplement your kit with first aid supplies and optional items.",How to Travel with Medications," According to the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA), any “reasonable quantities” of pills and similar medications can be carried onto a plane, so long as they are screened along with the rest of your carry-on luggage. You can also put medication in your checked baggage, but it usually makes more sense to keep it accessible.The TSA does not require that pills be in their original packaging or otherwise labeled, but this is your best option and least likely to cause screening delays. State laws regarding the labeling and transportation of prescription medications may require you to keep them in the original, labeled containers as well.
Please note: this article draws from the policies and procedures of the U.S. TSA. Many other nations have the same or similar flight regulations for medications, but check with the relevant authority in your nation of travel.
In addition, be aware that the TSA is governed by federal law, and therefore does not take local laws into account when it comes to substances like medicinal marijuana (meaning if marijuana is legal in your state, it is still viewed as an illegal substance to the TSA). The TSA will not search specifically for marijuana, but if it triggers an alarm during screening, a law enforcement officer will handle the matter.;
, If you are carrying liquid, gel, or cream medications in excess of TSA allowances for liquids (3.4 oz or 1000 ml), you should alert the TSA official before your screening begins and have the medications ready to hand over to him or her. Do the same with medical accessories, such as needles for insulin injections.Liquid medications of 3.4 oz (1000 ml) or less should be treated like other liquids in your carry-on luggage — with all liquid containers placed inside one clear, sealed, quart-sized zip-close bag. Remove the clear bag from your carry-on for screening.Again, the TSA recommends but does not require original containers, but this is the way to go, especially with larger amounts of medication.

, When dealing with medications and flight security, it is always best to go beyond the minimum requirements in your preparation. The more documented information you have regarding the medications you have with you, the more likely you are to have a smoother security screening experience.Consider bringing a printed list of all your medications and doses (especially prescription medications). You may also want to bring along a copy of your actual prescription(s), and any information sheet that came with the medication.
If you have an uncommon prescription medication, or an unusually large amount of one, you may want to bring a signed letter from the prescribing doctor that explains the medication and your need for it., If you need to take the same medication right before dinner each day and are crossing multiple time zones, you will need to adjust your schedule. Discuss the issue with your doctor or pharmacist before leaving to determine the best course of action for making adjustments.Generally speaking, you can incrementally adjust the time you take a medication, perhaps beginning on the flight itself. If you take a pill at 8 pm every day but are heading from New York to Los Angeles (where it would be 5 pm) for an extended stay, you may be able to take the pill one hour later each day for three days to remain on the 8 pm schedule.

, To save yourself from potential inconveniences or even health hazards while abroad, it is a good idea to compile information on each and every medication you bring and/or use, particularly prescription medications. Ideally, you should print out several copies of a single document (in the primary language of the nation you’re visiting, if possible) that lists all your medications (brand and generic names), uses, dosages, and prescription information.Almost all of the time, you will have no problem transporting and using your medications internationally, especially if you keep them in the original packaging and have documentation for your prescriptions. Having additional documentation at the ready can help you in the uncommon instance when there is a problem.
If your medication includes a controlled substance in your home country and/or an injectable medication, you should bring a signed letter from the prescribing physician (on his or her letterhead) that describes the medication and its usage in your case., Prescription medications in these classes, which include painkillers such as morphine and codeine and common drugs for depression, anxiety, and various psychoses, are governed under international law by the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB). According to INCB policy, you should be able to transport at least a thirty day supply of medications in these classes so long as you have a copy of the prescription document.In practice, however, some nations have stricter requirements; Japan and the UAE, for instance, are known for being quite stringent. You may be required to provide extensive documentation, and even then may not be permitted to bring certain medications into the country. The more documentation you have, the better your odds.

, Unfortunately, it can be a real challenge to sort out the official (and unofficial) travel policies regarding medications for individual nations. You can try consulting official websites, but you may be best served by contacting your destination nation’s embassy or consulate in your home nation.The INCB does maintain an extensive list of general medication information and medication entry standards by nation at http://www.incb.org/incb/en/publications/Guidelines.html. It is probably best to use this as a starting point, then try to gather the most up-to-date information directly from your destination country.

, While not always feasible to do so, it is always easier to avoid having to obtain additional quantities of a medication (especially a prescription) in a foreign nation. You will likely have to visit a local physician and get a new prescription, among other challenges. Work ahead of time with your home physician and health insurer to stock up adequate supplies of your prescriptions before leaving.Keep in mind the possible restrictions on how much medication you can bring into a country. Do your homework first.
Keep your medication in your carry-on luggage when flying internationally, just as you should when flying domestically. Keep it in your possession and accessible as much as you can.

, Whether you are driving out of town for a couple of days or heading abroad for a few weeks, losing your entire supply of a necessary medication can be a real headache. When possible, divide up your supply to prepare against theft, destruction, misplacement, etc.As mentioned in the sections of this article dealing with flying and/or traveling internationally, taking medications (especially prescriptions) out of their original packaging can add layers of hassle to the process. If possible, obtain multiple original packages of the medication(s) and place them in different locations (for instance, your carry-on and in your checked luggage). If not possible, place the secondary supply in a clearly marked container with identifying documentation handy.
Don’t put all your important pills in your purse or backpack while out and about, or even in a single place in your hotel. Make sure you have a couple of days’ worth of medications available even if you are a victim of theft.
You may wish to keep your daily medication (or enough for a few days) on your person while traveling, then put the rest in the hotel safe.

, Keep them easy to access and hard to lose. If you have medication for allergic reactions (such as epinephrine, as in an Epi-Pen), be extra sure to have a dose handy when you are away from home.
Keep a printed list of all prescription and other medications you take regularly, with dosages and indications, in your possession when traveling. This way, if you are somehow incapacitated, medical personnel will have this important information more quickly.

, More often than not, you are probably traveling somewhere where you could easily pick up some antacids or anti-itch cream if you need it. However, having a small supply ready to go in your “travel health kit” will make things that much easier — such as, for instance, if you need an anti-diarrheal right away.Base your list on the medications you are most likely to use, but consider including travel-size amounts from among the following: anti-diarrheals, antihistamines, decongestants, motion sickness pills, pain relievers, laxatives, cough suppressants/drops, antacids, antifungals, and anti-itch creams.

, Your needs are likely to vary depending upon whether you are headed to New York City or on a camping trip for the week. Take time to jot down a list of medical supplies and accessories that may be useful to bring along, and add them as space allows to your “travel health kit.”Based on your destination, consider bringing, for instance: insect repellent; sunscreen; hand-sanitizer or antibacterial wipes; lubricating eye drops; basic first aid supplies (first aid reference card, bandages, gauze, ace bandage, antiseptic, tweezers, scissors, cotton-tipped applicators); moleskin for blisters; aloe gel; digital thermometer; oral rehydration solution packets; sleep aids; and water purification tablets.

Educate yourself about glutamine.,
Find natural sources of glutamine.,
Ask your doctor about glutamine supplements.,
Consider different forms of supplements.,
Take the supplement appropriately.,
Know side effects and warnings.",How to Take Glutamine1," Glutamine is an amino acid produced in your body. Amino acids are building blocks of protein which are important for regulating cell growth and function.In particular, glutamine helps remove waste, also known as ammonia, from the body. It also helps your immune and digestive system.


Within the body, glutamine is stored in your muscles and lungs.;
, Your body generally gets the majority of its glutamine by producing the substance itself and through your daily intake of food. However, when your body is under stress, you suffer an injury, or you have an infection, your body may not be able to produce enough. When this happens, there are two ways to get additional glutamine: through food or supplements.


You can get it naturally by supplementing your diet with an increase of glutamine-rich foods. Glutamine is naturally found in high protein foods such as dairy, fish, meat, beans.It can also be found in vegetables like spinach, cabbage, and parsley.Although these foods provide glutamine, they do not provide as much as supplements do.

, If you cannot get enough glutamine through your food, or if you need additional glutamine because of increased stress on your body, ask your doctor about the supplement. The dosages and type you should take can vary greatly depending on what condition for which you are being treated. Your doctor can tell you whether this form of treatment is worth pursuing and can advise you on what quantity of glutamine to take.


Generally, the dosage of the supplement used is 5g to 10g daily, which is usually given in three divided doses a day.However, the doctor may tell you to take up to 14g.
People with medical conditions that may affect excretion of glutamine, such as people with kidney or liver disease, should always ask their doctor before beginning any new supplements.
Glutamine supplements are used for many different issues, however not all of them have strong studies behind them., Although you should ask your doctor about supplements, they are generally available over the counter in pharmacies and health food stores. They usually come as L-glutamine and may be part of a protein supplement. The supplement should state if it is naturally derived or synthetic. A lot of supplements seem to be derived from plant sources so they are vegetarian, but you should always check the label.


Glutamine is available as capsules, a powder, a liquid, and as tablets. The powder and liquid form may be better for those who have trouble swallowing or are using the supplement for stomatitis., There are certain rules you need to follow when taking glutamine. It can be taken with or without meals, but make sure you do not take it with food or drinks that are hot. This is because glutamine is an amino acid which can be affected by temperature. Glutamine should only be taken with cold or room temperature liquids.Glutamine powder or liquid can be mixed with water or juice with a low level of acidity like apple or carrot juice. Taking glutamine with acidic juices (like orange or grapefruit juice) or hot liquids will degrade the glutamate  and therefore diminish any benefits., As glutamine is naturally occurring in the body, it rarely produces any adverse side effects. However, excessive glutamine consumption should be avoided as it can lead to an upset stomach. You should also consult with your doctor before taking glutamine if you have liver or kidney disease, or if you're pregnant or breastfeeding. It may be necessary to decrease your dosage or stop taking glutamine altogether.


It is generally recommend to avoid very high doses of any supplement, including glutamine, unless prescribed by your doctor for specific conditions
Be aware that glutamine is completely different from glutamate, glutamic acid, monosodium glutamate, and gluten. Therefore, people suffering from gluten intolerance do not need to worry about having an adverse reaction to glutamine.
However, in some rare cases, people will experience a bad reaction to glutamine. Symptoms include stomach pain, vomiting, headache, sweating, and joint pain. If this is the case, you should stop taking glutamine immediately and consult your physician."

Use glutamine for wound healing.,
Take glutamine for bodybuilding.,
Increase low levels due to cancer.,
Treat other issues.",How to Take Glutamine2," Supplements are often used to support people who have gone through the stress of a wound. Cortisol, which is a hormone released when the body is stressed due to injury, burns, and infections, causes a decrease in glutamine. Some studies suggest that glutamine supplements help your immune system, which helps you fight against the adverse effects of wounds.Glutamine also helps reduce infections. The innate muscle recovery properties of glutamine also make it extremely effective with patients who have suffered from burns or undergo surgeries., Glutamine is a popular bodybuilding supplement. Just like when the body goes through stress due to injury, your body goes through stress when you build muscle. There is a short-term break down of muscle, and glutamine along with other amino acids are the building blocks of the new muscle that will be built post work out. The common thought is that it helps recharge and strengthen muscles that are overly taxed by exhaustive exercise.Although this is a popular method, there have been no conclusive studies with evidence for its use in bodybuilding., Patients with cancer often have low levels of glutamine as well as other macro- and micronutrients. Due to this deficiency, research is being done as to how glutamine supplementation may help cancer patients. Currently, it is used for malnourished patients who are going through treatment as well as for patients receiving bone marrow transplants.


Some studies indicate it may help with stomatitis, which is an inflammation of the mucosa of the mouth, and diarrhea associated with chemotherapy. , There are a few other conditions that researchers believe are helped by glutamine. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, may be helped by glutamine supplements.This is because glutamine plays a role in protecting the mucosa, which is the lining of GI tract.Take one 5g tablet, six times a day by mouth for up to 16 weeks. The amount of time for this dosage is limited because it is a much higher dosage than normal.


Although there is some evidence that glutamine helps with diarrhea and inflammation of mucosa near the mouth, studies have not yet shown that it helps with other digestive conditions such as Crohn's disease.Glutamine may also be helpful in promoting weight gain in patients with HIV/AIDS. A few studies indicate that glutamine, in addition to other supplements, may lead to weight gain and an increase in muscle mass. This is helpful since patients with HIV/AIDS often suffer severe weight and muscle loss. In addition, it may help these patients absorb nutrients better, which is a consideration with this condition."

Talk to your doctor about how much iron you should be consuming each day.,
Familiarize yourself with medical conditions that may cause you to need more iron than normal.,
Choose the form of supplement you would like to take.,
Consider increasing your iron intake through food, rather than taking supplements.,
Avoid taking too much iron.,
Keep track of the two month mark.,
Talk to your doctor about any medications you are taking before you begin taking iron supplements.,
Try your supplements at the beginning of the day when your stomach is empty.,
Try drinking orange juice when you take your supplement.,
Avoid certain foods when you take your supplements.,
Avoid certain supplements when you take your supplements.,
Watch out for staining on your teeth.,
Talk to your doctor about reducing the amount of iron supplement you take if you feel nauseous.,
Take a stool softener if you become constipated but cannot stop taking your iron supplements.,
Keep track of your stools.",How to Take Iron Supplements," The amount of iron you should consume each day is determined by many factors, including general health, your gender, and your age. It is a good idea to talk to your doctor about how much iron you specifically should be getting, given your medical history and personal information.


Women generally need more iron than men. The general amount is 18 mg, while men 18 years and older generally need 8 mg a day.Children generally need more iron than adults. In addition to this, as women age and reach menopause, they generally need less iron than they used to. They commonly need 8 mg or so.;
, Some conditions will keep your body from absorbing iron efficiently, which may mean that you need to take supplements in order to get enough iron each day. These conditions include:


Kidney diseases
Crohn’s disease
Celiac disease
Pregnancy
Ulcerative colitis

, Iron supplements come in several different forms. Generally, the form of supplement that you take is up to you and your preferences. The different forms include:


Tablets (both chewable and non-chewable)
Capsules
Liquid

, Of course, if your doctor has told you that you need to take the supplements, do as he or she says. If you are choosing to take iron supplements on your own however, try eating iron-rich foods before you spend your money on the supplements. Foods that are rich in iron include:


Red meat like beef.
Leaner meats like poultry and fish.
Fortified cereals and grains.
Beans.
Green, leafy vegetables like kale or spinach.
Dried fruits.

, The general rule is that you should limit your iron intake to 45 mg a day unless you have a severe medical condition and your doctor prescribes further supplementation. Luckily, your body has a system in place that regulates how much iron your body absorbs. Despite this fact, some people have systems that do not work as well. Signs of iron toxicity include:


Vomiting, nausea and diarrhea
Dehydration
Cramps or abdominal pain
Blood in your stool

, Iron deficiencies tend to clear up after two months of supplementation. However, this does not mean that you should stop taking your iron supplements.


Your doctor will most likely recommend that you continue to take iron supplements for 12 more months. Doing this can help to make sure that iron stores in your blood marrow get larger.

, Some medications do not mix well with iron supplements. In particular, iron can make the following medications less effective:


Penicillin, ciprofloxacin, and tetracycline. You should talk to your doctor before taking iron supplements, regardless of what medication are you are taking.
The chances that the iron will affect your medications are reduced when you wait to take your medication two hours after you have taken your iron supplement.

, It is thought that your body is more efficient at absorbing iron when you have not eaten anything.


However, some people find that taking iron on an empty stomach makes their stomach hurt, and can even cause stomach cramps. If you find this to be the case, eat a small amount of food before you take your supplement so that you don’t feel nauseous.

, Vitamin C is thought to help your body absorb iron. Because of this, drinking a glass of orange juice when you take your iron supplement can help your body to process your supplement more efficiently.You could also try taking a vitamin C supplement along with your iron supplement.
You can also try eating foods that are rich in vitamin C. These foods include citrus fruits like oranges and grapefruits, veggies like peppers and broccoli, and green leafy vegetables.

, While foods rich in vitamin C can help your body absorb iron, other foods can hinder your body’s ability to do so. These foods include:


Foods or drink that have a lot of caffeine in them, like coffee, black tea, and chocolate.
Foods that are high in fiber. This includes some vegetables like collard greens and spinach, bran products, and whole grain items like bread or brown rice.
You should also avoid drinking milk, or eating milk products at the same time as you take your iron supplements.

, Calcium and antacid supplements can interrupt your body’s uptake of your iron supplement. Because of this, you should try to wait at least two hours before you take either of these supplements, once you have taken your iron supplements for the day.

, Some iron supplements that come in liquid form can sadly stain your teeth and give them a blackish tinge. Luckily, these stains can be combated by brushing your teeth with baking soda-based toothpaste (or just plain baking soda).


Another way to minimize the amount of staining that occurs is to drink your supplement through a straw. This limits the amount of time that the supplement spends against your teeth.
You could also talk to your doctor about potentially switching to a different form of supplement, such as a tablet.

, If you are taking a high dose of iron supplement, you may begin to feel a little queasy. You may be able to combat this feeling by switching to a different form of iron, eating food when you take your supplement, or taking a smaller amount.


However, it is very important that you talk to your doctor before you change anything about your supplement regimen.

, If you are taking your iron supplements because of a medical condition and cannot stop taking them, or take less of them, then you may need to take a medication to make passing stool easier. Some common constipation medications include:


Amitiza
Colace
GlycoLax
Metamucil

, While this may sound like something you really don’t want to do, iron can affect the way your stools look. These supplements will often turn your stool black, which is completely normal. However, there are some things that may indicate that there is a problem. These things may include:


Red or bloody stools
Soreness in your stomach when you go to the bathroom

Know what Cytomel treats.,
Think about your symptoms and whether you need Cytomel.,
Consult your doctor.,
Discuss the basics of Cytomel use with your doctor.,
Take your Cytomel exactly as prescribed.,
Inform your family and close friends of your condition.,
Learn about using Cytomel.,
Monitor your body's reactions to your medication.,
Tell your doctor if you experience side effects.",How to Take Cytomel," Cytomel is the brand name for liothyronine, which is sometimes prescribed by doctors to treat hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine is more commonly prescribed, but some people have to take liothyronine instead. Hypothyroidism describes a condition in which a person’s thyroid gland is unable to create the proper amount of thyroid hormone. In addition:


Cytomel can be used to decrease enlarged thyroid glands which are commonly known as goiters.
Hypothyroidism is when thyroid glands do not create enough thyroid hormone. This is different from hyperthyroidism which is a condition in which thyroid glands produce too much thyroid hormone.
Cytomel works by increasing the patient’s metabolic system. After taking Cytomel for a few weeks, your cellular activity will increase, and your body will begin to use carbs, fats, and proteins more efficiently. Liothyronine helps balance metabolism, so people sometimes try to take it to boost energy or for weight loss. However, this is not recommended due to serious and fatal effects liothyronine can have if it is not indicated or monitored.;
, There are a number of specific symptoms that will indicate whether you suffer from hypothyroidism and need to take Cytomel. When considering if you need Cytomel, think about whether you have the following symptoms:


Fatigue.
Increased sensitivity to cold.
Constipation.
Dry skin.
Thinning hair.
Depressed mood.
Weight gain
Heavy or irregular menses in women
Puffy face., Only your doctor can determine if your symptoms and overall health are indicative of hypothyroidism and can be addressed through the use of Cytomel. As a result, you should speak to your doctor immediately if you think that you may suffer from hypothyroidism or another life threatening disorder or condition. Your doctor will:


Review your symptoms.
Review your medical history.
Take diagnostics in order to gather an idea of your overall health.

, After your doctor determines that you need Cytomel and prescribes it for you, you should spend a little time talking to him or her about the basics of Cytomel use. This will include a number of things:


Ask your doctor about the ingredients in Cytomel. You should not start taking the medication if you are allergic to any of them.
Discuss family planning options. If you plan to become pregnant, or if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, this medication may have an effect on the fetus or child.
Talk to your doctor about heart disease, prescriptions, dietary supplements or herbal preparations. Birth control pills, estrogen, anticoagulants, digitalis, ketamine, tricyclic antidepressants or vasopressor medications' side effects may be multiplied by Cytomel. Insulin or other diabetes medications may become less effective.
Ask about any planned surgeries you have coming up., Once you’ve been prescribed your Cytomel, you need to take it exactly as your doctor prescribes it. Disregarding your doctor’s orders can endanger your health or at the very least undermine the efficacy of your treatment. Consider:


Take the medication by mouth with food or without, at the same time every day.
Separate your daily dosage of this medication by at least 4 hours from preparations containing calcium salts--sucralfate, calcium carbonate or cholestyramine.
Take your dose of medication as soon as you can, if you have forgotten to take it. Skip the dose if it is nearly time for the next one.

, After you’ve begun your treatment with Cytomel, make sure to inform your family and friends of your condition and treatment. This is important because if something happens to you and you are debilitated, doctors will need to know what medications you are taking.


Tell anyone you live with about your condition and treatment.
Explain to friends and family what the medicine is and where it is stored.
Consider getting a medical bracelet with important information., Treatment with Cytomel is both similar to and different from an array of other treatments for metabolic disorders and conditions. However, before you begin treatment with Cytomel, you should learn about the specifics of treatment. Do not take your treatment for granted or embark on it without knowing what you are in store for.


Due to the nature of the conditions Cytomel is prescribed to treat, Cytomel often needs to be taken for the rest of a person’s life.
Cytomel is often prescribed as a medicine taken orally.
Cytomel may take several weeks of usage before benefits start to materialize.
Normal prescriptions range from 25 micrograms to 75 micrograms taken once a day, for mild hypothyroidism.
Normal prescriptions range from 5 micrograms to 25 micrograms, taken several times a day for myxedema.
Prescriptions for children vary., It is crucial to monitor the effects of liothyronine on your body using regular blood tests. This drug will not be prescribed unless you have hypothyroidism, which requires a blood test to be diagnosed. An important part of taking a drug like Cytomel is monitoring your body’s reaction. This is important for a couple reasons. First, you’ll want to make sure that the drug is doing what it is intended to do. Second, you’ll want to make sure there are no adverse reactions to the medicine.


Check your blood sugars as dictated by your doctor if you are diabetic. Cytomel may affect your blood sugar level.
Undergo lab tests regularly if you take blood thinners. Your blood thinner dosage may need adjustment.
Receive lab tests--including thyroid function tests--on a regular basis. This is very important to ensure that the drug is working properly and to determine if your dosage might need to be adjusted.

, Knowing about side effects, taking proper dosage, and monitoring your body is not the end of your work when it comes to taking Cytomel. As a result, you need to make sure report all side effects to your doctor as soon as you experience them. Waiting could cause you harm and prolong the period that it takes for your doctor to remedy the problem.


Tell your doctor if you experience partial hair loss after starting Cytomel. This hair loss is usually temporary.
Alert your doctor right away if you develop chest pain, diarrhea, weight change, excessive sweating, difficulty breathing, headache, the inability to tolerate heat or hot weather conditions, an increased heart rate, irregular heartbeat, cramps in your legs, pounding in your chest, nervousness, tremors, shortness of breath or vomiting."

See your doctor and get tested for thyroid hormone.,
Understand the results of your blood test.,
Ask your doctor about the different medications.,
Tell your doctor about other medications you're taking.,
Get your dose figured out by your doctor.,
Take the medication in the morning.,
Don't take the medication with food.,
Drink a glass of water with the medication.,
Store your thyroid medication appropriately.,
Do not stop taking your medication.",How to Take Thyroid Medication," The thyroid gland is sensitive to many things, including dietary factors as well as emotional and physical stressors, so hypothyroidism is a relatively common condition — particularly in women. If you experience chronic (daily) fatigue, unexplained weight gain, dry skin, coarse hair, depression and uncharacteristic moodiness, then schedule an appointment with your family doctor to get checked out.


The best way to check for hypothyroidism is to get a blood test and look at your level of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).TSH is the hormone your pituitary gland (in your brain) secretes to tell your thyroid how much thyroid hormone to make.
A lack of iodine in your diet can cause your thyroid to swell (called a goiter) and lead to hypothyroidism.;
, If your thyroid gland is underactive or dysfunctional for some reason, your pituitary gland will tell your thyroid to work harder, which is indicated by increased levels of TSH in your bloodstream.So the higher your TSH blood levels, the lower your thyroid gland activity.


Normal blood TSH values are 0.5 to 4.5/5 mIU/L (milli-international units per liter).
If your TSH level is greater than 10 mIU/L, then most doctors agree that treatment with thyroid medication (synthetic or natural) is appropriate.
If your TSH level is between 4 - 10 mIU/L, medication may still be recommended if your actual thyroid hormones — thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) — are abnormally low.

, Once your doctor establishes you have hypothyroidism, there are different types of medications to consider. The main medication used is called levothyroxine sodium (Synthroid, Levoxyl, Levothroid, Unithroid), which is a synthetic version of thyroxine (T4).Other commonly used thyroid medications include liothyronine (Cytomel), a synthetic version of triiodothyronine (T3); liotrix (Thyrolar), a synthetic combo of T4 and T3; and desiccated natural thyroid (Armour Thyroid, Nature-throid, Westhroid).


Desiccated natural thyroid hormone is made from dried pig thyroid glands.
Depending on many factors, including which thyroid hormones are too low in your bloodstream (T4 and/or T3), your doctor will recommend the most appropriate thyroid medication.
All these thyroid medications are supplementing a hormone(s) that's at low levels in your body, so your body won't react negatively to them. The safety concern is getting the right dose for your body. There may be a period of adjustment to get the dosage right, so your doctor may need to see you more in the beginning. Be aware of the signs of too little medication and too much medication.

, Remember to tell your doctor about any over-the-counter or prescription drugs you're taking because some types can negatively interact with your thyroid medication. Other drugs to watch out for include oral contraceptives, hormone therapy (estrogen, testosterone), some anti-seizure medications, cholesterol-lowering drugs (statins), blood pressure medications, some cardiac medications, and many antidepressants.If you take any of these drugs it doesn't mean you can't take thyroid medication, but your doctor may have to alter dosages or schedules so side effects are minimized.
Most interactive drugs need to be taken at least 4 hours before taking your thyroid medication.Some food (soy and dairy products in particular) and supplements (especially calcium and iron) also affect the absorption and effectiveness of thyroid medication. Horseradish and lemon balm can also affect how well your body absorbs the medication, therefore it is suggested to take your thyroid medicine on an empty stomach.

, When starting on thyroid medication for hypothyroidism, your doctor will decide on the initial dosage based on information such as your blood test results, weight, age and other medical conditions you might have.The dose will then be adjusted from time to time based on regular check-ups that consist of physical examinations and more blood tests.


If you suddenly gain or lose a significant amount of weight (more than 10 pounds) inform your doctor as soon as you can because it might affect your dosage of thyroid medication.
Because treatment for hypothyroidism is highly individualized and monitored carefully by your doctor, you'll get your TSH measured 4 - 8 weeks after starting treatment or changing dosages.Once stabilized, you'll get a blood test every 6-12 months to check for TSH, T4 and T3 levels.
Once you start on a particular type and brand name of thyroid medication, stay with it. If a change is unavoidable or preferred for economic reasons, tell your doctor beforehand.

, Taking your thyroid medication in the morning is suggested, but not required. Thyroid hormonal medications come in pill form and are easy to take. They stay in your system for a long time because they're not quickly metabolized, so you take them just once daily. Although there's some debate on the topic, many doctors feel the best time to take thyroid medication is probably first thing in the morning soon after rising.It's easiest to establish a routine first thing in the morning and it stabilizes your hormone levels throughout the day.


Some research indicates that taking thyroid medication before going to bed increases thyroid hormones and lowers TSH more effectively compared to a morning dosage schedule.Taking thyroid medication at night may be more convenient if you're on other medications and need to space them apart by at least 4 hours.
Regardless of when you take your thyroid medication, take it at the same time every day.
If you forget to take your thyroid pill, take it as soon as you remember if within 12 hours of your regular time. If over 12 hours, simply skip the forgotten dose.

, Regardless of when you actually take your thyroid medication, take it on an empty stomach because food may affect its absorption and make it less effective or potent.In general, wait at least 30 minutes to one hour after taking your thyroid pill before eating breakfast or any other meal. If you've eaten first, wait at least 2 hours before taking your thyroid pill.


Aside from not combining your pills with food, there are no other dietary restrictions while on thyroid medication.Taking your thyroid medication at night may be more convenient to prevent food interactions in the morning.

, Take thyroid medication (especially levothyroxine sodium or Levoxyl) with lots of fluid because the tablets tend to dissolve very quickly and can swell in the back of your throat in response to saliva and cause gagging or choking.As such, take the tablets with a large glass of water (about 8 ounces) in order to wash them down without incident.


Stick with purified water and don't wash the tablets down with juice, milk or coffee because it make affect how they are absorbed.
Don't use excessively cold water because it may cause your throat to constrict a little (become more narrow) and make it more difficult to swallow the tablets.

, Keep your thyroid medication in the container it came in and keep the lid tightly closed and out of the reach of your kids. Store the medication at regular room temperature and away from excessive heat or moisture — for example, not in your bathroom and not in a windowsill.Throw away the thyroid medication if it's outdated — ask a pharmacist about the best and safest way to dispose of your medication.


Thyroid medication tends to have a strong odor, so it doesn't mean that it's spoiled or outdated and can't be used.
Check the expiry date on the package of your medication and ask your doctor for a new prescription if you notice it's outdated.

, Never go off of your thyroid medication without your physician’s direct order and observation. Physical ramifications and problems most likely will result and could cause life threatening problems.

Remember that thyroid replacement therapy is usually for a lifetime.
Report any unusual bleeding, bruising, chest pain, palpitations, sweating, nervousness, or shortness of breath to your physician immediately. If you become pregnant, then report that to your physician as your dose may have to be adjusted.

Do your own research on Creatine such as the effects it has on the body and how it can enhance your physical performance.,
Decide by which method you wish to take creatine by such as by powder or by capsule.,
Find a brand that is trustworthy and high quality.,
Once you have your product in hand ensure that you carefully read the instructions and any other information provided on the product.,
Understand that it is not necessary to take creatine day-in-day out.",How to Take Creatine for Bodybuilding," There is a sea full of information available on the backgrounds of creatine that can be easily accessed over the internet.;
, You can always seek advice from a professional who can tell you what is best and what will suit your needs.

, Don't opt for cheaper brands as you won't be getting the high quality creatine which is important to your physical health. Use the internet to find a brand that other people have reviewed as high quality e.g Optimum Nutrition. Once you choose a brand make a purchase either over the internet or in your local nutrition store. When you have chosen your brand ensure you purchase the same one again so that you aren't mixing different brands.

, Some products state that you should do a creatine 'loading phase' for a certain amount of days so that your body will be 'saturated' with creatine. This is not entirely necessary as your body does not need this phase in order to get to the 'saturated' state. Taking the product 5g-10g a day should be enough for you to benefit from taking it.

, Constantly supplementing with creatine can put stress on the liver and kidneys and can lead to problems. Only take creatine in stages such as 2 months on and 2 months off to give your body a rest from supplementation. Use it particularly when building up to a competition such as a race or heavy powerlifting session.

Consult with your doctor about aspirin therapy.,
Discuss all the medications and supplements you take.,
Follow dosing instructions carefully.,
Recognize possible allergies and side effects.,
Learn about how aspirin therapy works.,
Identify the risks of aspirin therapy.,
Know your risk level for heart attack and stroke.,
Keep up with new developments.",How to Take Aspirin Daily," Aspirin is such a familiar product that it may seem harmless to just take a “baby” (81 mg) tablet daily on your own; however, for all the good that little daily aspirin can potentially do, it can also cause serious, even possibly fatal, problems. Do not start taking a daily aspirin on your own. Always talk to your doctor first.Just because your sister or co-worker or second cousin takes a daily aspirin for heart protection purposes does not necessarily mean it is right for you. As with most every medical treatment, an individualized comparison of risks and benefits should take place. You need to work with your doctor to make this determination in regards to yourself.
Even if you just want to take aspirin occasionally for pain relief, it is a smart move to consult your doctor first.;
, Aspirin thins the blood, which is beneficial in reducing the risk of heart attack or stroke; but this quality also makes it a potentially dangerous combination with other blood thinning-substances. Blood that will not coagulate (or clot) properly can lead to a host of dangerous internal and external bleeding problems.Taking another blood-thinning substance does not automatically mean you can’t or shouldn’t also take a daily aspirin; however, it is reason for more caution and close observation.
The following list of medications and supplements that can thin the blood is far from exhaustive; it is very important that you tell your doctor about all medications and supplements you take. Take particular care to mention items such as:

Other anticoagulant medications, like warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven), apixaban (Eliquis), dabigatran (Pradaxa), or rivaroxaban (Xarelto).
Heparin; ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, etc.), when taken regularly; corticosteroids; clopidogrel (Plavix); certain antidepressants, including clomipramine, paroxetine, and others.
Bilberry; capsaicin; cat's claw; danshen; evening primrose oil; ginkgo; kava; ma-huang; omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil).



, If your doctor recommends an aspirin regimen, she should provide a specific dosing schedule and instructions. Use this information first, and the package instructions for the aspirin secondarily, to establish how and when to take your aspirin.The most common dosing for a daily aspirin regimen is one 81 mg tablet, sometimes still called a “baby aspirin;” however, your dosing could range from 75 mg to 325 mg (a regular strength tablet).
Unless otherwise instructed, take your dosage at about the same time each day, and take any missed doses as soon as possible (on the other hand, if it is close to the time of your next dose, skip the missed one — don’t “double up”). Don’t crush or chew coated tablets or caplets, and don’t swallow chewable tablets whole. Don’t take the aspirin with alcohol, and ask about instructions regarding taking it with or without food.
If you are on a daily aspirin regimen, never stop without telling your doctor first. Once you stop, a “rebound” effect can occur and actually increase your risk of heart attack or stroke., Most people can take a daily aspirin with no noticeable side effects; however, some people develop potentially serious allergic reactions, and some may experience significant — even life-threatening — side effects. Make sure you are familiar with common reactions to aspirin, and always contact your doctor if you suspect you are experiencing one or more of them.An aspirin allergy will typically present with familiar signs of an allergic reaction, such as hives, breathing trouble, and/or swelling of the face, lips, tongue, etc. Seek medical assistance immediately.
You may experience a mild upset stomach or heartburn, or a mild headache or tiredness when taking aspirin. Stop taking the medication and call your doctor if you experience:

Ringing in your ears, confusion, hallucinations, rapid breathing, or seizure (convulsions).
Severe nausea, vomiting, or stomach pain.
Bloody or tarry stools, or coughing up blood or vomit that looks like coffee grounds.
Fever lasting longer than three days, or swelling or pain lasting longer than 10 days.



, Aspirin is an effective preventative measure against heart attack and stroke because of the impact it has upon the blood. When you hear that aspirin “thins the blood,” what that means is that it reduces the clumping action of platelets, which are the part of the blood that creates clots.Clots that form within arteries and blood vessels (especially those narrowed by plaque buildup) can cause heart attacks and strokes by blocking off blood flow to critical organs. A daily aspirin reduces the risk of such clots forming.

, Clotting within blood vessels can be very bad, but so too can the inability of your blood to coagulate properly when bleeding occurs (externally or internally). The increased risk of uncontrolled bleeding, especially internally, is the major risk factor of aspirin therapy for most people.If you have a clotting disorder due to heredity, illness, or another medication, the risks of taking aspirin will likely outweigh any possible rewards. For instance, if you experience occasional bleeding stomach ulcers, your doctor is unlikely to recommend daily aspirin.
Although some physicians and researchers believe that it would be beneficial overall if virtually every adult took a daily aspirin, current recommendations by major health and medical organizations accept that the bleeding risks are too great to recommend aspirin for those at low risk for heart attack or stroke.

, In the end, the determination of whether you should be on a daily aspirin regimen usually boils down to comparing your risk for heart attack or stroke to your risk for serious internal bleeding. People tend to overvalue the former due to fear of a heart attack and underestimate the dangers of the latter. It is therefore essential that you work with your doctor to determine your personal risk assessment.


According to the most recent recommendations of the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF), all people ages 50–59 who have a ten percent or more increased likelihood of having a heart attack or stroke in the next ten years, and who do not have elevated risk factors for bleeding, should probably be on daily aspirin. Otherwise, the determination needs to be made according to individual risk levels.More generally speaking, if you are a man over age 45 or a woman over 55, have elevated heart attack or stroke risks, and don’t have elevated bleeding risks, aspirin may be right for you. If you are not at an elevated risk (less than ten percent above average) for a heart attack, lifestyle changes should probably be your first option., Recommendations regarding aspirin therapy change regularly, as new findings shift the overall risk-reward balance. Don’t stop or start an aspirin regimen because you hear about some new study on the news; always work with your doctor.


As one example of recent developments, there is increasing evidence that aspirin may help cut the risk of developing certain cancers, and may also help slow the spread of some existing cancers. The USPSTF factors this possible benefit (in regards to colon cancer in particular) into its recommendation about who should take daily aspirin, but the research is still too preliminary for general recommendations to be made regarding the use of aspirin to combat cancer."

Stop taking bee pollen if you experience any adverse side effects or reactions.",How to Take Bee Pollen," Bees gather pollen from flowering plants as they search for nectar in various flowers. Bee pollen contains the gametes—male reproductive cells of flowers—as well as bees' digestive enzymes.Natural bee pollen contains vitamins and minerals in addition to trace elements, enzymes, and amino acids. The exact composition of bee pollen, however, varies depending on the plant from which the pollen was gathered. It is difficult to track the plant source of all bee pollen, and, as a result, the amount of healthy elements in bee pollen is hard to determine. Pollen taken from plants growing in areas affected by toxins and heavy metal contamination may still carry these toxins, and can be detrimental when consumed.Many physicians feel the benefits of bee pollen for humans are outweighed by the dangers associated with its use. Many bee pollen supplements also contain other chemicals or products that can cause negative side effects or allergic reactions.;
, Some people may be allergic to ingested pollen and their allergic reactions could range in seriousness from mild to fatal. Wheezing, skin discomfort and a rash are all possible signs of a reaction to bee pollen. Anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction that causes swollen airways and shock, can also occur.If you are susceptible to allergies or asthma, avoid consuming bee pollen.

, Studies have found substances that may cause liver damage, and renal failure in bee pollen. The popular notion that bee pollen is a “superfood” and “naturally good for you” is a false one, as many natural foods can contain toxins that are not good for your body.The safety of bee pollen for young children and pregnant women is not conclusive. It is recommended that young children and pregnant women avoid consuming bee pollen as there is no medical evidence to suggest it is safe to consume.Bee pollen is popular among athletes for being “ergogenic”, which means it enhances athletic performance. But there is no scientific evidence that bee pollen has any ergogenic qualities., According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), several bee pollen weight loss products have been found to contain chemicals and additives that can cause serious heart issues, stroke, chest pain, seizures, suicidal thoughts, insomnia, and diarrhea. The FDA has received more than 50 reports of serious health issues caused by tainted bee pollen weight loss products, and is currently testing other bee pollen weight loss products for undeclared drugs that could put consumers at risk.Avoid the following tainted weight loss products: Zi Xiu Tang, Ultimate Formula, Fat Zero, Bella Vi Amp'd Up, Insane Amp'd Up, Slim Trim U, Infinity, Perfect Body Solution, Asset Extreme, Asset Extreme Plus, Asset Bold, and Asset Bee Pollen.You should also be wary of bee pollen weight loss products that make unproven claims about treating or preventing obesity, allergies, high blood pressure, and cholesterol.
There may be risks associated with bee pollen supplements in general. The FDA monitors the safety of dietary supplements, but it does not require supplements to adhere to certain guidelines or standards before it is available on the market. The FDA also does not assume liability for the contamination of natural supplements, so a great deal of responsibility is left up to the manufacturer and the consumer.Several natural bee pollen supplements have been red flagged by the FDA.It’s important to research information on the ingredients in the supplement and the possible health risks reported by other consumers or the FDA as a result of the supplement.

, Look online for a list of ingredients or check the manufacturer’s label.Confirm the product does not contain toxic materials like mercury, metal shavings, and pesticides. You should also check that there are no filler ingredients like cellulose, caramel color and titanium dioxide in the product.
Though the supplement may claim to be “all natural.” this doesn’t necessarily mean it is safe to consume. If the supplement says “natural flavors,” this could mean monosodium-glutamate (MSG) has been added. Many people suffer from severe allergies to MSG and it should not be included in a reputable dietary supplement.
You should also look for any “mold inhibitors” or “chemicals to promote color retention.” These are in fact chemical preservatives that could be harmful when consumed.

, A reputable producer or manufacturer should be able to provide evidence that the supplement is pure and in fact “all natural.” Ask the company if they provide a certificate of analysis (COA) for each batch of products.The certificate of analysis is issued after independent labs perform tests to verify the active ingredients in the supplement and the purity of the product. The certificate ensures the company is selling high-quality supplements.
Find out the current batch number of the supplement that you are researching and request a COA for the batch. Check the COA for a list of levels of heavy metals and micro-biological contamination in the product batch. Some companies have COAs available on their website. You can also ask your local health food store or vendor if they maintain current COAs for bee pollen supplements.

, Talk to the manufacturer or check the manufacturer’s label to determine where the bee pollen in the product is sourced. A major concern when choosing bee pollen supplements is the amount of pollution the pollen has been exposed to. Bee pollen soaks up pollution from the air, as well as chemicals in the environment. When the pollen is produced in cities that are industrialized, it absorbs any toxic chemicals in the air.The leading sources of bee pollen are: the United States, Canada, China, and Australia. Avoid taking supplements with bee pollen from China, as many areas of the country have severe air pollution.

, These products should be available in health food stores, and they can also be ordered online. Bee pollen should not be processed or heat dried, as heat removes essential nutrients and enzymes in the pollen. Freeze-dried bee pollen should be considered a superior form of the product.Though there is no scientific evidence that bee pollen can treat particular diseases, conditions, or provide nutritional benefits, purchasing freeze-dried bee pollen ensures you are receiving pollen that has not been sapped of any health benefits.

, Because the health benefits of bee pollen have not been confirmed or supported by the medical community, talk to your doctor about any possible side effects before you take a bee pollen supplement. Your doctor may be able to give you information on other medically confirmed treatments for your condition or issue. She may also suggest lifestyle or dietary changes that may be more effective than bee pollen supplements. If you have allergic asthma or any blood disorders or liver disease, bee pollen may not be safe for you to take. Your doctor can advise you if this is the case., If you are taking any other supplements or any prescription medication, speak with a doctor or pharmacist about drug interaction. Some medications and supplements, when taken together, can produce unwanted side-effects. If anything you are taking has a potential interaction issue with bee pollen, your doctor or pharmacist should be able to tell you., If you do decide to use bee pollen, you should begin by taking a small dose to ensure you will not have an adverse reaction. You can increase your dose gradually to make sure it is safe for you. You can begin with 1/8 teaspoon per day, increasing by 1/8 teaspoon up to six teaspoons.

, If you experience any symptoms of an allergic reaction or a negative reaction to bee pollen, stop taking it right away. Speak to your doctor about treatment for your allergic reaction. Bee pollen may actually aggravate allergy sufferers if they are allergic to any of the pollens in the supplement."

If at all possible, let your employer know that you are sick and need to take a couple days off work. If you do need to work, try to minimize your tasks and stress as much as possible.

Not going to work when you’re sick is kind to your fellow employees. Tell your employer you don’t want to spread germs.;
, When you are sick, sleeping allows your body to recover. Let yourself sleep for as long as you need. If you can’t sleep, stay in bed and rest as much as possible.You can also do relaxing activities in bed like reading, doing a crossword puzzle, or journaling.

, If you have a common cold with symptoms such as a runny nose or sneezing, exercising moderately may help you feel better. It can, for instance, clear your nasal passage. Try walking instead of running, and take breaks whenever you feel that you need them.If you have symptoms of a fever or the flu, such as an upset stomach or a hacking cough, avoid exercising. It could make your symptoms worse.

, If you have a cold or cough, place a humidifier near your bed. Humidifiers add moisture to the air, which can help soothe the symptoms of a cold. You want the humidity level to be between 30 and 50 percent.Be sure to keep your humidifier clean and make sure that the humidity level isn’t set too high. Having a dirty humidifier or a level that is too high can breed bacteria and make you more sick.

, Having your phone and computer nearby may tempt you to work or scroll endlessly through social media. To resist that temptation, and to truly be able to rest, keep your computer and phone in a different area than where you are resting, or turn them off. Screen time also causes eye strain, and scrolling through a smartphone can increase feelings of nausea. Give yourself the gift of a screen-time break., To help you relax and possibly sleep, close the curtains in the room you’re in and dim the lights. Consider moving a lamp to your bedside table so that you can turn it off and on without needing to get up., Get lots of plump pillows for your bed, and load up with warm blankets. You want your bed to be inviting and cozy while you recover. Put on pajamas or even a onesie and warm socks while you rest to maximize your coziness., It is very important to keep yourself hydrated while you’re sick, and warm drinks can help soothe your throat and stomach. Consider adding honey to warm water or tea for an additional soothing effect.

, In addition to warm drinks, make sure you drink lots of water or sports drinks with electrolytes. Being sick can make you dehydrated, so drinking fluids is very important., You can get Vitamin C through taking supplements or from drinking orange juice., Some studies show that echinacea can reduce the duration of a cold and lessen the severity of symptoms. When taking echinacea, use a tincture instead of the dried herb, as the drying process makes it less effective. Take 1-2 teaspoons of an echinacea tincture every 2-4 hours when you feel yourself getting a cold., Zinc is believed to help reduce the length of a cold. Take zinc lozenges or zinc syrup in the first 24 hours of your cold. There are some known side effects for taking zinc, so consider talking to your doctor before using this method. Zinc is considered safe when it is taken by mouth in the following doses:Ask a pediatrician if it is safe for your child under 4 to take zinc.
12 milligrams daily for children 4-8 years old
23 milligrams daily for children 9-13 years old
34 milligrams daily for children 14-18 years old
40 milligrams daily for adults 19 years old and older

, Cocoa, or chocolate, contains a chemical called theobromine, which is believed to help fight the symptoms of a common cold. Given this, you can treat yourself to some chocolate while you’re sick without any guilt., If these symptoms are causing you to suffer, consider taking ibuprofen or acetaminophen, which is in Tylenol. These can help to reduce your fever and muscle aches as you heal., If you have a severe and painful cough, try taking an over-the-counter cough syrup, or eating honey. Honey has been shown to be as effective as some common cough-suppressant ingredients.

Understand what causes sciatica.,
Familiarize yourself with the symptoms of sciatica.,
Know how sciatica is diagnosed.",How to Workout with Sciatica," Strengthening the core is essential in both the treatment and prevention of a slipped disc, and the accompanying sciatic pain. A strong and solid core helps to protect the spine from misalignment or injury, as the core muscles will keep the sciatic nerve in its proper place.


The core also stabilizes the spine against any twisting motions and reduces the effect of daily wear and tear on the spine. As the core strengthens, you should no longer feel a one-sided shooting leg pain, which is one of the most common complaints of sciatica.
The core muscles include the abs and transversus abdominis, obliques and the erector spinae muscle. These muscles are located at the front, side, and back of the abdomen and encase the spine. See below for some specific exercises you can do to strengthen the core muscles.;
, The plank is one of the best exercises for relieving sciatic pain caused by a slip disk, as it keeps the spine in proper alignment and prevents the disc from slipping further. To correctly perform the plank exercise:


Assume a traditional push-up position on a soft surface such as a mat. The head, shoulder blades, and butt must form one straight horizontal line. The hands should be directly under the shoulders and feet are kept together.
Brace your abdominal muscles as if you were preparing to be punched in the gut. Hold this position for 15 seconds, making sure that your hips do not drop down at any point during the exercise. Breathe deeply as you perform the exercise, this will prevent your blood pressure from spiking.
There should be no pain, numbness, or tingling sensations throughout the exercise. If you feel any of these symptoms, rest for 15 minutes then try the modified plank position, which involves holding yourself up with your elbows and knees, rather than your hand and feet.
Do 3 sets of 15-second holds, resting for 30 seconds in between each set. Work your way up to doing 30-second and then 1 minute-holds.

, Once you have built up the core doing regular planks (meaning that you can comfortably hold the plank position for 30 seconds) you can progress onto side planks. This exercise is great for strengthening the oblique muscles and helps to prevent sciatic leg pain, especially during twisting movements.


Lie down on your left side, keeping your body in a straight line. Lift yourself up so your entire body weight is being supported by your left elbow and the outer side of your left foot. You body should form a straight diagonal line from your head to your foot.
As you hold this position, keep your hips elevated above the ground with the aid of your left oblique muscles. Remember to keep your abs tight, as if you were bracing yourself for a punch in the stomach. Hold this position for 15 seconds.
You shouldn't experience any pain, numbness, or tingling when performing the side plank exercise. If you do, rest for 15 minutes then try the modified side plank position.
To do the modified side plank, you will bend your knees instead of keeping them straight, so you will be supporting your weight with your left elbow and left knee.
Do 3 sets of 15-second holds, resting for 30 seconds in between. Switch sides and do 3 more repetitions on your right. Work your way up to 30-second holds.

, Hip thrusts are a great exercise for working the lower back, hip, and butt muscles. These muscles are part of the posterior chain, a group of muscles at the back of the body that supports the body weight and helps you to maintain proper posture. Good posture and equal distribution of weight lessens the pressure on the bones of the lower back and helps to relieve sciatica. To do a hip thrust:


Sit down on the floor with a bench or couch behind you. Rest your arms and upper back against the bench or couch. Position your feet hip-width apart with the knees bent (this position engages the hip and butt muscles later on in the exercise).
Thrust your hips up until your torso and thighs are parallel to the floor. The knees should be bent while the feet remain in contact with the ground. Don’t forget to breathe in and out during the movement.
Slowly lower your butt back towards the floor. This counts as one repetition. Do 3 sets of 15 reps daily with 1-minute rests in between.
No pain, numbness, or tingling sensations should be felt during this exercise. If you do experience any of these symptoms, stop the exercise immediately and consult your physician.

, The cat and camel is an excellent core workout that promotes both strength and flexibility. However, it is an advanced type exercise and should only be included as part of your exercise routine after you have developed a strong core using the three exercises outlined above.


Get down on all fours on a soft surface. The hands should be placed directly beneath the shoulders, while the knees should be under the hips.
Do the camel part of the exercise: suck in your abs and round your back up towards the ceiling as far as you can. The shape of your back should resemble a camel’s hump. This position stretches every fiber of your front and side core muscles, along with your upper and middle back. Hold this position for 5 seconds, then return to the starting position.
Next do the cat part of the exercise: Arch your back by pressing your stomach towards the floor and lifting your butt towards the ceiling. This strengthens the lower back muscles. Hold the position for 5 seconds.
Alternate between the cat and camel posture for 5 times each. That counts as 1 set. Do 3 sets with 2 minutes rest in between.
Avoid doing this exercise if you experience any slipped disc symptoms and see a doctor for proper guidance.

, People suffering from sciatica should stretch daily. Stretching helps to loosen the muscles compressing the sciatic nerve, thus alleviating pain. Stretching several times a day will not only improve existing symptoms, it will also help to prevent the condition from worsening.

, This is an easy exercise that will help to improve the flexibility of your lower back, relieving pressure on the sciatic nerve. To do this knee to chest stretch:


Lie flat on your back on the floor or an exercise mat. Place a flat cushion under your head.
Place your feet flat on the floor and bend your knees. Grasp your right knee with both hands and slowly bring it towards your chest. You should feel your lower back stretching.
Hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds, then return to the starting position. Repeat the exercise with your right leg, then do 3 to 5 repetitions on each leg.

, This specific exercise will move the sciatic nerve and hamstring, helping it to find a more comfortable position.


Lie on your back on an exercise mat and place a small flat cushion under your head. Keep your knees bent and your chin partially tucked in.
Grab one knee with both hands and bring it closer to your chest. Grab your hamstring with both hands, then try to straighten your leg. Continue to pull your knee towards your chest as you attempt to straighten the leg.
Hold this position for 20-30 seconds while taking deep breaths. Bend the knee and slowly return to the starting position. Repeat with the opposite leg, then continue for 3 to 5 repetitions of each leg., This exercise will move and stretch the spine backwards. This exercise is particularly beneficial for patients who suffer from secondary sciatic symptoms and disc herniation .


Lie on your stomach, then use your elbows to prop up your head and torso. Keep your neck and back long.
Keeping your neck straight and your hips on the ground, arch your back as high as comfort permits. You should feel a stretch in your lower back and stomach muscles.
Hold this position for 10 seconds while practicing deep breathing. Return to the starting position, then repeat this exercise 10-15 times.

, This exercise helps to stretch and strengthen the hamstring muscles.


Stand up straight in front of an elevated surface (approximately knee height), such as a stool or chair.
Lift one leg and rest your heel on top of the elevated surface. Keep your knee and leg as straight as possible while your toes point upward.
Lean forward, placing your hands on your knee for support. Try to keep your back straight as you do this. Hold this position for 20-30 seconds, while taking deep breaths.
Repeat the exercise on the opposite leg, then continue for 3 to 5 repetitions on each leg.

, This exercise helps to keep your butt muscles flexible, which allows your to perform a wider range of movement.


Start by lying on your back, with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Place a small cushion under your head for support.
Raise your left foot and place it over your right thigh. Link your hands at the back of your right thigh and pull the leg towards your chest.
Keep your tailbone and hips on the floor throughout the exercise. You should be able to feel a stretch in your right buttock.
Hold the stretch for 20-30 seconds while practicing deep breathing. Bring the foot back to the starting position then repeat the exercise with the other leg. Do 3 to 5 repetitions on each leg.

, The iliotibial band (ITB) is a type of connective tissue that spans the hip, butt, and outer leg muscles. If your ITB is not flexible, it will limit your movement and cause the muscles to compress the sciatic nerve. This aggravates the symptoms of sciatica. To do an ITB stretch:


Stand tall and cross your left foot over your right foot. Without bending the knees, bend at the hips by pushing your butt back and out, as you were closing a door with your backside.
Try to maintain the natural arch of the back at all times. There should be no slouching or rounding of the back. Rounding the back puts the spine out of its proper alignment.
The feet should be in contact with the ground at all times.Lifting the toes off the ground shifts the weight of the body backwards. This compresses the back and may cause aggravation of sciatica.
Push the hips out as far as they can go without experiencing any pain. Don't worry if you can't go more than a couple of inches — it is normal to have very limited ITB flexibility. Hold the position for 30 seconds to a minute.

, The best cardiovascular exercise for sciatica sufferers is swimming. Swimming places minimal stress on the back and the legs while still providing an effective cardio workout, that gets the heart rate up and burns calories. This gives you the all the advantages of a cardio workout without compromising on comfort. For best results, try to swim for 30 minutes a day, five times per week., Pilates is a great, low-impact way to improve the strength of your muscles without causing too much sciatic pain. Most Pilates maneuvers involve stretching the muscles using slow, smooth movements. For more information on how to do Pilates, see this article.

, Yoga is another great, low-impact form of exercise that helps to alleviate pain on the back and prevent it from recurring. Yoga is a combination of stretching and breathing techniques – making it the perfect activity for relieving sciatic pain. For more information on how to do yoga, see this article., Although it has numerous general health benefits, running is not a recommended form of cardio exercise for people suffering from sciatica. Running is stressful and jars the lower back and legs, which may cause sciatic pain to become worse.


However, going for a walk is recommended for people with sciatica, provided stretching is done before and after the walk and correct posture is maintained throughout the exercise.

, There are several different root causes of sciatic pain, however they all involve irritation of the sciatic nerve, either through compression, kinking or physical trauma. Some of the most common causes include:



A lumbar herniated disc: This happens when a disc in the spinal column “spills” out from its original place. This herniated disc comes in contact with the sciatic nerve, compressing it and causing pain and irritation.
'Degenerative disc disease: This condition is usually associated with aging. As the spinal disc ages, it weakens and may partially collapse leading to compression of the sciatic nerve.

Piriformis syndrome: This is when the piriformis muscle (located in the buttocks) compresses the sciatic nerve.

Lumbar spinal stenosis: This occurs when the spinal canal narrows in size, pushing its content outward and causing a kink in the sciatic nerve.
'Abnormalities in the spine: Anything abnormal in the structure of the lumbar spine will lead to sciatica. This may include infection, injury, tumor, internal bleeding, bone fracture or muscle weakness., The primary symptom of sciatica is pain. The pain may be felt along the length of the sciatic nerve, which runs through the lower back, buttocks, hips and legs. Because of the sciatic pain, the patient may have difficulty of moving, bending and walking., An accurate diagnosis of sciatica is important, as this will help the doctor to determine how the condition should be managed. The process for diagnosing sciatica will usually involve the follow:



A physical examination: A physical examination will be performed, involving the straight-leg-raise test. The doctor will ask you to lie down and raise your leg slowly. The doctor will note the point at which pain is felt to determine which part of the sciatic nerve is affected.

X-ray: An x-ray may be ordered to rule out fracture of the spine.

MRI and CT scans: These are the most helpful diagnostic tools in diagnosing sciatica. Detailed images of the lower back are created to learn more about the problem.

Additional tests: Other nerve tests may be performed to confirm the diagnosis.These may include: velocity studies, electromyography, myelogram and evoked potential testing."

, There are 3 stages of injury: acute, sub-acute and chronic stages. The sub-acute phase usually begins 2 to 4 weeks after injury.


During the acute stage you should avoid bending, lifting, stooping and prolonged sitting. Most doctors recommend a treatment of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pills and ice for the first few days after a back injury. After the first few days, try to avoid bed rest and return to a more normal activity level. Walking and gentle stretching can help to increase circulation and improve healing.

, The first session will be dedicated to strength, balance and pain level tests. Your therapist should design a program based on your strengths and weaknesses.

, Physical therapists are starting to use global postural re-education (GPR) to assist patients in developing proper posture. PT techniques will include assisted stretching, range of motion exercises and muscle strengthening exercises.


Changing your posture requires diligence for weeks and months. Your physical therapist may prescribe daily stretches and exercise to retrain muscles.

, This includes walking, swimming or using an elliptical. These activities cause very little stress on your back, while toning and stretching muscles and increasing circulation.

, Your physical therapist may give you some methods to try, such as doing a 10-minute elliptical warm up before stretching or exercising. Increase the exercise in small increments to avoid further injury and pain. As your muscles get stronger, you should be able to be more active without increasing your pain.

, People often complain of ""sciatica"" or pain caused by the sciatic nerve through the hips, buttocks and legs. This, and other back problems, can be lessened dramatically by doing back and leg stretching once or twice daily.


Do hamstring stretches once or twice daily. Lay on your back with your knees up. Lift and gently pull 1 knee into your chest for 10 seconds. Repeat 3 times on each side. Follow this stretch with the straight leg stretch. While on your back with your knees bent, lift 1 leg so that it is nearly straight. Grab the back of your thigh and bring it toward you for 10 seconds. Try to keep your leg as straight as possible. Repeat with both legs 3 times.
Do piriformis stretches. The piriformis muscles extend from your lower back through your buttocks and hips. While on your back with your knees bent, raise your right leg and rotate it to the left. Place your right leg on your left thigh just above your right ankle. Grasp your left thigh and bring it toward you. Hold for 30 seconds. Repeat twice on each side.
Do the child's pose. This yoga stretch works on the back, leg and buttock muscles. Lay on your stomach. Place your hands underneath your shoulders and fold your body back so your knees touch the front of your torso. Reach your hands out in front of your head as far as you can. Hold this stretch for 1 to 5 minutes.
Do other stretches as recommended by your physical therapist. The evaluation should show which muscles are the tightest.

, These exercises should target your underlying core and postural muscles. When these muscles are strong, they support the spine and lower pain.


Lay on your back with your knees bent. Press your back into the floor. Hold for 10 seconds. Release and rest for 3 seconds. Repeat 10 to 20 times. Pelvic tilts help to strengthen back and stomach muscles.
Do swimming. Lay on your stomach with your legs and arms outstretched. Raise 1 arm, hold for 3 seconds and lower it slowly. Repeat on the opposite side. Repeat 10 times with your arms and 10 times with your legs. Once your muscles get used to arms and legs separately, do the exercise with opposite legs and arms.
Do shoulder squeezes. While standing or sitting, lower your shoulders and squeeze your shoulder blades together as much as possible. Hold for 3 seconds and slowly release. Repeat 10 times. Do this whenever your shoulders are feeling stiff or you have spare time.

, Buy a yoga mat, small weights and any other low-cost equipment you use at physical therapy. You can reduce your sessions with a physical therapist if you are committed to doing the physical therapy routine at home.

, These are usually done at the end of a physical therapy session. Your physical therapist may suggest ice to reduce swelling, moist heat for muscle spasms or ultrasound for increasing circulation.

, Success in physical therapy requires that you avoid sitting or standing too much. Focus on getting plenty of sleep and keeping your back straight at night.


Physical therapists suggest that you sleep on your back with your knees propped up with pillows or on your side with a body pillow between your legs.

Consult with a physician.,
Follow your doctor’s recommended taper schedule.,
Talk to your doctor about switching to diazepam.,
Divide your total daily dose into three mini doses.,
Decrease your dose every two weeks.,
Recognize that your tapering schedule is specific to you.",How to Withdraw from Alprazolam1," All cases of benzodiazepine withdrawal should be overseen by a doctor who is familiar with the process. He will monitor your safety and progress, making adjustments to your alprazolam withdrawal schedule as needed.


Tell your doctor about all medications and supplements you’re taking. Be sure to mention any medical conditions that you have. These can affect your tapering schedule.;
, Most of the worst-case withdrawal scenarios result from abruptly quitting alprazolam. Quitting cold turkey from any benzodiazepine is unsafe and is not recommended by benzodiazepine experts. It is possible to reduce your alprazolam withdrawal symptoms by taking smaller amounts of the drug in small increments over a long period of time, letting your body adjust to each taper. Then, you can incrementally taper down again. You will not drop off the drug completely until you are down to a minimal dosage.


Tapering schedules with vary with each individual, depending on length of use, dosage, and other factors., If you have been using Alprazolam for a long time (over six months or so), your doctor may switch you to a longer-acting benzodiazepine such as diazepam.Your doctor may also recommend this option if you are on a high dose of Alprazolam. Diazepam works the same way as Alprazolam, but it is longer acting. This means that it stays in your system longer, which may result in fewer withdrawal symptoms.


Another benefit of diazepam is that this drug is readily available in liquid form and smaller dose tablets. Both of these options aid in tapering. The switch from alprazolam to diazepam can be immediate or gradual.
If your doctor chooses to switch you to diazepam, she will adjust your initial dosage of diazepam to equal your current dosage of Alprazolam. Generally speaking, 10 milligrams of Diazepam equals one milligram of Alprazolam., Your doctor may recommend that you divide your total daily dose into a schedule that you take three times a day. This will, of course, depend on your dose and time of use of the benzodiazepine. For example, if you have used alprazolam for a long time, you may have a longer taper schedule or smaller reductions per week.


Your dose schedule may also be adjusted according to how you respond to the taper.

, If you are on diazepam, the doctor generally will recommend decreasing either 20% to 25% of your total dose every two weeks, or 20% to 25% every week first and second week. Then you will likely decrease your dose by 10% every week thereafter. Some doctors recommend tapering 10% every one to two weeks, until you are at a 20% dose. Then you might taper down 5% every two to four weeks.If you are taking diazepam as a replacement for alprazolam, your total dose should not decrease more than about 5 mg of diazepam per week. It should also go down to decreasing by one to two milligrams per week when you reach a small dose like 20 mg of diazepam., No one model fits everyone, just like no pair of shoes fits everyone. Your taper schedule will depend on different things such as how long you have been on Alprazolam and your dose, and your withdrawal symptoms.


If you have been on low, sporadic doses of Alprazolam, your doctor may not recommend tapering or may taper faster than someone who has been on a chronic, steady or high dose.
Generally, anyone who has been on a benzodiazepine for over eight weeks will require a taper schedule.

Talk to your pharmacist.,
Maintain your physical health while you taper.,
Avoid caffeine, tobacco and alcohol.,
Don’t take over-the-counter drugs without consulting a pharmacist.,
Keep a journal.,
Check in with your doctor periodically.,
Ask your doctor about other medications.,
Visit a mental health professional.,
Consider a 12-step rehab program.",How to Withdraw from Alprazolam2," One of your best friends while tapering is your pharmacist. Her knowledge is paramount in your tapering success. She will offer solutions such as: compounding your prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs to avoid and other insightful pharmacological issues.


If your doctor prescribed other drugs instead of alprazolam, the taper plan will take that into account as well.

, At times, your withdrawal symptoms may make it difficult for you to function normally. But it is important that you take care of yourself while you taper. This will help your body through the detox process. Although there are no studies directly indicating this, physical activity and health may benefit you and minimize withdrawal symptoms.


Drink plenty of fluids.
Eat plenty of healthy foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables. Stay away from processed and refined foods.
Get as much quality sleep as you can.
Get regular exercise.

, While you are tapering, limit your caffeine intake as well as tobacco and alcohol use. Alcohol, for example, creates toxins in your body that can hinder the recovery process., Avoid using any over-the-counter (OTC) drugs without talking to a pharmacist or doctor first. Many OTC drugs can add stress to your central nervous system as you taper. These include antihistamines and sleep aids.

, Tapering schedules are based on how long you have been taking the alprazolam, and at what dosage. Track your dosage reductions by keeping an eye on when you take your dosage and how much the dosage is. You can keep track of when you have had good or bad days and adjust your taper accordingly. Keep in mind that you will make minor tweaks and adjustments as you move forward.


A journal entry example in a spreadsheet form might look like this:

1) January 1, 2015
2) 12:00 PM
3) Current dose: 2 mgs
4) Dose reduction: .02 mgs
5) Total reduction level: 1.88 mgs


You may add several daily entries for a multiple daily dosages.
Include any withdrawal symptoms or change of mood you notice.

, During your tapering process, you should be seeing your doctor every one to four weeks, depending on your taper schedule.Bring up any concerns and difficulties you are still experiencing.


Mention any withdrawal symptoms you may be experiencing, such as anxiety, irritability, agitation, insomnia, panic or headaches.
If you experience any severe symptoms like hallucinations or seizures, seek medical attention immediately.

, If you do experience severe withdrawal symptoms, a doctor may prescribe other drugs to help offset these symptoms. A doctor may also suggest an antiepileptic (anti-seizure) medication, such as carbamazepine (Tegretol). The risk of epileptic seizures increases greatly during withdrawal from alprazolam.


If you have a slowly designed taper plan, this is not a typical course of action that needs to be taken.

, Paying attention to your mental health is important after withdrawal from benzodiazepines, as it can take weeks, months or even years to fully reverse the neurological changes they cause. The acute process may take up to three months, but full recovery may take a couple years. It’s a good idea to visit a psychologist and/or a psychiatrist during this period.Consider continuing to see a mental health professional after your tapering schedule.

, If you have been taking high dosages of alprazolam, you may want to consider enrolling in a 12-step rehab program. The tapering schedule is separate from a rehab program, but if you are experiencing addition, a rehab program can be very helpful."

Understand why unsupervised withdrawal from Alprazolam is dangerous.,
Learn the symptoms of withdrawal.,
Be mindful of severe withdrawal symptoms.,
Recognize how long withdrawal symptoms can last.,
Be patient with your recovery.",How to Withdraw from Alprazolam3," Alprazolam, also known as Xanax (its brand name), is a medication known as a benzodiazepine. This medication is used to treat anxiety disorders, panic attacks and other related psychiatric disorders. Alprazolam and other benzodiazepines increase the action of a neurotransmitter, or chemical messenger in the brain, called GABA. The long-term use of alprazolam may cause dependence or addiction. If you abruptly discontinue using it, you may experience to severe withdrawal symptoms as your brain chemistry tries to rebalance itself. Stopping benzodiazepines like Alprazolam has the potential to cause a life-threatening withdrawal syndrome.


In some cases, unsupervised withdrawal from alprazolam may result in death.

, Familiarize yourself with the symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal before you start tapering alprazolam. This can help ease any mental anguish caused by not knowing what to expect and/or being taken by surprise by your withdrawal. Tapering off (slowly reducing your dose) under a doctor's care will reduce withdrawal symptoms. When you withdraw from alprazolam, you may experience any combination of symptoms and in varying severities. These symptoms may include:


Anxiety
Irritability
Agitation
Insomnia
Panic
Depression
Headache
Nausea
Fatigue
Blurred vision
Aches and pains

, Severe alprazolam withdrawal symptoms include hallucinations, delirium and seizures. If you experience any of these symptoms, seek medical attention immediately.

, Alprazolam withdrawal symptoms begin approximately six hours after taking the last dosage. The symptoms typically peak anywhere between 24 and 72 hours. They can last two to four weeks.Remember, until you have completed a successful benzodiazepine taper, your body will be in a constant mild withdrawal state. This is why a slow taper is highly recommended.

, Generally speaking, tapering off Alprazolam should be as slow as you feel comfortable with. If you taper more slowly, your symptoms should be less severe. Keep in mind that a slower taper results in far fewer withdrawal symptoms. The goal is to complete the tapering without prolonged withdrawal side effects, not to finish as quickly as possible to only suffer side effects and less repaired GABA receptors that will influence the healing process. The longer you are on a sedative-hypnotic like alprazolam, the longer it will take for your brain to return to normal once you stop.


The estimated time frame for tapering is between six and 18 months and varies upon dose rates, age, general health, stress factors and time of use. Regardless of your doctor-recommended taper schedule, it should be:Slow and gradual.
Scheduled: The doctor will ask you to take a dose at a certain time rather than “as needed.”
Adjusted to your symptoms of withdrawal or rebound of anxiety or disease.
Monitored weekly to monthly, depending on your situation.

If you do not wait long enough before taking buprenorphine, you will go into precipitated withdrawal.

The term ""Precipitated Withdrawal"" is used to describe a Super Withdrawal Syndrome which is the result of an antagonist (naloxone) or partial antagonist (buprenorphine) being introduced into an opioid tolerant individual. Precipitated withdrawal is related to the immediate delivery of a buprenorphine dose rather than the cumulative effect of the dose.
Precipitated withdrawal can be, under certain circumstances, a thousand times worse than normal opiate withdrawal so you must make sure you don’t introduce Subutex or Suboxone too early. There are time guidelines, but these can be misleading as everyone’s different. Some people, for example, feel methadone withdrawals 24hrs after their last dose, but some people don’t feel any withdrawal symptoms for days. Play it safe and make sure you're not too early.
It's always best to play safe and wait at least 18 to 24 hrs after short acting drugs like heroin.
If you are on a methadone program you must be down to at least 30 milliliters (1  fl oz) of Methadone daily and you must be off methadone at least 48hrs before starting subutex or suboxone treatment or you may go into precipitated withdrawal.
Precipitated withdrawal has a higher risk of happening if you are coming off Methadone, Fentanyl Transdermal Systems, or another long acting opioid.
If you have a predisposition to panic then the almost immediate onset of precipitated withdrawal can throw you into a panic attack.;
, These drugs work best as part of a comprehensive program. For best results, seek research-based counseling or behavioral therapies from medical professionals at the same time.The drug itself should be prescribed by a professional who has received training in how to supervise its use.

Buprenorphine typically begins with the ""induction phase."" Your first doses will be administered by a doctor or other trained professional, while your reaction is monitored.Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) centers are a great resource for prescriptions, support, and monitoring while you receive your treatment. They are increasingly common across the United States.

, If you are prescribed a film you place it under your tongue or between your gum and cheek and let it dissolve. Wet the area first with your tongue. Again, remember: If you take buprenorphine while physically addicted to an opiate you will go into precipitated withdrawal. You should:Not grind the tablets or cut, tear or chew the film
Not swallow the medication
Not place multiple films on top of each other
Not take them in any other way
Not eat or drink anything until they have dissolved

, This way there is less chance of precipitated withdrawal happening.


Do not take more than prescribed.
Do not double your dosage if you miss one.
If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If it is almost time for your next dose, then just skip the dose you missed.
The dosage will be set by a doctor according to the condition that you are being treated for and the strength of the medication. Adults are frequently prescribed one of the following:12 to 16 mg of Subutex (buprenorphine) to be taken daily.
Daily dosages of Suboxone which amount to 4 to 24 mg of buprenorphine and 1 to 6 mg of naloxone.



, Suboxone maintenance is all about getting your life in order and breaking free from old behaviours and negative patterns. Simply take the Suboxone the way you've supposed to, under your tongue, then forget about it.


Add new things into your life like N.A or groups where you are mixing with new people who are in the same boat as yourself. When you successfully detox, things will automatically fall into place for you. If you're well motivated and do the right things, there is every chance you can change your life for the better.
While it's beneficial to chat about your Suboxone treatment and get other people's views and experiences on it, it's not a good idea to constantly visit websites where the main topic of conversation is scare talk about the terrible withdrawals from Subutex or Suboxone. If you keep doing this you may get caught up in a vicious circle and be terrified of ever coming off the drug. You may be clean and free from your drug of choice, but you will become stuck in a rut and still have the negative thinking you had when you were previously addicted to drugs.

, Prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, herbal remedies, dietary supplements, and vitamins can all interact with medications. Do not drink grapefruit juice while on these medications unless your doctor says you can. Talk to your doctor before taking any new medications or supplements, particularly:Antihistamines, allergy, or cold medications.
Sedatives, tranquilizers, or medications to help you sleep.
Prescription medications for pain.
Narcotics.
Seizure medications.
Barbiturates.
Muscle relaxants.
Anesthesia. Tell your doctor or dentist that you are taking this medication before undergoing any form of surgery.

, The first goal of Subutex or Suboxone treatment is to eliminate your cravings, stop or greatly reduce your use of the problem drug, and reach the point where you experience few to no side effects. Once you are at this stage, talk to your care providers about the possibility of adjusting your dose. In this ""stabilization phase,"" some patients can lower the dose or switch to a dose every other day., There is no one-size-fits-all plan for Subutex treatment. Your medical care providers should create a personalized schedule for you. Once you are doing well on a steady dose of the drug, you have reached the ""maintenance stage"" of treatment. At this point you and your doctors can discuss staying on the drug indefinitely, or weaning yourself off the drug under medical supervision., The withdrawals from Subutex and Suboxone are severe because of the long half-life of the drug and the withdrawal syndrome is long and drawn out. No matter what way you withdraw, you are going to suffer from withdrawal symptoms but it can be made much more tolerable if you do it very slowly with very small dose reductions at the end.


When weaning off it's important you only drop a dose every 10 to 14 days because of the long half-life of the drug. Both Subutex and Suboxone have a 36 hour mean half-life which means half the drug will be out your system in 36 hours but this does not mean the other half will be gone 36 hours after this. It means after another 36 hours half the remainder will be gone and after a further 36 hours half of this remainder will be gone and so on. If you taper a dose every 3 or 4 days you will be in constant withdrawal and this is not the road to go down as you will end up very unwell and bedridden.
When you drop from a high dose to a slightly lower (but still reasonably high) dose, you won't feel too much at all where withdrawal is concerned. It's when you get down to the lower doses that withdrawal is much worse, especially when you are going from something to nothing. Many people make the mistake of jumping off from high doses, like 2mg, not realizing this is 10 times the therapeutic dose of Buprenorphine and the weaning process from such a high dose is extremely hard to take. When tapering off it's essential that you think in micrograms and half micrograms when you taper down from the 2mg or 3mg mark. Doing it this way makes it much easier to tolerate compared to coming clean off higher doses.
If you withdraw too quickly you will experience unpleasant symptoms which include stomach cramps and diarrhea, hot and cold flashes, restless leg syndrome and kicking (kicking the habit). You may also have insomnia, unpleasant vivid dreams, depression, aggression, fear and anxiety and your sense of smell may be heightened.

, The abstinence reactions from Subutex and Suboxone are not as severe as Methadone withdrawal but they last just as long and symptoms are at their most acute around the 4th and 5th day after stopping. During late withdrawal your symptoms may go away only to return the next day but eventually they will burn out and go away for good.

, It's pretty common after any detox, especially Suboxone, to suffer from Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome (PAWS) where you feel down and depressed for a few months while your body recovers and gets back to normal. You will recover as time goes on.


It's common to have fear you are never going to be normal again but you will get back to normal over time.

, When you're addicted to drugs your mindset is ingrained with drug seeking thoughts and habits and at all costs. It's necessary you change the way you think and behave to give yourself a real chance of living the decent life you deserve. Never let your guard down for one minute and always remember just because the monkey is off your back doesn’t mean the circus has left town.

, It's never a good idea to frequent the old haunts and houses where you used to abuse drugs...if you sit in the barber's long enough you'll end up getting a haircut. It's when you start to indulge in your old way of life that negative patterns can re-emerge and this is when learned helplessness and self-fulfilling prophecy can rear its ugly head and put you at risk.

,, The symptoms of an overdose include:A slow breathing rate
Blurry vision
Pinpoint pupils
Sleepiness
Dizziness

, Children and older adults sometimes require extra caution when taking medications. These medications have not been adequately studied in children to determine whether it is safe and effective for them. If you are a minor or responsible for a minor who will take these medications, discuss it with your doctor.
It may be necessary for the doctor to modify your dosage if you are older, particularly if you have kidney or liver problems.

, Even if you think you might be pregnant, but are not sure, discuss this with your doctor before taking this medication. This is extremely important for the health of your child.Scientific studies have not documented that this medication is safe for pregnant women. If you are pregnant, ask your doctor if there are safer alternatives. If you take this medication while pregnant, your baby may go through withdrawal after birth.
This medication is not safe for women who are breastfeeding and may negatively impact the infant. If you are breastfeeding, the doctor will likely suggest you take a different medication or discontinue breastfeeding.

, It is particularly important for your doctor to know if you have any of the following conditions:Breathing problems
A heart condition
A history of alcohol abuse
Stomach, liver, kidney, or gallbladder problems
A brain tumor or head injury
Problems with your adrenal gland or thyroid

Take multivitamins regularly.,
Treat colds with andrographis.,
Try Echinacea.,
Use asian ginseng.",How to Use Herbs to Heal2," Multivitamins contain a range of micronutrients that may be helpful. Immune response can be compromised by deficiencies of zinc, selenium, iron, copper, folic acid, and vitamins A, B6, C, and E.Most adults who consume a balanced diet already consume all the vitamins and trace minerals they needs; however, if you cannot bring yourself to eat vegetables or whole grains, you might benefit from a multivitamin..


There are multivitamins targeted at the needs of men, women, children, pregnant women, and the elderly. Speak to a doctor to determine what combination of vitamins may benefit you.There are adverse effects associated with multivitamins, and their use may be unnecessary and even dangerous.
Your doctor may instead recommend a single targeted vitamin supplement, such as vitamin D or B-12.Changes to your diet may be more beneficial than taking a multivitamin., Purchase extract of andrographis, an herb used in traditional medicines.Andrographis boosts your immune system, and its anti-inflammatory qualities make it especially helpful in combating colds.

Make herbal tinctures.,
Brew a tea.,
Mix an essential oil with a carrier oil for topical treatments.,
Grow your own medicinal herbs.,
Cook with herbs.,
Buy standardized supplements.",How to Use Herbs to Heal3," A tincture is a liquid concentration of a medicinal herb. It works like vanilla extract, drawing out and preserving the qualities of dry plant matter. To make a tincture, get a clean glass jar, vodka or apple cider vinegar, and the dried herb you wish to extract. Fill the jar half full of the dried herb. Pour a few teaspoons of boiling water on the herbs to open them up.Fill the rest of the jar with apple cider vinegar or vodka, and stir.
If using vodka, store in a cool and dry place for anywhere from three weeks to six months. Shake daily. Strain through a cheesecloth and store the tincture in dropper bottles.If using apple cider, store in the fridge. Discard after 6 months, or sooner if it starts to smell or mold., The healing qualities of herbs such as peppermint leaf, lemon balm, burdock root, ginger, and aloe vera can be extracted by boiling. Boil a cup of water on the stove. Add 2 to 4 teaspoons of your herb of choice and steep for 5 to 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and let it cool, then strain out the plant matter. Drink the tea, or apply to your skin throughout your day.Make sure the herb you want is safe and effective when boiled. Some herbs, such as tea tree oil, can be harmful if drunk as a tea., Purchase an essential oil, or make a tincture. Pick a neutral oil, such as coconut or vegetable oil. Mix 3-6 drops of essential oil into an ounce of carrier oil. Use your fingers or a swab to apply your medicine to your skin.Make sure you use a swab to apply medicine to viral skin conditions, such as cold sores, so that you don't spread them further on your skin.

, Many medicinal herbs, such as parsley, lemon balm, Echinacea, and peppermint, area easy to grow. Do a little research into what the climate and microclimate of your house can support: drier earth might take well to lavender, lemon balm, hyssop, and thyme, while wetter spots can support angelica, self-heal, peppermint, and skullcap. Herbs such as black cohosh and bloodroot can grow in the shade. Though herbs will grow best in soil enriched with compost and mulch, they can often struggle through poorer quality soils than other plants., Herbs, roots, and vegetables will account for most of the micronutrients you need. Whole grains and meat account for the rest. Cook a traditional chicken soup for its anti-inflammatory qualities: use chicken, ginger, garlic, onion, carrots, celery and parsley., Your safest bet is to purchase prepared herbal medicine. Doses can vary widely depending on the growing conditions and preparation of an herb, and though not all companies are reliable, they are at least experienced.You can buy herbal medicine at health food stores, at some supermarkets, online, or from herbalists.
Herbal medicines don't always look like medicine. Though many herbs are sold in pill form, you might find useful supplements in an oil, a lip balm, a cream, or a tea.
Get a prescription from an herbalist, a doctor who practices Traditional Chinese Medicine, or even a regular doctor or pharmacist to determine appropriate doses.

Take proper precautions before applying tretinoin to your skin.,
Apply tretinoin to the affected area as directed.",How to Use Tretinoin and Benzoyl Peroxide Concurrently," While it's perfectly safe to use tretinoin and benzoyl peroxide concurrently, some dermatologists worry that it may cause some skin irritation. This is because benzoyl peroxide products typically contain a peeling agent.However, studies have shown that the two medications are safe to use together if precautions are taken to reduce the chances of irritation.Alternate which product you apply to your skin every day for the first two weeks. For example, if you use tretinoin on Monday, wait until Tuesday to use benzoyl peroxide.
Continue alternating products until two weeks have passed to minimize the risk of irritation. After that point, your doctor may advise you that it's safe to use both products at the same time.;
, After the first two weeks, your body should be a bit more used to both medications. At this point, you may want to consider switching to using both products together at the same time each day. Talk to your dermatologist before making any changes to your prescription medication regimen and ask about any possible risks or side effects.Some studies have shown that applying tretinoin and benzoyl peroxide together at the same time each day may actually have a lower risk of adverse side effects than when they're used at different times.

, Tretinoin is known to cause photosensitivity, which means you'll have to protect your skin from sunlight while using this product on your skin. However, exposure to wind and cold weather may also irritate your skin on the affected area.Wear sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher any time you will be in the sun. Even though you apply the medication at night, your skin may still be susceptible to sun damage during the day.
Wear protective clothing to block your skin from the sun and strong wind. A wide-brimmed hat works best for protection in the sun, while a scarf might help cover your face from the wind during cold weather.
Be aware that the risk of weather-related skin damage is highest during the first six months you use tretinoin. Take precautions whenever you're outside in any type of weather.

, Tretinoin has been known to cause skin irritation, including (but not limited to) warm/stinging sensations, redness, and scaling or crusting.Similarly, benzoyl peroxide has been known to cause dryness and peeling of the skin.You can minimize the side effects of both medications by keeping your skin well moisturized throughout the day.Only use bland facial washes and moisturizers while using these medications. Choose products that are either free of alcohol or have a very low alcohol content., Most side effects of these medications are minimal, and will eventually go away on their own with continued use. However, some reactions can be signs of a larger problem, such as a possible overdose of the medication. Seek emergency care right away if you experience burning, itching, swelling, or severe redness or scaling of the skin., Many over-the-counter products containing benzoyl peroxide are available without a prescription. However, some prescription-strength acne medications contain benzoyl peroxide as well.The medicine you use will depend on the severity of your acne, and only a doctor or dermatologist is qualified to advise on the best treatment for your skin.


Benzoyl peroxide comes in many forms, including liquid soap, bar soap, lotion, cream, and even foam.
Common brand names containing benzoyl peroxide available in the U.S. include Acne, Acne 10 Gel, Acne Wash, Benzac, Benzagel, Benziq, and Brevoxyl.

, Benzoyl peroxide may irritate the skin. If you're using an over-the-counter product for the first time, it's best to test a small amount on one or two isolated areas of your skin for several days to determine whether you'll have a negative reaction. Even if you don't have a negative reaction, it's best to proceed with some degree of caution.Never use benzoyl peroxide on skin that is windburned, sunburned, cracked, or cut unless your doctor tells you it is safe to do so.

, If you're using a cream, gel, or lotion form of benzoyl peroxide, you'll want to follow the instructions closely. Make sure your skin is clean before using this product, and only use as much as the instructions indicate.Use a non-medicated soap and clean, lukewarm water to wash the affected area before using benzoyl peroxide. When you're finished, gently pat your skin dry with a clean, soft towel.
Apply only enough cream/lotion/gel to cover the affected area(s), or however much your doctor recommended in his or her instructions.

, If you're using a benzoyl peroxide product that comes in a soap or cleansing lotion/bar form, you won't need to wash your face before applying it. Simply follow the directions on the package and only use as much of the product as the instructions or your doctor recommended., Tretinoin gel is only available by prescription, and it treats acne by keeping the pores in your skin open and clear.However, if your doctor prescribes you tretinoin (or any other retinoid product), you should let him or her know about any benzoyl peroxide products you currently use, including over-the-counter products.


Common brand-name tretinoin products available in the U.S. include Atralin, Avita, Refissa, Renova, Retin-A, and Tretin-X.
Do not use tretinoin if you are pregnant or may become pregnant, as it is known to cause serious birth defects.Doctors generally recommend that women use two forms of birth control during the entire treatment period and for one month after finishing the final dose of this medication.

, Topical tretinoin often causes skin irritation, especially within the first few weeks of use. However, if your skin irritation becomes severe or if your acne shows no signs of improvement after 8 to 12 weeks of continued use, talk to your doctor about possible complications.Avoid washing the affected area or applying any other topical medications to that area for one hour before using tretinoin and for one hour after use.Do not use any skin products that are abrasive or dry out your skin, including skin cleansers and products containing alcohol. Tretinoin has been known to irritate the skin, and these products may increase the risk of irritation.

, It's very important that you follow the instructions your doctor gave you when using tretinoin gel. Do not apply more tretinoin gel in a given dose than your doctor recommends, and do not use this medication more than once in a given day. If you miss a dose, skip that dose completely and wait for the next scheduled application time.Wash the affected area with a mild, non-abrasive and non-prescription soap at least one hour before applying tretinoin gel.
Wash your hands with a mild soap before applying tretinoin to the affected area.
Use either your clean fingertips, a clean piece of gauze, or a clean cotton swab to apply tretinoin to the affected area.
You will not need much of this medication to see results. Some experts recommend using only a pea-sized drop, or whatever instructions your doctor specifically gives you.Only apply tretinoin at night. Tretinoin is known to cause photosensitivity, so it's best to use this medication shortly before bedtime."

Know how Retin-A works.,
Consult a doctor.,
Learn about the different types of Retin-A.,
Be informed about potential side effects.,
Know the contraindications.",How to Use Retin A1," The product has proved to be beneficial for several skin disorders, particularly acne.Retin-A helps to unclogs pores and reduce skin peeling. It can also be useful in reduce the appearance of wrinkles and skin damage due to sun exposure; however, Retin-A cannot cure acne, reverse wrinkles or repair sun damage.Retin-A has long been recognized as beneficial for the treatment of mild to moderate acne, including blackheads, whiteheads, cysts and lesions in teenagers and adults.In addition, the appearance of wrinkles are greatly diminished (though they do not disappear) with extended use and increased strength of Retin-A. Darkened skin, also known as sun spots, will also lighten with continued use of Retin-A.Studies have further shown Retin-A improves the roughness of skin by smoothing or exfoliating the skin surface.;
, Retin-A (generic name: tretinoin) is a derivative of vitamin a and is a member of a group of medications called retinoids that impact the growth of skin cells. Retin-A works by changing the growth patterns and inter-cell attachments of skin cells. It inhibits the development of microcomedones, small plugs in the skin due to dead skin cells gathering inside the pore and clogging it. The development of microcomedones is typically recognized as a precursor to acne; thus, Retin-A works to prevent this from happening and can decrease the number and severity of pimples that do develop.The medication also facilitates quicker healing of acne pimples. In addition, Retin-A decreases the “stickiness” of skin cells in sebaceous follicles or oil glands.

, If you think Retin-A might be a good option for your skin problems, you should make an appointment with your primary health practitioner who can then recommend you to a dermatologist if needed. Dermatologists are physicians that specialize in the skin and in particular, skin disorders.


Primary care doctors can and often do prescribe Retin-A if its an uncomplicated case, so you may not need to see a dermatologist.
Your doctor will be able to choose to most appropriate treatment for you based on your symptoms and particular skin type. Be sure to notify your doctor of any other conditions and medical history, especially if you have or had other skin conditions, such as eczema., Retin-A comes in a topical liquid, gel, and cream formula. Gels are generally better for acne because they have less emollient properties; however, gels can dry the skin, so if you have dry skin, the cream form of Retin-A is likely the best option.Retin-A comes in different medicated strengths, The gel is available as 0.025% or 0.01%. The cream comes as 0.1%, 0.05%, or 0.025%. The liquid comes as 0.05%. Your doctor will generally prescribe a lower strength to begin with and increase strength or dosage as needed. This graduation is to prevent side effects., Mild side effects from using Retin-A are to expected; however, if any of the following side effects become severe, intolerable, or hinder your daily functioning, contact your doctor immediately. Note that most side effects occur during the first two to four weeks of use of Retin-A; in most cases, side effects decrease with continued use. The most common and scientifically documented side effects include:Skin dryness
Blisters and redness of skin
Itching, peeling, and scaling
A warming or burning sensation
Initial increase in acne

, Since this medication is absorbed through the skin, pregnant women should not use Retin-A because it has been proven to be very teratogenic (can cause birth defects).If you are using Retin-A to treat acne, do not use other acne products while using Retin-A because they may increase skin irritation.
Avoid using peeling products or products that contain peeling agents such as benzoyl peroxide, resorcinol, salicylic acid, or sulfur or other acids."

Wash your hands and the affected skin area(s).,
Apply the medication with your fingertips.,
Use Retin-A consistently.,
Avoid UV exposure.,
Use a moisturizer if your skin gets too dry.,
Contact your physician.",How to Use Retin A2," Generally, Retin-A is used daily at bedtime, or once every two to three days. For best results, use it at night.Make sure you confirm with your physician and the pharmacist as to the correct dosage as well as the appropriate method and frequency of use. Feel free to ask the doctor or pharmacist any questions you may have.

, Wash your hands and face thoroughly with mild soap and water. Try not to use abrasive soap or anything with ""microbeads"" or other exfoliants. Pat your skin dry.Make sure your skin is completely dry. Wait 20 – 30 minutes before applying Retin-A to ensure it is dry.

, You could also use a cotton swab or cotton pad, especially if you are using Retin-A in liquid form. Use about a pea-sized amount of Retin-A (whether it be the liquid, gel or cream) or enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. The coverage should be thin and sparing, rather than slathered on the skin. In general, you shouldn't need much more than a pea-sized amount if you're applying it to a specific area. Wash your hands after application.Apply the medication to the affected skin only. Do not apply to your entire face and/or neck.
Take caution when applying Retin-A. You don't want it to get into the areas around your mouth and directly under eyes.If you do get it in your eye flush with water. Use clean lukewarm water, and flush for 10 to 20 minutes. If irritation persists contact your doctor.Wash your hands thoroughly when you are done applying. This will help you avoid transferring residual Retin-A to other people, on other parts of your skin, or accidentally rubbing into your eyes or in your mouth, all of which can be harmful.

, It's important that you use Retin-A regularly in order to receive the most benefits from it. Try using it at the same time every evening. This will help make it part of your nightly routine. Retin-A won't work as a one time treatment when you have a pimple. Its action is a long-term remodeling of the skin.Note that your acne may worsen during the first seven to 10 days, but should improve in the first few weeks after continuous use. In some cases, it takes even eight to 12 weeks to notice improvement.Never double the dose or application. If you miss a dose and are using it everyday, skip the missed dose completely. Do not double the dose. Similarly, don't apply more Retin-A than the pea-sized amount or use it more than once a day. This will not improve your skin, but only increase the likelihood of experiencing side effects., Retin-A can make you more sensitive to the sun. Take care to avoid prolonged sun exposure as well as things like tanning booths and sunlamps. Use a sunscreen daily of at least SPF 30 to prevent sunburn or irritation during the day. Wear protective clothing, like a hat, long sleeves, and pants, when outdoors and in the sun.If you get a sunburn, wait until your skin has completely healed from the sunburn before using Retin-A., Consult your doctor about which moisturizers to use if your skin does become too dry due to using Retin-A. Generally water-based moisturizing creams, gels or lotions work best if you are using Retin-A for acne. If using Retin-A for wrinkles or sunspots, oil-based creams and lotion are fine to use.


Do not apply any creams or topical medications until one hour after using Retin-A., Note that most people do not experience serious side effects when using Retin-A; however, if you experience any of the following, you should get in touch with your doctor immediately:Blistering, crusting, burning or swelling of the skin
Dizziness, headache, confusion, anxiety or depression
Drowsiness, slow speech or facial paralysis
Allergic reaction, including hives, swelling, difficulty breathing
If you become pregnant while using Retin-A

, Women who are pregnant or nursing should be especially cautious about using herbal supplements, since these products can act like drugs. This caution also applies to treating children with herbal supplements.

, It is important to consult your health care provider before using an herbal supplement, especially if you are taking any medications (whether prescription or over-the-counter). Some herbal supplements are known to interact with medications in ways that cause health problems. Even if your provider does not know about a particular supplement, he can access the latest medical guidance on its uses, risks, and interactions.

, If you use herbal supplements, it is best to do so under the guidance of a medical professional who has been properly trained in herbal medicine. This is especially important for herbs that are part of a whole medical system, such as traditional Chinese medicine or Ayurvedic medicine.

, In the United States, for example, herbal and other dietary supplements are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as foods. This means that they do not have to meet the same standards as drugs and over-the-counter medications for proof of safety, effectiveness, and what the FDA calls Good Manufacturing Practices.

, The active ingredient(s) in many herbs and herbal supplements are not known. There may be dozens, even hundreds, of such compounds in an herbal supplement. Scientists are currently working to identify these ingredients and analyze products, using sophisticated technology. Identifying the active ingredients in herbs and understanding how herbs affect the body are important research areas for such government bodies as the US National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM).

, Published analyses of herbal supplements have found differences between what's listed on the label and what's in the bottle. This means that you may be taking less - or more - of the supplement than what the label indicates. Also, the word ""standardized"" on a product label is no guarantee of higher product quality; for instance, in the United States, there is no legal definition of ""standardized"" (or ""certified"" or ""verified"") for supplements. Some herbal supplements have been found to be contaminated with metals, unlabeled prescription drugs, microorganisms, or other substances.

, There has been an increase in the number of websites that sell and promote herbal supplements on the Internet. The US Federal Government has taken legal action against a number of company sites because they have been shown to contain incorrect statements and to be deceptive to consumers; this has also happened in other jurisdictions, such as Australia. It is important to know how to evaluate the claims that are made for supplements.

Know when a sleeping pill may be warranted.,
Talk to your doctor about sleep aid options.,
Follow all instructions carefully.,
Don't quit a sleeping pill ""cold turkey"" if you've been taking it regularly.,
Recognize possible side effects.,
Pick the right night to start.,
Use sleeping medications only as needed, but also as recommended.,
Try improving your sleep without medication.,
Consider “natural” sleep aids carefully.,
Try OTC sleeping pills.,
Move on to prescription sleep aids if necessary.",How to Use Sleeping Pills Safely," In most instances, sleeping pills are safest and most effective when used ""as needed"" due to specific circumstances. If, for instance, you have traveled across multiple time zones or are recovering from a painful medical procedure, using a sleep aid for a night or two may be worthwhile. Unless under the direct guidance of a physician, do not use sleeping pills on a nightly or even consistent basis.If you consistently have trouble falling or staying asleep at night, especially when there are no extenuating circumstances (a sick child, a big meeting the next day, etc.), you should contact your doctor for a checkup.
If you have a history of diagnosed sleep disorders, depression, or substance abuse, definitely contact your doctor before using a sleep aid. They can have a powerful impact on the body and can be quite addictive.;
, While you will be required to seek your physician’s recommendation in order to use a prescription sleep medication, it is good practice to consult her before using any type of sleep aid. At very least, you should consult your pharmacist about possible interactions between your chosen prescription, over-the-counter (OTC), or herbal remedy and other medications you take.Remember, sleep aids of any type are essentially a temporary “band-aid” that can mask a range of conditions that may be causing your sleeplessness, without doing anything to help these underlying issues. Such underlying conditions can range from depression to sleep apnea, and it is therefore wise to discuss your persistent sleeplessness with your doctor., Whether you’re dealing with sleeping pills, heart pills, cold pills, or any other kind of pill, it is essential that you fully understand and follow the dosing instructions provided by your doctor and/or the medication package. For your health and safety, you need to take the right dose at the right time, every time.Don't take a sleeping pill your friend hands you out of her purse because it works for her. You will not have the necessary information to determine if that pill is safe for you. Never take a prescription sleep aid that is not prescribed for you, or an OTC or herbal sleep aid that does not come from a legitimate, legal source or have the required packaging and informational literature.

, Certain sleep medications, if stopped abruptly after a period of regular use, can cause ""rebound insomnia."" This condition creates an even more severe sleeplessness than you’d experienced before taking the medication.Always ask your doctor before stopping a sleep aid you've been taking consistently. Likewise, don't increase or decrease your dosage without consulting your doctor or pharmacist first. You could increase your risk of dependency or harmful side effects such as depression.
Sleep aids taken only occasionally are not a significant issue in regards to ""rebound insomnia"" or other problems with starting and stopping; however, never ""double up"" on any sleep aid halfway through the night because you decide the first pill wasn't enough. Follow the dosing instructions precisely., Perhaps not surprisingly, persistent morning drowsiness can be a side effect of taking a sleeping medication, especially if you do not dedicate an adequate block of time for sleep. Beyond this, however, the side effects of sleeping pills can vary widely depending upon the particular medication, and can occasionally be severe or even life-threatening. Refer to the packaging and talk to your doctor or pharmacist so that you are prepared to recognize possible side effects.Prescription sleeping pills in the “sedative hypnotics” class (which includes the most common choices) can cause “complex sleep-related behaviors” — that is, sleep-walking, sleep-eating, sleep-driving, etc., with no recollection of doing so the next morning.
Some sleeping medications can also cause severe allergic reactions in some people, and sometimes increase depression or suicidal thoughts., There is no way to know how a particular sleeping pill will impact you until you actually start taking it. It may make no difference, knock you out for half the next day, or cause an allergic reaction that sends you to the ER; therefore, it is best not to start a new sleeping medication the night before a big exam, an important meeting, or any other time when being 100% alert and ready to go is essential.For instance, if you have a “lazy Sunday” coming up, Saturday night would be a good choice for starting a new sleeping medication. Make sure you can dedicate at least eight hours to sleeping that night, and don’t make any major plans for the next morning. Give the medication a chance to work (or not) in a low-pressure environment first.
If possible, play it safe and have someone check up on you the next morning by calling, texting, stopping by your house, etc.
Of course, if your doctor advises you to start a medication immediately, follow his advice.

, It may be a bit obvious to say that the safest sleeping pill is the one you don’t take, but it is simply true that only taking sleeping medications when you need to is normally the healthiest, best option. That said, use your doctor’s instructions as your primary guidance about when and for how long to take a sleeping medication.Several types of sleep aids — and especially many prescription medications — run the risk of becoming addictive, so it is preferable to take them for limited or defined periods of time (for instance, for two to four weeks straight or two to three times per week as needed).
If you need to take a sleep aid every night in order to get any decent sleep, it is important that you see your doctor to determine what is causing your sleeplessness.

, Some people have trouble sleeping at night due to a medical condition, and others for unknown reasons. Many of us, however, have sleepless nights because of poor preparation for sleep. Before resorting to a sleep aid, try making some simple lifestyle changes and adjustments to your nighttime routine and see if these improve your sleep patterns. Check out this wikiHow article for more tips on improving sleep, and try:Avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine for four to six hours before bedtime; avoiding exercise 2 hours before bedtime; avoiding large meals two hours before bedtime; taking any naps before 3:00 in the afternoon.
Choosing a dark, quiet, comfortable room; “winding down” for 30 minutes before bedtime by reading, listening to music, etc. (and not by watching TV or looking at your phone, computer or another type of screen device); getting up if you haven’t fallen asleep within 20 minutes of bedtime and doing another “wind-down” until you are sleepy.

, Some herbal or traditional sleep aids, like chamomile tea (two to three bags steeped for ten minutes, typically), have been used for ages and are almost always safe. Other herbal or similar supplements, however, even if marketed as “natural,” may be just as prone to dangerous side effects as over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription sleeping pills. They may also do nothing to actually help you sleep.Valerian is an herbal remedy that is generally safe and non-habit forming, but is of unclear usefulness in aiding sleep. Unlike most sleep aids, it works best when taken nightly for at least two weeks. Consult your doctor about possible interactions with statins and other medications.
Melatonin is a hormone naturally produced by the body at night. It is best to stick to low doses (usually 1-3 mg), and to take special care if you are on blood pressure or diabetes medications.
Tryptophan is an amino acid famous for being in your Thanksgiving turkey, its sleep-inducing effectiveness is inconclusive.
Kava is a traditional remedy that may help with stress-related insomnia, but can cause severe liver damage. It is best taken under a doctor’s supervision.
Whatever your herbal sleep aid choice, follow the dosing instructions carefully. If there are not clear instructions provided, don't take the medication. Your safest move is to contact your doctor before taking any sleep aid, herbal remedies included.

, There are more options than ever before in the sleep aid section of your local drugstore, which may improve your likelihood of finding a pill that works for you. Remember, though, that just because a medication is over-the-counter does not mean that it is safe to take for everyone. Possible drug interactions and side effects must be accounted for, and it is best to consult your doctor or pharmacist first.Despite the brand variety available, most OTC sleep aids are antihistamines, either diphenhydramine (such as Nytol) or doxylamine (such as Unisom). The sedating effects of antihistamine-based sleep aids can often bleed into the next day, causing a sort of “hangover” — especially if you do not give yourself eight or more hours to sleep.

, If other options have failed to help, your doctor may advise and prescribe one of several sleep medications, all of which require careful monitoring for possible side effects.Some options include:


Benzodiazepine sedative hypnotics. The oldest variety of prescription sleep aids, these are controlled substances with a high risk of dependency, as well as risks of dangerous allergic reactions and episodes of sleep-walking/eating/driving, etc.
Non-benzodiazepine sedative hypnotics. These include popular medications like Ambien, and work on the same area of the brain with less risk of dependency; however, there is less information regarding their long-term effects, and they carry the same risk of sleep-walking, etc., along with a possible risk of depression and/or suicidal thoughts. Sedative hypnotics may increase the risk of fetal malformations during pregnancy and should never be taken with alcohol.
Melatonin receptor agonists. These are a new variety of prescription sleep aids, and work primarily to help you fall — but not necessarily stay — asleep. They can cause dizziness, worsen depression, and exacerbate existing liver damage, among other possible side effects.
Antidepressants. While not intended for use as sleep aids, these are sometimes prescribed for “off label” use by physicians. Regardless of why they are being used, they carry the risk of worsening depression or suicidal thoughts.
Orexin receptor antagonists. These new drugs target orexins, which are chemicals that help keep you awake and alert. These medications block the orexin receptors in your brain, which will hopefully make you tired."

You can discuss drug interactions, side-effects, and dosage with a psychiatrist.


A mental health professional will guide you in considering your options and making an informed decision regarding medication.;
, Discuss all medications you are currently taking with your prescriber. This also includes any vitamins, herbs, and supplements. Communicate any allergies or adverse effects you’ve encountered with other medications.You may also include a family history of medication use if known.


Prepare your medication history before your appointment. Write down what medications you take and any interactions you’ve had with medications.

, For many, therapy and medication together is effective at treating severe depression. While medication can help manage symptoms of depression, therapy can help you approach life more productively. Therapy can help bring awareness to thoughts and behaviors and change them to be more adaptive.


For many individuals, therapy alone is the best course of treatment.Some studies have shown that cognitive therapy is as effective as medication., Follow your prescriber’s directions when taking medication. Your prescriber may indicate when to take medication (morning, afternoon or night), whether to include food, and how often to take your dose.


Some studies show that using a low dose of TCAs is beneficial in reducing symptoms and decreasing the risk of side-effects.Do not “double dose” or skip doses. Stick to a regular schedule of taking medication.

, Some people may notice effects within a few days. With TCAs, it’s common for people to experience effects after 2-4 weeks after the medication has had time to build up in the body. Even if the medication feels ineffective, it’s recommended to wait 3-4 weeks before switching to another medication or stopping completely.Do not increase your dose if you feel like the medication is not working. Stick with it, and if you are concerned, contact your provider.

, Higher doses of TCAs can cause serious health problems. Some medical doctors may periodically take blood tests to ensure the medications are not adversely affecting health.These tests measure the levels of TCAs in the bloodstream.

, Do not share medication with friends or family members, and do not sell medication. If you think someone you know may benefit from TCAs, refer them to a prescriber. Do not share your dose. Under no circumstances is it advised to share medications.Recognize the risks of sharing medication. For instance, the individual may have a drug allergy or experience very negative side-effects.

, If you are already on TCAs, let your doctor know about your plans around pregnancy. You may need to adjust your dose or stop taking medication altogether. Discuss your concerns with your doctor.

, Stopping medication abruptly or skipping doses can create withdrawal symptoms in the body. Symptoms may include nausea, sweating, flu-like symptoms, headache, dizziness, and muscle cramping. Before stopping, talk about ending your course of medication with your prescriber. He or she will help you taper your doses gradually to minimize withdrawal symptoms., TCAs can cause unpleasant side-effects. The most common side-effects include dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, urinary retention, drowsiness, increased appetite/weight gain, and sweating. More serious side-effects include disorientation or confusion, tremors, irregular heartbeat, low sex drive or difficulty with orgasm, and more frequent seizures in people who have seizures.Discuss the risks of TCAs carefully with your prescriber prior to beginning medication.

, Each person will respond differently to medication, so it’s important to be aware of any unpleasant side-effects you may encounter. You may try several medications to find one that suits you and is effective.Do not deviate from the prescribed dose, but use as directed.


Keep a journal of any changes you notice in your thoughts and behaviors, both good and bad.

, Monitor any side-effects of the medication, especially within the first few weeks. Notice any changes in thoughts, moods, or behaviors as related to medication use. Keep track of emerging or persistent symptoms and discuss them during regular visits with your prescriber., Let your prescriber know if you experience any negative side-effects. If you feel like the side-effects are not worth the benefits of the medication, communicate this to your prescriber. Your dosage may be adjusted or you may try a different medication.Any major impacts such as hallucinations, confusion, or major health upsets should be reported to your prescriber right away.

, The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States of America requires that all antidepressant medication receive a black box warning, the strictest warning for prescription drugs. Children, teenagers, and young adults can be at increased risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors while taking TCAs. Risk is highest in the first months of taking medications as well as around any changes in dosage.If you experience suicidal thoughts or behaviors seek help immediately. Go to the Emergency Department, call a hotline, or contact a friend to help you. Contact your therapist and psychiatrist immediately.

, While taking TCAs, you can run the risk of getting Serotonin Syndrome, which means the body is flooded with too much serotonin. Dangerously high serotonin levels lead to anxiety, agitation, confusion, tremors, restlessness, lack of coordination, and rapid heart rate. If you experience these symptoms, seek medical attention immediately.The most common reason for serotonin syndrome occurs when individuals mix TCAs with St. John’s Wort. If you take St. John’s Wort, talk to your prescriber about it during your appointment.
Take extra precaution if you have one of the following diagnoses: a heart condition, prostate enlargement, glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, epilepsy, liver problems, or bipolar disorder., TCAs can make the effects of alcohol stronger. It’s important to set limits while taking TCAs. Talk to your prescriber about healthy limits for alcohol consumption while taking TCAs., TCAs have the potential to be abused and misused.Use TCAs only as directed by your prescriber.


When taking TCAs, take only the prescribed dose. Do not increase or decrease your dose without notifying your prescriber.

, An overdose of TCAs can include seizures, altered mental state, hypotension and other symptoms. Some people have taken lethal doses of TCAs. If the person does not reach medical treatment, the chance of death is about 70%. In those that do reach medical treatment, chance of death decreases to 2-3%."

Anxiety.
Diabetes.
Diarrhea.
Glaucoma.
High blood pressure.
High cholesterol.
Irritable Bowel Syndrome.
Osteoporosis.;
, The Xenadrine manufacturers advise dieters to take this weight loss pill with a glass of water.This is an important component of taking this pill, and any other pill that you are required to swallow. Water lubricates the throat so that the pill passes safely into the stomach. It also aids in digestion.Water prevents ulcers and damage to the stomach lining.
If a pill is not swallowed with water, you risk getting it stuck in your throat and burning a hole through the esophagus. This can be fatal., To be most effective, Xenadrine should be swallowed with a glass of water about thirty minutes before a meal, either breakfast or lunch. In other words, Xenadrine should be taken on an empty stomach.The herbal elements in Xenadrine make it a diuretic.This means it prompts your body to flush out water more efficiently.Most diuretics are designed to make your kidneys put more sodium into your urine. This sodium pulls water from your blood as it exits the body, which makes you lose weight.

, Currently there are two different types of Xenadrine products on the market. For Xenadrine Core, take only one pill the first two days.For Xenadrine Ultimate, take one pill twice a day for the first three days.After the first two days of taking Xenadrine Core, you can increase your dosage to one pill two times per day (two pills per day). Do not take more than two of the Xenadrine Core pills in 24 hours.After the first three days of taking Xenadrine Ultimate, you can increase your dosage to two capsules two times per day (four pills per day)., Since a large component of both types of Xenadrine is caffeine, it is most effective if you don’t take it within 5 hours of your bedtime. To be safe, avoid taking Xenadrine before dinner. Instead, take Xenadrine just before eating breakfast and lunch., In order to see the best results, maintain your Xenadrine regimen for 60 days, or two months (about 8 weeks). It takes time for any new diet or exercise routine to affect your physical body, Xenadrine included.Stop taking Xenadrine after using it for 60 days.

It can also lead to chemical dependence.It takes about four to eight weeks to start seeing toned muscles after beginning an exercise program., A diet pill like Xenadrine will probably stimulate your metabolism enough to make you want to move more. But you should still be purposeful about weight loss. For best results, combine Xenadrine with a healthy diet and regular exercise routine.Find a healthy eating lifestyle that works for you.
Read about different diets and ask friends and your doctor for their advice.
Talk to your doctor or a physical trainer to find the best exercises.

, It is always important to find out what ingredients are present in something that you put in your body. You should find out of you have an allergy to anything, and you should know what each ingredient will do to your body.


In Xenadrine core, you will find the following ingredients:Green coffee bean extract
Caffeine anhydrous
L-Theanine
White kidney bean extract
Mangosteen pericarp powder
Coleus root extract
Perilla seed extract
Yohimbe bark extract
Caraway seed extract
Gotu kola whole herb extract


The capsule is made of gelatin and titanium dioxide, as well as mica, FD&C blue no. 1, silicon dioxide, and magnesium stearate.

In Xenadrine Ultimate, you will find:Robusta coffee bean extract
Caffeine anhydrous
Yohimbe bark extract
Garcinia cambogia
L-Theanine
Spearmint leaf extract
Autumn olive fruit extract
Ashwagandha root and leaf extract


The first three ingredients are classified as specifically for weight loss, and the rest of the ingredients are part of the Xenadrine Ultimate complex.
The capsule ingredients aren’t listed on the Xenadrine Ultimate website, but it is likely they are the same as the capsule for Xenadrine Core.
If you’re allergic to any of the ingredients, either don’t take Xenadrine Ultimate or ask a doctor about it first.
This pill is blue and in rapid-release form, like Xenadrine Core.

, Xenadrine Core and Xenadrine Ultimate target slightly different results. Both promote weight loss and extra energy. However, Xenadrine Core claims to be a thermogenic source of weight loss. Xenadrine Ultimate lacks this thermogenic feature, but increases focus.Xenadrine Core cites two studies that support its weight loss formula.A thermogenic formula is one that increases the production of heat in the body.In weight loss supplements, thermogenics means that it is designed to help your metabolism burn more fat., Xenadrine is only intended for people over the age of 18. If you are pregnant or nursing, you should not take Xenadrine. You should ask a doctor first if you are taking other medications, or if you have an existing medical condition. Be aware that you may experience the side effects of increased caffeine intake.Xenadrine has the same amount of caffeine as two cups of coffee.
If you are not used to this much caffeine, you may feel some things when you first start taking Xenadrine: jitteriness, nervousness, headaches, etc.
If you experience unusual symptoms, consult a doctor immediately.
Do not take more than the recommended dose of Xenadrine. The side effects of excess caffeine include nervousness, inability to sleep, and upset stomach.

Experts recommend about 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise per week, or 75 minutes per week of strenuous aerobic movement. However, this amount is recommended for maintaining weight and staying healthy. To lose weight, you will likely need to exercise at a moderate level between 60 to 90 minutes on most days of the week.Examples of aerobic exercise include swimming, jogging, dancing, etc.

, To tone flabby muscles, it is important to add strength training to your exercise regimen. After your aerobic workout, you might add in exercises that build muscle. Examples include weight lifting, weight machines, or rock climbing.Experts recommend doing strength training a minimum of two days per week. There is no recommended time frame.

, There are many diet options available today. For example, you might try becoming a vegan, eating a Mediterranean diet, or even buying products for a diet like the Atkins diet.The important thing is to find a good balance that is right for your body. You want to feel full without consuming excess fat, sugar, or carbs.


A good rule of thumb is to stick to lean protein and whole grains.
Keep healthy snacks on hand. Prepare snacks that are prescribed by your diet so that you aren’t tempted to eat junk food.
Avoid snacking between meals to get the best results from Xenadrine., Your body needs hydration. Xenadrine recommends drinking eight to 10 glasses of water everyday to get the maximum results from their diet pills. Xenadrine recommends that you eat well, exercise, and drink water in combination with their products."

People with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, phobias, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can safely take SSRIs to treat symptoms.Occasionally, SSRIs are prescribed to treat certain medical conditions including premature ejaculation, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), fibromyalgia, and pain.;
, Therapy is an important part of treatment for depression. A therapist can diagnose depression and help you treat symptoms. Research concludes that cognitive therapy is as effective as medication.For many individuals, therapy alone is the best course of treatment.While medication can help manage symptoms, therapy is beneficial at helping to identify negative patterns in your thoughts and behaviors. Your therapist can help you learn coping skills and to change your thoughts and behaviors to be more positive and adaptive in your life.For many, a combination of therapy and medication is effective at treating more severe depression.

, Once you receive a diagnosis of depression, you likely will treat it with therapy. Some therapists may recommend supplementing treatment with medications. The decision to take medication is a serious one requiring much consideration. To help you make this decision, schedule an appointment with someone who can help you navigate medications. While some people feel most comfortable seeing their general practitioner, you may find more support and information from a psychiatrist who specializes in treating mental health.You may receive a psychological diagnosis from a therapist, who can refer you to a psychiatrist.
If you take other medications for a medical or psychological condition, it’s important to make sure medications are compatible, which is where a psychiatrist can be very helpful.

, Know your medical history and discuss it openly with your prescriber. When considering SSRIs, make sure to tell your prescriber whether you have diabetes, epilepsy, or kidney disease. While SSRIs can be used in conjunction with these diagnoses, they should be used with caution and under strict medical supervision.Don’t hide anything from your prescriber. Be open and honest about your medical history.
Discuss any medications you are currently taking. This includes vitamins, herbs, and supplements. Note any allergies or adverse effects you’ve encountered with other medications., Prior to taking medications, be advised on possible side-effects from your prescriber. It’s not uncommon to experience side-effects related to medication use. When taking medications, be aware of any unpleasant symptoms that develop that may be attributed to SSRIs. Some common side-effects include:Nausea/vomiting
Restlessness, agitation
Blurred vision
Reduced sexual desire, problems with orgasm or erection
Weight gain
Headache
Dry mouth
Diarrhea

, Do not take SSRIs if there is a risk you may be allergic to the medication. Inquire about family history with antidepressants. Avoid SSRIs if you have taken the following medications within the past two weeks: thioridazine (Mellaril), pimozide (Orap), or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) such as phenelzine (Nardil) and tranylcypromine (Parnate).Additionally, avoid MAOIs and thioridazine for at least five weeks after stopping SSRIs.SSRIs are not recommended if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding., SSRIs are not compatible with natural remedies such as St John’s Wort. When combined, a person is at a higher risk for Serotonin Syndrome. Serotonin Syndrome occurs when a person has dangerously high levels of serotonin in the body and can include symptoms such as agitation, anxiety, tremors/shaking, confusion, sweating,restlessness, and lack of coordination. If you show signs of any of these symptoms, seek medical attention immediately.If you take St John’s Wort, let your prescriber know.

, Even if you have a friend with depression, do not offer to share your medication. Instead, refer your friend or family member to a psychiatrist or therapist for diagnosis and treatment. It is illegal and unsafe to share medications. Under no circumstances is it advised to share SSRIs., Your prescriber will likely start you on the lowest dose to help you manage symptoms. You may not experience the benefits of medication prior to the first 2-4 weeks. If no benefits are experienced after 4-6 weeks, you may need to return to your prescriber to discuss changing medications. He or she may increase your dose or switch you to another medication.To reduce the risk of nausea, take the medication with food., The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States of America requires that all antidepressant medication receive the strictest warning for prescription drugs. Children, teenagers, and young adults (up to age 25) are warned for increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors while taking SSRIs.Suicide risk is highest in the first weeks and months of taking medications as well as when changes are made in dosage.
If you experience suicidal thoughts or behaviors seek help immediately. Contact your therapist and psychiatrist. Go to the Emergency Department, call a hotline, or call a friend to help you.

, If you experience any disruptive or unpleasant side-effects, let your prescriber know. Some side-effects may outweigh the benefits of medication and may require a change of medication.You may feel overwhelmed by side-effects or that you cannot get through the day. Let your prescriber know of any difficulties as soon as possible.

, Especially at the start of your course of treatment stay in regular contact with your prescriber. Communicate any side-effects, changes in thoughts, moods, or behaviors. Make regular appointments to discuss mental health and medication, and take note of any emerging or persistent symptoms.It’s important to receive regular support during medication treatment. Check in with your prescriber regularly and discuss how treatment is going. You may need to adjust your dose or change medications.

, Be careful not to miss or skip doses. If you do forget a dose, take it as soon as possible. Do not “double up” your dose if you forget one day and take your medication the next day. If you take more medication than your prescribed dose, contact your prescriber immediately., Typically, a course of treatment with SSRIs lasts 6 months. For some, treatment may last longer. For those with persistent symptoms, treatment may last for 2 years on medication. For very severe depression, medication may be prescribed indefinitely., Do not stop taking SSRIs without consulting with your prescriber first. If you stop taking medications “cold turkey,” you may experience withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms may include nausea, dizziness, anxiety, stomach upset, or flu-like symptoms.If you wish to stop taking SSRIs, meet with your prescriber and discuss a plan to safely remove yourself from medication.


You will likely decrease your doses slowly over several weeks or months. Follow your prescriber’s plan and use as directed.

Watch out for possible side effects.",How to Use Ivermectin1," Ivermectin is the drug of choice against several different kinds of worms. The two most common worms treated by this medication are Strongyloides stercoralis and Onchocerca Volvulus.


Strongyloides stercoralis: This worm is prevalent in northern parts of the United States and Canada. It is found on soil and prefers warm humid conditions.
Onchocerca Volvulus: This worm, and its eggs, are transmitted by a blackfly. The blackfly bites you, and through its bite, the worms are transmitted. It is mostly found in Africa, Central, and South America.;
, Ivermectin comes in the form of an oral tablet or capsule. It is available in two doses: as a three milligram dose, and as a six milligram dose. Your doctor may prescribe that you take 150 to 200 micrograms per each kilogram of body weight that you have.


Talk to your doctor about what dosage is right for you.

, Some doctors hold that Ivermectin should be taken on an empty stomach, while some studies have shown that it is fine to be taken with food.Talk to your doctor about which method he or she recommends for your specific dosage.


In a recent study, it was found that taking the medication with food may increase the amount of the drug available for your body to use., This medication is usually taken all at once over the course of one day. It is generally prescribed in two doses that you take at two different times throughout the day., Depending on the severity of your infection, and your immune status, administration can be repeated after 6 or 12 months if necessary.


Because these parasites can live for 10 years or more in your body, long-term treatments are frequently carried out.

, It has been reported that the side effects Ivermectin can cause are due to the destruction of the parasites, and the reaction of your body to this process. When the medication kills the parasites, parts of the parasites remain in your body, which can cause the side effects to occur. The side effects of the drug may also depend on the severity of the infection.


The side effects generally appear within two days of taking the medication. Nonspecific complaints, such as fatigue, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, joint and muscle pain, rash, fever, have all been observed in patients taking Ivermectin.In very rare cases, more severe complications can occur, and these include CNS involvement, such as encephalopathy, confusion, and urinary incontinence.

Stop taking pills if you experience problems.",How to Use Diet Pills," Over the years, diet pills have been made with everything from ephedrine to dinitrophenol. These substances can be lethal even when they are ingested in small quantities.Even diet pills made with herbs, plants or other ""natural"" ingredients can cause health problems or death. Before you take any type of pill, make sure you know exactly what it contains.


Never buy diet pills online. You have no way of knowing what they contain. The regulations regarding diet pills are loose. It's easy for manufacturers to omit information about what pills contain.
Even diet pills available in drug stores or by prescription can have dangerous ingredients. In the past, many diet pills have been taken off of the market due to safety issues.No matter what type of pill you opt to take, do your research first.;
, There are two different types of diet pills legally available. These include prescription drugs and over-the-counter diet pills or supplements. Within these categories you'll find dozens of different options. Each of them work in different ways.


Prescription weight loss drugs include appetite suppressants, lipase inhibitors, and drugs that increase metabolism.These drugs have been evaluated by the FDA. However, there is no indication that they actually work. Even though they are prescribed by your doctor, they can have negative side effects. Drugs containing stimulants can even become addictive.
Over-the-counter drugs and supplements are made with ingredients derived from natural substances. They are thought to speed metabolism, decrease appetite or block fat cells from expanding. Examples include hoodia, chitosan and green tea extract. These have not been evaluated by the FDA. Their safety and effectiveness is unknown.Never use diet pills containing ephedrine, dinitrophenol or any type of stimulant. These have been pulled from the market due to severe health implications. They may still be available online or on the black market., This is a good way to find out more about both the safety and effectiveness of a type of diet pill. If you're interested in a certain pill, do online research to find out whether it has been tested in at least one trial. If the trial conducted was inconclusive, find another option.


Make sure the sample size of the trial was sufficiently large. For example, you wouldn't want to trust the results of a trial conducted on just twenty people.Look for one that was conducted with a large sample size and a diverse group of people.
If you're having trouble finding any research on a certain type of pill, skip it. That probably means it's too new for scientists to know whether it's safe to take.

, Even if a pill is considered safe to take, it may have unpleasant side effects. It's a good idea to check the side effects when you're deciding what pill to take. If you're getting a prescription from your doctor, ask about the side effects before you begin taking it. The side effects depend entirely on the type of pill you take.Side effects of prescription stimulants can include increase pulse and heart rate, dizziness, restlessness, insomnia, dry mouth, constipation, hypertension, and elevated blood pressure.
Other common diet pill side effects include diarrhea, oily stools, gas, insomnia, and runny nose., Find out if the diet pills you want to take are effective. Most doctors will tell you that taking diet pills won't help you lose weight and keep it off. Some may in the short term. However, the weight will come back once you get off the pills. Find out which type of pill seems to produce good results without causing unhealthy side effects.Prescription weight loss drugs are normally indicated only for people with a body mass index (BMI) over 30. This indicates a weight problem that could lead to further health issues.Prescription stimulants cause people to lose weight. However, since they cause addiction and severe side effects they are only recommended for short-term use.
There is no scientific proof that any over-the-counter diet pills are effective. Anecdotal evidence shows that some may help more than others. Check out clinical trials to determine which supplements may be most effective.

, Whether you want a prescription or you're planning to take over-the-counter supplements, it's important to talk to your doctor first. Your doctor will examine your health history and determine whether it's safe to start taking the drug or supplement.Discuss your weight loss plan with your doctor. Use the time to ask questions about the safety and effectiveness of the drugs or supplements you're considering.
If your doctor writes you a prescription, remember to ask about the side effects.

, Diet pills contain powerful ingredients that affect the body's natural systems. It is very important not to take too much. Whether you're taking prescription weight loss drugs or an over-the-counter supplement, don't exceed the recommended dosage.


If you're taking prescription drugs that contain stimulants, exceeding the dosage could cause a dependence or addiction to occur.Exceeding the dosage of any type of drug could increase the likelihood that you'll experience side effects.

, Drinking plenty of water while you're taking diet pills may help to promote weight loss. It can also ease certain side effects such as constipation and dry mouth. Drinking water also prevents dehydration, which can occur if you're taking a stimulant. Caffeine, on the other hand, can make symptoms worse.


Sometimes caffeine is included as an ingredients in diet pills. If this is the case, it is even more imperative that you avoid it. You'll already be getting a full dose of caffeine, and more could cause problems.Mixing caffeine with a stimulant can cause heart problems. Avoid using caffeine if you are on a prescribed stimulant. It is also dangerous to use alcohol when you are also using a stimulant., Weight loss pills are not going to produce magical results. Eat a healthy diet and exercise while you're on the pills. The diet pills may help speed your weight loss so it takes less time to get the results you want.Avoid processed foods, foods high in sugar, and foods high in hydrogenated oils. Focus on eating lean meats, whole grains, fruits, vegetables and healthy fats.
Try adding half an hour of exercise to your daily routing. Walking, jogging or swimming are all good choices.

, Monitor how you're feeling when you start taking diet pills. Watch especially carefully for the side effects that commonly occur with the pill you're taking. If you experience any major side effects, you should stop taking the pills. It's not worth the health risk. If any of the following conditions occur, see your doctor right away:Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
Depression
Heart palpitations
Increased blood pressure
Dizziness
Chest pain
Tremors

Be aware of how Ivermectin works.,
Be aware of what else the medication can be used for.,
Do not use Ivermectin if you are pregnant.",How to Use Ivermectin2," Ivermectin works by causing muscle paralysis in the worms. When it reaches the worms, it activates the worm’s chloride channels, which leads to paralysis. It also stops the worm’s nerve signaling by disrupting the worm’s calcium channels.When paralysis and nerve disruption sets in, the worms die within two days.

, In addition to combatting the worms listed in the previous section, this medication can also be used as an alternative to other first-line drugs to kill off other kinds of worms. These worms include:Ascaris Lumbricoides: This worm lives in feces and sewage. It is commonly encountered by pig farmers.
Trichuris Trichiura: This worm is more commonly known as Whipworm, due to its shape. It is generally found in areas where sanitation is poor.
Filariasis: This worm is transmitted by a mosquito and is generally found in tropical and subtropical areas. Cats and monkeys are common carriers of this group of worms.

, You should not take this medication if you are pregnant because the properties of the medication can enter your breast milk. If this were to happen right before giving birth, you could potentially pass some of this medication to your child through your breast milk."

A full body of research does not exist to test the long-term effects of antidepressants on the adolescent brain and development. There are concerns whether antidepressant medication interferes with normal brain development, especially in regards to how the brain manages stress and regulates emotion., The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning regarding SSRI use for children and adolescents regarding increased suicidal thoughts and behavior. In some individuals up to age 25, SSRIs can have this effect, according to the FDA.If you notice your adolescent displaying signs of suicidal thoughts or behaviors, get help immediately. Risk of suicide increases when changes are made to dosage and during the first three months of use.Do not wait for things to “blow over” or “return to normal;” suicide is serious and should be treated seriously.


Seek immediate intervention. This may include talking with the adolescent, taking him or her to the Emergency Department, or contacting the police. Alert the child’s therapist as soon as possible.
Family history is important to consider with the risk of suicide. Ask if there is a family history of suicide or bipolar disorder. Also, ask if the teen has a history of suicidal thoughts or attempts.For more information, check out How to Recognize the Warning Signs of Suicide.

, While SSRIs are contraindicated for use in adolescents and children in the UK, the FDA in the United States stopped short of this decision in light of limited treatments for children with serious depression. The FDA approved two antidepressant SSRIs for adolescents. One approved medication is fluoxetine (Prozac), which is prescribed for children aged eight and older. Escitalopram (Lexapro) is prescribed for those 12 and older.Some medical professionals may prescribe off-label medication to treat depression in teens. For instance, a medical doctor may use his or her judgment to prescribe citalopram (Celexa). Using off-label medications is a somewhat clinically common practice for many types of medications and can occur for both children and adults.

, Prior to obtaining medication, the child will see a prescriber to discuss medication use. Have a full a psychiatric evaluation performed by a psychiatrist, pediatrician, or family doctor who is experienced in pediatric psychiatric issues.Prior to your appointment, gather some information regarding the child’s medical and emotional history.


Bring up any family history of depression, suicide, or other mental health problems with the prescriber. Mention any drug allergies or sensitivities to other medication.

, Therapy is an effective way to treat depression in adolescents. Many teens will respond to therapy without the aid of medication. Therapy can help determine the persistence and severity of the depression, as well as provide coping tools for the teen to cope with negative thoughts.If the child is not currently seeing a therapist, include therapy in treatment for long-term effects.


In some clinical studies, a combination of medication and therapy has shown most effective in treating serious depression in adolescents.For more information, check out How to Choose a Therapist.

, Have your prescriber monitor medication use. Make regular appointments to check in. When with your medical practitioner, be sure to discuss any side-effects and overall medication effectiveness. Your prescriber should be notified if the teen experiences any major mood swings, suicidal thoughts, nervousness, agitation, or sleeplessness while on medication., If medication is no longer wanted or needed, do not take the teen off medication without consulting with the prescriber first. Abruptly stopping use can lead to withdrawal symptoms or result in symptom relapse. Prior to stopping medication, discuss the changes with your prescriber and find the best course of action to minimize risks., The FDA recommends that children start on the smallest dose to safeguard against deliberate or accidental overdose.When the teen is prescribed medication, monitor the dosage. Use only as directed by the prescriber.


You can hand the pills to the adolescent each day, or watch to make sure the accurate dosage is consumed.

, If medication is needed while the teen is at school, make sure the teen goes to the nurse for medication. The school nurse can administer the medications and make sure that the adolescent takes the full dose.


Alert the school that the teen is on medication and make sure medication is not shared with others. Keeping it with the school nurse is the safest way to administer and keep the medication.

, Stay alert to any changes in thoughts or behavior the teen experiences after starting medication.Note even minor changes in your child, including social or academic problems.Call your prescriber if you notice:Increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior
Worsening depression
New or worsening anxiety
Insomnia
Panic attacks
Irritability, agitation, restlessness
Violent or aggressive behavior
Extreme hyperactivity
Other strange or unusual emerging behaviors

, In addition to medication, help the teen make some changes to bolster treatment. Outside of therapy and medication, the teen can develop some practices and skills to better cope with depression in the long run. It can be empowering for teens to know that they are participating in their own healing and betterment.


Encourage the adolescent to engage in exercise regularly. This can include participating in a sport such as basketball, soccer, track, volleyball, or dance. The teen may enjoy going to the gym, taking the dog for a walk, going hiking or another activity. Encourage lots of activity, as exercise is essential to mental and physical health.Encourage the teen to have an outlet for emotions. This can be music, drawing, dancing, painting, or anything else the teen is drawn to that helps sort out thoughts and feelings. Video games do not count.

, It’s absolutely essential for teens to get plenty of sleep. Children and adolescents need more sleep than adults, up to 9 or more hours each night.Encourage your teen not to stay up late at night, but to be well rested each day. If the teen is oversleeping or undersleeping, talk about this with your therapist or medication prescriber.

A complicating factor is that the pain and disability of whiplash can take a day or even a week to fully manifest, but see your family physician soon after any major trauma to your head and neck in order to rule out life-threatening injuries (fractures, dislocations, internal bleeding).Your doctor will likely take an x-ray of your neck (cervical spine) to rule out obvious fractures or dislocations of the vertebrae or facet joints.
If you're in severe pain and having difficulty holding your head up, then you may be given a foam neck support collar for short-term use. However, research has shown that wearing a stiff cervical collar for much more than a few days can cause neck muscles to atrophy (weaken) and prolong pain.;
, Your family doctor is not a musculoskeletal specialist, so if your neck feels severely injured then you may need to see a specialist for a second opinion. A specialist such as an orthopedist may take more x-rays, an MRI or a CT scan of your neck / head to better understand and diagnose your whiplash injury.In addition to bone injuries, MRI can detect soft tissue injuries, such as spinal cord damage, herniated disks or torn ligaments.Before starting physical therapy your doctor(s) need to determine if your neck is structurally intact, physiologically stable and able to safely withstand stretching and exercising.
Sharp or burning pain combined with grinding sounds with movements, shooting pains into your arms and severe dizziness are signs suggesting neck instability.

, Before you start to stretch and exercise your neck, you need to reduce the inflammation and pain. Your doctor may recommend non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen for short-term use, although if your pain is severe, you might get a prescription for something stronger — typically an opioid, such as oxycodone.


Alternatively, you can try over-the-counter analgesics such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or muscle relaxants (such as cyclobenzaprine) for your neck pain, but never take them concurrently with NSAIDs.
Keep in mind that these medications can be hard on your stomach, kidneys and liver, so it's best not to use them for more than 2 weeks at a stretch.
The application of ice is an effective treatment for essentially all acute musculoskeletal injuries, including neck pain.Cold therapy should be applied to the most tender part of your neck for 15-20 minutes every 2-3 hours in order to reduce the swelling and pain.
Always wrap ice or frozen gel packs in a thin towel in order to prevent frostbite on your skin.

, If you doctor or specialist thinks your neck is stable enough to handle the rigors of physiotherapy, then start as soon as you can. People who keep moving their necks in some capacity (even just basic stretches and mobilizations) have a better prognosis with their whiplash injuries.Your physiotherapist will assess your neck and then develop a recovery plan that includes specific and tailored stretches and strengthening exercises.


With a referral / prescription from your doctor, physiotherapy is usually covered by private health insurance.
For pain control, a physiotherapist can use a TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) unit or therapeutic ultrasound on your neck and shoulders.
If need be, a physiotherapist can stimulate, contract and strengthen your neck and shoulder muscles with an electronic muscle stimulation device.

, Injured muscles and tendons quickly become tight and spasm. As soon as you can after your whiplash injury, and within pain tolerance, start stretching the muscles of the front, back and sides of your neck in order to keep them pliable. Additionally, slowly moving your neck in all directions (mobilizations) keeps the muscles flexible and prevents the spinal joints from getting too stiff.Use slow, steady movements and take deep breaths during your stretches. In general, hold stretches for about 30 seconds and repeat three to five times daily.


Lateral neck muscle stretch: while standing, reach around your back with your right arm and grab a little above your left wrist. Gently pull on your left wrist while laterally flexing your neck in the opposite direction, such that your right ear approaches your right shoulder. Hold for 30 seconds, then do the other side.
General neck mobilization: start with moving your head in circles, first clockwise and then counterclockwise, for about five to 10 minutes each way.
Target the main movements of your neck: forward flexion (looking down at your toes), lateral flexion (ear towards your shoulders) and extension (looking up towards the sky). Go as far as you can in each of the four directions about 10 times daily.
Its important to remember not to stretch into the range of motion that causes pain. If you feel pain, slightly bring your neck back until you no longer feel pain. That will be the furthest position you will need to reach for your stretching. By stretching in a pain-free range, there is less chance of irritating the injured muscle tissue, ligaments and joints.

, Once the pain and inflammation in your neck has settled down and you've reestablished good range of motion from stretching, it's time to start strengthening exercises.It’s best to begin your strengthening with isometric exercises.Keep your head in a neutral position and bring your right hand up to your right cheek. Turn your eyes slightly to the right and attempt to gently turn your head to the right, while applying just enough resistance with your right hand to prevent your head from moving. You should only apply 5 to 10% of total effort when trying to turn your neck. Repeat this five times.
Next, place your right hand to the right side of the head. Now attempt to laterally flex the head to the right, as if trying to touch your ear to your right shoulder. Again, apply just enough resistance to prevent your head from moving (5 to 10% of total effort).
Bring your right hand and place it on the front of your head at the forehead area. Try to bring your head forward and flexing down, but apply just enough pressure with your right hand so that your head does not move.
Bring your right hand behind your head. Try extending your head, with just enough resistance (5 to 10%) so your head doesn’t move.
Repeat all the exercises again by using your left hand over the left side of your head. Perform this exercise three times per week.

, You can strengthen your neck using exercise bands, which are usually color coded to represent different levels of tension. You may also consider newer technology, such as a multi-cervical unit.


Tie the least resistive elastic band around your head and attach it to something stable that's at the level of your head. Walk a few steps away from it until you feel tension in the exercise band. Then do the four main neck movements (flexion, extension, right / left lateral flexion) under tension ten times each on a daily basis. After a week or so, change to a thicker exercise band with more tension.
Advance to treatment with a multi-cervical unit. This fairly-new type of machine allows a whiplash patient to sit in a machine and attach their head to a small set of weights. Starting with light weights, you can move your neck as instructed by the physiotherapist in order to strengthen the various muscles in your neck.

, Chiropractors and osteopaths are spinal specialists who focus on establishing normal motion and function of the small spinal joints that connect the vertebrae, called spinal facet joints.Manual joint manipulation, also called an adjustment, can be used to unjam or reposition facet joints that are slightly misaligned due to a whiplash injury. You can often hear a ""popping"" sound with a neck adjustment. Traction techniques may also help reestablish the normal curvature (lordosis) of your neck and reduce pain.


Misaligned upper neck (cervical) facet joints greatly inhibit the ability to rotate your head and contribute to dizziness and headache symptoms.
Although a single spinal adjustment can sometimes completely relieve your neck issue, more than likely it will take 3-5 treatments to notice significant results.
In addition to chiropractors and osteopaths, some physiotherapists also use manual adjusting techniques for spinal and peripheral joints.

, Whiplash injuries often involve significant ligament sprains and muscle / tendon strains, which leads to inflammation and spasm. A deep tissue massage is helpful because it reduces muscle spasm, combats inflammation and promotes relaxation.Start with a 30 minute neck massage, focusing also on your shoulders and muscles at the base of your skull (suboccipitals). Allow the therapist to go as deep as you can tolerate without wincing.


Tight suboccipital muscles can trigger severe head pain called cervicogenic headaches.
Always drink lots of water immediately following a massage in order to flush out inflammatory by-products and lactic acid from your body. Failure to do so might cause a dull headache or mild nausea.

, Acupuncture involves sticking very thin needles into specific energy points within the skin / muscle in efforts to reduce pain and inflammation and to potentially stimulate healing.Acupuncture is not commonly recommended for whiplash recovery and should only be considered as a secondary option, but anecdotal reports suggest it can be very helpful for relieving pain and restoring mobility. It's worth a try if your budget allows for it.


Based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture reduces pain and inflammation by releasing a variety of substances including endorphins and serotonin.
Acupuncture is practiced by a variety of health professionals including some physicians, chiropractors, physical therapists, naturopaths and massage therapists — whoever you choose should be certified by NCCAOM.

, The use of low-energy light waves (infrared) is known to be able to speed up the healing of injuries, decrease pain and decrease inflammation.Use of infrared radiation (either through a hand-held device or within a special sauna) is believed to penetrate deep into the body and improve circulation because it creates heat and dilates blood vessels.


In most cases, significant pain reduction can start within hours after the first infrared treatment.
Pain reduction is often long lasting, weeks or even months.
Practitioners most likely to use infrared therapy include some physical therapists, chiropractors, osteopaths and massage therapists.

Talk with your physical therapist about your goals for therapy.,

Do your physical therapy at home as prescribed.,
Wear supports or braces as directed by your doctor and physical therapist.,
Return slowly to your training regimen.",How to Use Physical Therapy to Recover From Sports Injuries," Some pain is caused by a sudden laceration, break or blow, while other injuries are caused by repetitive stress. Refusal to rest and seek a doctor's opinion can result in further injury and endangering your ability to play your sport in the future.;
, Often times, it is important to get an x-ray to rule out serious breaks and injuries. In extreme cases, surgery after injury may be one of the only options.

, Your doctor should lead you through the acute, sub-acute and chronic phases of your recovery, working toward the time it will take to get you back into the position to play sports again. Depending upon the treatment, surgery, rest, injections, etc., this will be different for every injury.

, If you have experienced atrophy from surgery or inactivity or if you would like to keep training for an event while you are injured, the doctor is likely to believe it will help your condition.


Not every injury requires physical therapy. If your doctor recommends ice, heat or gentle stretching, it is likely you can do this on your own. Doctors often recommend physical therapy for rehabilitation that lasts a matter of months, rather than a matter of weeks.

, This is a common specialization in the physical therapy world, so there may be a number of options in your town. Call ahead to see if the physical therapist has experience treating your specific injury.


Private insurance companies often cover at least a few sessions of physical therapy. Call your insurance company or check on their website to see if any of the therapists your doctor has recommended are covered by the company. You may opt to go outside of your insurance network to get a well-renowned sports physical therapist.

, Most doctors suggest that patients start therapy in the sub-acute phase. This means that you may still have pain and limited mobility, but you can start doing stretches and exercise under the guidance of a physical therapist.

, Although you may want to get started with exercise immediately, physical therapists can often diagnose muscle weakness that can lead to further injury. Make sure they access the health in all the structures surrounding the injury before you begin treatment.

, The following are issues you may want to address in your first meeting:


If your insurance company is not covering the treatments, you may want to suggest that you learn exercises that you can do on your own. You can do 1 to 2 weeks of sessions and then go forward on your own. You may also learn some exercises and then come back each month to test your strength, range of motion and mobility and learn more.
If you are using ice and heat at home, you may ask your physical therapist to leave these treatments out of your session. Ice, massage and ultrasound are used to relieve pain. If you are able to faithfully do these treatments at home, you may be able to achieve more with guidance and stretching in the office.

, Most physical therapists will try to ease pain and develop a gradual exercise routine. Ask questions and ask for changes in your session if you want to address specific issues during your time in the office.


Most people do not ask questions of trained physical therapists. Although they are trained professionals who know how to treat injuries, strong communication allows you to get the most for your money. If you do communicate your preferences, they may end up treating the general injury, rather than your specific needs.

, You may be used to exercising regularly, but physical therapy exercises may be different; they often isolate specific muscles to slowly and safely rebuild the tissue. Ask the physical therapist to explain the exercises clearly and give you some explanations of the motions with diagrams.

, You may need to buy equipment, such as resistance bands, small hand weights or ice packs. This is especially important if you plan to do most of your exercising at home or in a gym, rather than at a physical therapy office.

, After severe injuries, muscles, tendons and ligaments can lose their strength. To prevent future injuries, always wear your braces when you play sports or engage in training.

, Ask your physical therapist for a week-by-week training routine that will allow you to safely return to sports. Follow the routine and check in with the physical therapist if you experience increased pain or mobility issues.

, This will keep you from further injury or pain.

, Push back on the handles until you are horizontal. Stay there for one to two minutes to allow your blood flow to change before continuing.

, Try it twice per day to help your body grow accustomed more quickly.

,, Inversion tables will only provide temporary relief, so you may need to do it more often to get a good benefit from it.


You do not need to do a full 90 degree inversion. Many people do not invert more than 60 degrees, and others use a 30 degree angle because it is more comfortable and you still see benefits.

, Choose the angle, time and number of repetitions per day that work best for your condition.

See a therapist.",How to Use Antiseizure Medications for Anxiety," Certain medications seem to be effective for specific anxiety disorders. For instance, pregabalin is indicated for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) when other psychological diagnoses are not present. The medications valproate and topiramate seem to work effectively to treat phobias. Topiramate appears to help treat obsessive-compulsive disorder. Panic disorders can be treated with anticonvulsants, though studies do not conclusively support effective treatment at this time. The medication valproate may be promising for treating panic disorder. Data is limited in treating post-traumatic stress disorder.When choosing a medication, make sure you tell your prescriber of any medications you currently take to minimize the risk of drug interaction.;
, Use the medication as directed. Do not take more or less than prescribed. Medication works best when taken at the same time each day. If you take medication more than once each day, space out the dosages, such as one in the morning and one at night.Even if you do not feel the effects of the medication, do not increase your dose without consulting with your prescriber first.

, The occurrence of side-effects depends on many factors, such as dosage, type of medication, and the length of time medications are taken. Antiseizure medications typically start with a low dose and increase to limit the possibility of harsh side-effects. The presence of side-effects tends to be more pronounced with higher doses, yet can subside with time. Some common side-effects include:Blurry vision
Fatigue
Stomach upset
Drowsiness
Dizziness

, It’s important to be informed prior to committing to taking medication. With your prescriber, discuss any concerns you may have about risks and side-effects of taking antiseizure medications. Though dangerous and fatal reactions do occur, they are rare and include problems with the liver, pancreas, or blood problems. Some people may need routine blood testing to monitor effects.Some people develop allergies to seizure medication. Typically, allergies develop within the first 6 months and most commonly include a rash. If you develop a rash or experience severe side-effects such as blisters on your skin or in your mouth, excessive bleeding, stomach pain, fever, or other unusual symptoms, contact your provider immediately.
Though the medication Lyrica appears to be beneficial in treating GAD, it is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for anxiety., Especially when you are first starting medication, make sure you check in with your provider regularly to ensure the proper course of treatment with medications.Discuss any side-effects that have developed, the effectiveness of treatment, and any questions about dosage. You may periodically change your dose or change medications if they are not effective.

, Alcohol can disrupt medication for anticonvulsant use in those with seizures.If you drink alcohol, let your prescriber know before obtaining medication. You may need to make lifestyle changes to receive the maximum benefits of medication.

, Most anticonvulsant medications can be taken safely while pregnant. Some specific medications can increase the risk of birth defects, so make sure you let your provider know if you plan to become pregnant, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding. Keep regular appointments with your prescriber. You may need to take blood tests to ensure that your pregnancy is healthy.Take folate in the first trimester to reduce the likelihood of birth defects.

, Keep your medication safe and do not offer other people your medication, even if they suffer from similar symptoms as you do. Instead, refer people to a prescriber to obtain their own medication. It in unlawful and unsafe to share medication.

, If you’d like to stop taking medication, do not take yourself off of medication without consulting your prescriber ahead of time. You may experience unpleasant withdrawal symptoms if you do not decrease your dosage gently over time. Before ending medication, make an appointment with your prescriber and discuss options of how to end treatment with minimal side-effects. Withdraw from medication slowly, over several months.In people with seizures, withdrawal can include re-experiencing seizures.

, Anticonvulsant medications are most commonly prescribed to treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social phobia, and panic disorder.To receive medication for anxiety, a person must first obtain a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), phobias (like social phobia), panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).A mental health provider, such as a therapist, psychiatrist, and in some cases, a general practitioner specializing in mental health can assess you to see if your symptoms fit criteria for an anxiety disorder.Many people choose to get diagnosed by a therapist (such as a psychologist or social worker) in order to begin treatment right away.

, After careful consideration about taking medication, schedule an appointment with a prescriber. It is often recommended to see an expert in psychological medication, such as a psychiatrist, however, some general practitioners may be suitable in discussing mental health medications with you. Share your medical history with your provider, including any medical or psychological conditions and medications you currently take. Discuss any herbs, vitamins, or supplements you take.


Note any allergies or adverse effects you’ve experienced under other medications., During this appointment, bring up any questions you have about taking medication, how long each dose will last, if you have to take it everyday, and what side-effects you may encounter. You may ask your provider whether you need to name-brand medication or generic. Ask when to take the medication, and if it’s best when taken with food or drink.Make sure you fully understand the medication you may be prescribed. Ask any and all questions you may have while in your appointment.
With specific medications, you may be at higher risk with certain to your provider if there are foods, beverages, supplements, or other medications you need to avoid when taking anticonvulsants.

, Beyond diagnosing anxiety, a therapist can help a person overcome the symptoms of an anxiety disorder. A therapist can work to help you discover any negative or untrue thoughts and beliefs that are influencing the anxiety. Then, you can learn to challenge these thoughts and beliefs and be rooted in more rational or positive thinking. You may also learn ways to relax and cope with stressors that can help you more effectively deal with situations that make you feel anxious.While medications can help manage symptoms of anxiety, they do not cure or get to the root cause of your anxious feelings. Therapy can have lasting effects without side-effects of medication. In many cases, therapy alone can be the best course of treatment."

How long will medication use last?
How will medication affect attention, concentration, and hyperactivity?
Can I (or my child) take medication breaks on the weekends or during vacations?;
, Your prescriber will put you on the medication that best suits your needs. Atomoxetine is a long-acting medication and can last 24 hours or more. This makes it appealing for people who have a difficult time “getting going” in the morning or notice the steep decline of functioning when medication starts to wear off. It is not as effective at treating symptoms of hyperactivity.Atomoxetine has antidepressant properties, which can be a good fit for people also struggling with symptoms of depression.
Atomoxetine has a low potential for abuse or recreational use.If you have a history of prescription abuse or drug history, Atomoxetine may be a good alternative to stimulants.
Ask your doctor about starting with a lose dose of medication and increasing it if necessary. This way you can determine the dosage with the most positive effects and least negative side effects. Don’t get frustrated if you don’t see an immediate response. Stick with the treatment plan and follow up with your doctor.

, Atomoxetine does not mix well with certain medications or medical conditions. If you have ever had glaucoma or pheochromocytoma, Atomoxetine is not advised. If you are taking or have stopped taking the following in the last two weeks, Atomoxetine is not advised: monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, including isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), selegiline (Eldepryl, Emsam, Zelapar), or tranylcypromine (Parnate).It is not advised to take Atomoxetine if you have a heart condition or there is a high risk you may develop a heart condition.

, Medication is delivered in pill form and taken once or twice a day, either once in the morning or once daily and nightly. It’s advised to take the medication at the same time each day. Atomoxetine can be taken with or without food. Medication is to be swallowed whole; do not open, chew, or crush.Do not take more or less medication than prescribed. If you encounter any medication difficulties, contact your prescriber.
Do not take Atomoxetine recreationally or as a “party drug.” Use only as directed., As with all prescription medications, Atomoxetine comes with the risk of experiencing side-effects. Some commonly reported side-effects include:Sleepiness
Headache, dizziness
Stomach upset, nausea
Mood swings
Insomnia
Appetite suppression

, Some people may experience serious side-effects from Atomoxetine. Serious side effects can include fast or pounding heartbeat, chest pains, shortness of breath, weakness in your arms or legs, hives, rash, abnormal thoughts or behaviors, hallucinations, or seizures.If you experience serious symptoms, call emergency services right away.


If serious symptoms arise, discontinue medication use right away and contact your provider.
Atomoxetine can cause liver damage in some patients. Notify your prescriber if you notice symptoms such as right upper belly pain, dark urine, yellow skin or eyes, itching, or unexplained flu-like symptoms., Risks for serious symptoms related to suicide are higher in children than adults. For some children, increased suicidal thoughts or behaviors may occur. This is a higher risk in children diagnosed with bipolar disorder or depression.The risk for suicidal tendencies increases at the beginning of medication treatment and when doses are adjusted.Tell your prescriber if your child or teen has a history of bipolar disorder or previous suicidal thoughts or behaviors.
Call your provider immediately if your child shows signs of agitation, irritability, suicidal thoughts or actions, or if your child experiences any unusual changes in behavior.

, Continue to receive regular medical and psychological care while on Atomoxetine. Attend follow-up appointments to check in on Atomoxetine use and effectiveness. Note any difficulties or side-effects with your provider. Talk about any necessary adjustments to dosing as needed.Notify your prescriber before taking any newly prescribed medications as they may interact with Atomoxetine.
Follow through on any tests your provider recommends to track effects of Atomoxetine such as blood, heart, and blood pressure checks. If problems are found, discontinue or decrease dosage.

, If you live with other people or have children in your home, keep the medication in a secure, locked location.This can safeguard against misuse, abuse, or accidental doses.


If medication is given to a child, administer single doses each day with supervision. If medications are taken at school, keep the medications with the school nurse, not in the child’s backpack or locker.

, If you miss a dose, take your dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular schedule. Do not make up for your missed dose. Do not take more than one dose in a 24 hour period.If you have questions about missing a dose, contact your provider.

, Even if you have a friend that struggles with attention, do not share your medication. Your prescription is for you and only you. If you share your medication, you are engaging in illegal activity that may be unsafe or cause harm to someone unknowingly.If you have a friend that struggles with symptoms of ADHD, recommend that he or she see a prescriber about medication or a therapist to learn coping skills.

, Even if you are prescribed Atomoxetine, do not take any medication that does not come directly from a pharmacy. These medications may be unsafe, expired, or mixed with other medications. Always receive medication from a prescription and always pick it up at the pharmacy., Therapy is an effective way to cope with symptoms of ADHD and make long-term improvements in functioning. While medications can be helpful in managing symptoms of ADHD, the thoughts and behaviors associated with ADHD are present when medications wear off. Therapy can help build skills such as organization, managing time effectively, and creating a daily schedule. Therapy can also help you or your child gain emotional skills such as coping with stress, managing impulsive behaviors, and controlling anger.When medication is coupled with therapy, the prognosis for ADHD symptoms improves.

Understand its limitations.,
Place your inversion table in an open space.,
Adjust the inversion table to your height.,
Start with the lowest degrees of inclination.,
Climb onto the table slowly and secure your feet.,
Increase the frequency and duration of your sessions gradually.,
Consult with your family doctor.,
See a chiropractor.,
Get a referral to a physical therapist.",How to Use an Inversion Table," It's important to understand that an inversion table is not meant to replace the advice or treatments offered by your family doctor, orthopedist, chiropractor or physiotherapist. Some health professionals recommend inversion tables and even have them in their clinics, but there is no evidence that they can cure any diseases or conditions of the spine over the long term.As such, it's probably best to think of inversion therapy as short-term help to control back pain and sciatica.


Unlike inversion boots and racks, inversion tables don't require you to hang upside down. Instead, they allow you to comfortably lay supine and invert yourself at incremental downward angles gradually.
Because your blood pressure increases when you're inverted for more than a few minutes, especially within your head and eyeballs, people with eye diseases (glaucoma, retinal detachment), high blood pressure and those with a history of migraines or stroke should be very cautious with inversion tables.;
, Inversion tables made for home use are relatively affordable (ranging from $200 to $500) and often found at medical supply and rehabilitation stores — your health insurance may even pay for one for certain back injuries. Once you bring it home, make sure there is plenty of space around the table so there is no danger of banging your head or causing other injuries. It's also best to place it on a secured rug or mat so it doesn't slide about and become unstable.


Consider putting your inversion table in your basement, attic, rec room or garage — anywhere that allows at least five feet of space all around the table.
The concept of inversion therapy is not new. Supposedly the therapy existed and was witnessed and commented on by Hippocrates (the ""father of medicine"") around the year 400 BC., Inversion tables are height adjustable for maximum effectiveness, so take the time to manipulate it so that it fits your body. Most inversion tables have a bar with measurements that can be adjusted using a twistable knob. Make sure you tighten the knob securely after you have adjusted it.


Read the instruction manual carefully because your inversion table may not be appropriate for exceptionally tall or short people. The manual should give a range of heights that are safe for usage.
Inversion therapy is a type of spinal traction, which is sometimes recommended to decompress spinal disc injuries such as herniations and bulges., In a sense, think of the inversion table as a small bed that can be adjusted to about 60 degrees from the horizontal or level (neutral) position. If you're not accustomed to using an inversion table, then start with a slight decline such that your head is at a lower level than your feet — maybe 10 degrees, for example. Too much angle too soon may make you feel dizzy or give you a headache from the sudden rush of blood to your head.As you get accustomed to the feeling and change in blood flow / pressure, gradually increase the degree of decline over the course of many days. For example, increase the decline angle by 5 degrees every week if you're using it on a daily basis.
Make sure the safety strap is properly connected to ensure it will not invert all the way and jar your body.

, Once the table is height adjusted and the angle is set, slide on to the inversion table so that your back is flush with the table and you're looking up at the ceiling (prone position). You'll then need to do a partial sit-up in order to secure your feet with straps against your ankles. Wearing shoes may be more comfortable and protective than going barefoot. Then lift your hands above your head and throw your weight back to cause the table to recline and try to relax in the inverted position for a predetermined amount of time.


Until you get the hang of it, ask someone to assist or supervise you while getting on to the inversion table, particularly if you are a large person with limited mobility or flexibility.
You can expect to feel the muscles / tendons / ligaments / joints of your legs and low back stretch, but not painfully so. If your back pain is caused by a compressed nerve or jammed spinal facet joint, the gentle traction provided by the inversion table may provide quick relief., The most beneficial amount of time spent on an inversion table (as well as the best angle) can only be determined by you. Some may benefit from three sessions weekly for 15 minutes at a time, while others may prefer more sessions and longer durations on the inversion table. The question is whether or not it positively impacts your symptoms. In general, you probably shouldn't exceed 3x daily and no more than one hour per session, but there are too many factors involved to give precise medical advice.For your first time, stay inverted for less than 5 minutes, even if the position feels good and doesn't cause any side effects. Increase your time as warranted, but never stay inverted if you feel more back pain or shooting pains into your legs (sciatica).Most people seem to settle on an angle of inclination between 20 and 60 degrees — never exceed what your body tells you.

, If you have moderate-to-severe back pain that lasts for more than a week with no signs of getting better (or if it's getting progressively worse), make an appointment with your doctor for an examination. Your family doctor is not a spinal specialist, but they can take x-rays and rule out serious causes of back pain that might need medical intervention. Your medical doctor is unlikely to have or recommend an inversion table, but ask if using one is safe for your particular back injury.


You should not use the inversion table if you have any of the following conditions: pregnancy, hernia (torn abdominal muscle), glaucoma, retinal detachment, conjunctivitis, hypertension, recent stroke or heart attack, circulatory disorders, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, swollen joints (rheumatoid arthritis), osteoporosis (brittle bones), unhealed fractures, scoliosis spinal rods, middle ear infection and severe obesity.If you have bouts of dizziness or suffer from vertigo, then inversion therapy should be used with caution and under the supervision of a health professional., Chiropractors are spinal and back pain specialists who are much more likely to be familiar with and recommend inversion tables (compared to medical doctors). Some chiropractors even have them at their offices, which should be taken advantage of before purchasing one for home use. Once your chiropractor has determined that your back injury may benefit from inversion therapy, ask for recommendations regarding frequency, duration and appropriate angles for your sessions.


Chiropractors usually use inversion therapy to augment a type of manual therapy known as spinal adjustments — essentially unjamming spinal joints and allowing them to move normally. You may require spinal adjustments or other therapy before being able to use an inversion table.
Chiropractors often recommend inversion therapy for spinal disc problems (bulges, tears and herniations). Symptoms of a disc problem include severe back pain, shooting buttock / leg pain (sciatica), leg weakness and numbness., Physical therapists are also likely to be familiar with and use inversion therapy as part of a spinal (low back) rehabilitation program. After getting a referral from your doctor, a physical therapist is likely to show you specific and tailored stretches and strengthening exercises for your spinal muscles, in addition to augmenting with some inversion therapy.Stretching and loosening up your back muscles prior to inversion therapy may make it more effective.


Your therapist may increase the amount of traction to your spine by adding weight to your upper body while you're on the inversion table. However, don't attempt this at home without supervision.
Using inversion therapy under the guidance of a physical therapist or other health professional is the safest way to get introduced to it and learn whether its worth it to spend the money on one for home use.

Recognize the effects of age.",How to Use Benzodiazepines," Benzos are primarily prescribed to treat anxiety disorders by working with the GABA receptors in the brain. When used as antianxiety medications, benzos are best prescribed for short-term use (two to six weeks).Long-term use of benzos should be avoided due to the addictive nature of benzos over time.
They are not available over-the-counter, but must be prescribed.;
, Benzos can be used as a short-term treatment for insomnia. It can aid in sleep for a matter of days or intermittently. When prescribed as a sleeping aid, courses should not exceed two weeks.For long-term insomnia, benzos are not recommended.


Typically, benzos are used 30 – 60 minutes prior to bedtime. Check with your prescriber prior to starting a course of treatment.Non-benzodiazepine alternatives for sleeping aids include the following: Ambien, Sonata, and Lunesta.

, Benzos are a first line treatment in treating alcohol withdrawal. Benzos can help curb some of the more difficult side effects of withdrawal, such as tremors, delirium, and hallucinations.Commonly used medicines used to treat withdrawal include chlordiazepoxide (Librium), diazepam (Valium), and lorazepam (Ativan).

, Benzos can be used to treat epilepsy.Benzos can be highly effective at treating epilepsy and convulsions due to drug poisoning.


Some common medications used to treat epilepsy include diazepam, clonazepam, clobazam.Benzodiazepines are used to treat agitation in patients experiencing withdrawal and to stop the progression of minor symptoms into major symptoms.
Generalized tonic clonic convulsions usually occur 12 – 48 hours after the last drink of alcohol.

, Benzos can be used to treat dystonia and involuntary movements, myoclonus, akathisia, restless leg syndrome, and painful muscle spasms.The muscle relaxing effects of the benzos can help with these disorders.

, Prior to starting medication for mental or emotional health, seek the advice of a mental health expert. While some people choose to visit a general practitioner, you may find more support and information from an expert in mental health, such as a psychiatrist. Many psychiatrists will encourage you to attend therapy to increase the success of your recovery. Additionally, therapy does not have the side-effects medications do.


A mental health professional will guide in exploring your options and making an informed decision. In many cases, therapy alone can be the best course of treatment., Prior to being prescribed benzos, know your medical history and discuss it openly with your prescriber. Those with liver problems, kidney disease, drug allergies, or issues with addiction should communicate this clearly prior to receiving a prescription. Benzos can interact with other medications, so be sure to bring up any medications you currently take.Don’t hide anything from your prescriber. Be open and honest about your medical history.
If you have a history of addiction, your doctor may wish to explore other options before considering benzos. He is unlikely to prescribe them for long-term use, as they can be highly addictive.
Discuss any medications you are currently taking. This includes vitamins, herbs, and supplements. Note any allergies or adverse effects you’ve encountered with other medications., An interfering agent is something that disrupts or inhibits the drug. Your prescriber may tell you to avoid taking allergy or cold medications, and avoid eating or drinking grapefruit. Smoking can decrease the effectiveness of benzodiazepines. Limiting alcohol consumption is advised.Some interactions can lead to severe sedation, such as interaction with alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics, and tranquilizers.If you drink socially and cannot see yourself cutting back or stopping, benzos are not right for you.
Alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics, and tranquilizers must be avoided while on this medication — using both at the same time can lead to toxicity and poisoning.

, Benzos are a schedule IV controlled substance. This means that they run the risk of becoming addictive, being abused, or used for diversion.Benzos can become addictive, which is why they are not recommended for long-term use.


If you are at-risk for abusing benzos or for using them recreationally, do not take them.
You doctor will assess your risk and determine if you are a candidate for benzo use.

, Benzos can cause drowsiness and dizziness. Other symptoms can include nausea, stomach upset, blurred vision, headache, confusion, depression, trembling, weakness, grogginess, or memory loss.It’s important to notify a medical professional if you develop chest pains, changes in heart rate, vision changes, or yellowing in the eyes or of the skin.


Few people develop an allergic reaction to benzodiazepines. If you do develop a reaction, watch out for rash, itching, swelling, dizziness, or difficulty breathing.

, Benzodiazepines are not recommended for long-term use. Tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal can occur. It’s best to use benzos for a matter of weeks and no more.If you wish to treat a disorder long-term, steer away from benzos. Ask about other options that are safe for long-term use, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for long-term treatment of certain types of anxiety.

, As you start to take medication, be sure to monitor the effects of the medication. Notice any side effects, changes in thoughts, moods, or behaviors. Make regular appointments to discuss mental health and medication, and take note of any emerging or persistent symptoms.Find a supportive provider whom you feel comfortable discussing your medication, mood, and thoughts.

, Each person will respond differently to medication, so it’s important to note any adverse side-effects you may encounter. Your prescriber may try a handful of medications to find one that suits you best and is most effective.Be consistent in taking your medication as prescribed and do not deviate from recommended dosage without speaking with your prescriber first.

, If you experience unpleasant side effects, let your prescriber know. If you feel like the side effects outweigh the benefits, make sure you communicate this to your prescriber. Your dosage may be adjusted or you may try a different medication.Any major impacts such as hallucinations, confusion, or major health upsets should be reported to your prescriber right away.

, Your medication is your medication and no one else’s. If someone near you suffers from similar problems, do not offer to share your medication to “try it out.” It can be dangerous to share medications and the person may have adverse effects. Under no circumstances is it advised to share medications., Long-acting benzos are generally not recommended for elderly patients as they can be more difficult to excrete from the body and can have unpleasant side effects, particularly in the elderly. Short-acting benzos typically have fewer side effects and excrete from the body quickly. This makes short-acting benzos more effective for sleep disorders."

Look for drug interactions.,
Check for medications that cause depression.,
Ask about selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).,
Take other antidepressants.,
Avoid certain SSRIs.,
Be weary of tricyclic antidepressants (TCA).",How to Use Antidepressants for Elderly Adults1," When you are looking into antidepressants for elderly depression, you need to make sure that any medications that you are currently on do not interact with what you might take. There are a number of different medications that can cause side effects if taken with antidepressants. Make sure your doctor knows all the medications you are on so you can avoid this.


Also let your doctor know any supplement you are on. These can also cause interactions.Your doctor will know the main risk factors, but there are some smaller risks factors as well. Talk to your pharmacist. They have computer programs that can tell if you are at risk for a bad interaction. In order for this to work efficiently, you should get all your medications at the same pharmacy.
Clinically, citalopram and escitalopram are the two SSRI’s that cause the least drug-drug interactions.;
, There are some medications that can make your depression worse or even cause it in the first place. These medications may be prescribed for other medical conditions and can sometimes have depression as a side effect. These medications include:


Beta-blockers.
Blood pressure medication.
Sleeping pills.
Parkinson's disease medication.
Steroids.
Tranquilizers.
Calcium-channel blockers.
Medication for ulcers, including those over the counter ones.
Cholesterol medication.
Painkillers.
Estrogen.
Arthritis medication.
Heart medication with reserpine., Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are proven effective for elderly adults with depression. There are many different types, such as escitalopram, sertraline, and citalopram, which is the most common.These are used frequently with older patients because they interact less with patients that have cardiovascular problems. These antidepressants do have some side effects, which you should watch out for. These include:


Insomnia.
Dry mouth.
Nausea.
Drowsiness.
Diarrhea.
Agitation.
Excessive sweating.
In rare cases, sexual dysfunction., There are some additional antidepressants that are helpful to treat elderly depression. These may be considered if SSRIs are not an option or if they interact with the medication you already take. These antidepressants include:


Bupropion.
Mirtazapine.
Venlafaxine.
Moclobemide., Although SSRIs are typically helpful for the elderly, there are some medical considerations you need to take into account if you are prescribed these medications. There are some SSRIs that should not be taken by elderly patients because of the side effects and interactions. Medications you need to avoid are:


Fluoxetine.
Paroxetine., Tricyclic antidepressants were once prescribed for the elderly, but are now not considered first line treatment agents for the elderly. The side effects and potential for drug interactions are considered too high to be safe in most cases for elderly patients. The major side effects that can happen include:


Postural hypertension, which contributes to fractures and falls.
Cardiac conduction abnormalities, such as arrhythmias.
Dry mouth.
Urinary retention.
Constipation.
Delirium.
In some cases, the worsening of medical conditions such as dementia, cardiovascular problems, and Parkinson disease."
"
Start at the right dose.,
Increase your dosage.,
Watch for side effects.",How to Use Antidepressants for Elderly Adults2," When you start taking antidepressants, you need to make sure that you are started on the right dose. Elderly patients should be started out on half the dose that is generally prescribed for younger adults. This will ensure that too much of the medication does not remain in your body.


This common effect is typically caused by the fact that elderly patients have a slower metabolism than younger adults., The lower dose you start taking is less than what you should normally take. You have to slowly increase your dosage before you reach the dose that will treat your depression. A week or two after you start the medication, your dose will be slightly increased.


This will continue every one to two weeks until you reach the recommended dose.
You may need a dose higher than normal to reach the dose that will be helpful for your depression., Once you have picked your antidepressant and the right dosage for your medication, you should see your doctor regularly. This will help you keep track of any side effects, monitor any new conditions that may arise, and keep a check on your depression. When you visit your doctor, make sure he or she looks for:


Worsening depression.
Emergence of an anxiety disorder or agitation.
A possibility of a suicide risk during early treatment."
"
Check your sodium levels.,
Watch for side effects from tricyclic antidepressants.,
Learn about treatment resistance.",How to Use Antidepressants for Elderly Adults3," One month after you start taking SSRIs, you need to have your sodium levels checked. SSRIs can cause hypnoatremia, which is a condition where your blood sodium level is abnormally low.Make sure your doctor checks your sodium levels when you go in for a check up if you have been prescribed SSRIs or if your dosage has changed.


This is especially necessary if you are also on other medications that can cause hyonoatremia, such as diruetics., If your doctor places you on tricyclic antidepressants, you should keep an eye out for additional side effects of these medications. You are at an increased risk of blood toxicity, even if you are on a low dose of the medication. This is especially problematic if you slowly metabolize medication.


Before you start taking them or if your dosage is increased, you should also have your blood pressure checked and you should have a ECG.SSRI’s have become the first line treatment for depressive symptoms. If possible, try to avoid TCA’s. Some side effects of TCA’s include the risk for cardiac toxicity, CNS toxicity, and anticholinergic toxicity.

, When an elderly adult is given antidepressants, the dosing may need to be adjusted. The low dose that most antidepressants are started at with elderly adults may not give them the therapeutic effect needed from the antidepressants.


If you find that you or a loved one are not receiving the right help from the medication, ask your doctor about a possible change in dosage."
"
Try repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).,
Use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).,
Consider electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).",How to Use Antidepressants for Elderly Adults4," If you find that you are resistant to antidepressant medication, you may consider rTMS. rTMS is a noninvasive treatment that uses magnetic fields to stimulate brain nerve cells. It is proven to be help reduce depression in elderly patients after an average of 10 sessions.


This treatment can only be done by a doctor. Ask your doctor to see if this treatment is right for you., Cognitive behavioral therapy is used as a treatment to treat depression. It helps you change your negative and depressive thought patterns into more positive ones. This may be a treatment option that can be a alternative option to medication or that can be used in addition to medication to help relieve symptoms of depression.


You will do CBT with the help of a therapist. Ask your doctor for a referral for a therapist that specializes in CBT for depression.CBT is an effective treatment method for depression and there should be a multifaceted approach to treatment.

, Electroconvulsive therapy, also known as electroshock, is a controversial treatment for depression in elderly adults. It has been shown to have severe side effects in some cases, such as memory loss. This should only be considered as a treatment if other options have proven ineffective for your depression.


ECT has been shown to help reduce major depression symptoms in 70 to 90% of patients that received this treatment. ECT has a record of providing good results, but it should only be used in the most severe patients.
This treatment is typically very expensive and requires hospitalization, so it should be considered as a last resort."

Use the cushion everywhere.,
Sit in a chair with a back.,
Place the coccyx cushion directly on the seat.,
Add ice packs or hot packs for added relief.,
Keep the cushion clean.,
Upgrade your cushion if necessary.",How to Use a Coccyx Cushion1," Coccyx cushion treatment will be most effective if you can use the cushion in the car, at home, at work and everywhere else you need to sit down. You can purchase several inexpensive cushions or opt for one that can travel with you and be used everywhere.Consistency is key to treating your tailbone pain with a coccyx cushion.
Be aware that one cushion may not be suitable for all scenarios. For example, a cushion may help while you are sitting at your desk, but it may not be as effective while you are driving. Try using a cushion in different situations to see when it provides the most benefit.;
, Use the coccyx cushion in a chair with a back that will give you extra support. The cushion naturally helps improve your posture by slightly elevating your hips, and sitting in a chair with a back will help you sit up straight and eliminate pressure on your spine and pelvis.


When using a cushion on a chair that is a comfortable height for you, your thighs may be slightly higher than usual. To offset this difference, try using a footstool to make sure your lower body is still in a comfortable position. If the chair is adjustable, then you can also adjust the height of the seat to make yourself more comfortable.

, Do not use a coccyx cushion with other cushions. Adding extra pillows or cushions will cause you to sit unevenly and in turn, distribute your weight and pressure unevenly, which is unhealthy for your back. The placement of the cushion on the seat can either be flat or slightly slopping. This is most people's preference.If you need extra height, purchase a thicker coccyx cushion instead of adding extra pillows or padding.
If you are putting the cushion on a very soft seat, like couch or plush chair, put a rigid board under the cushion for support.

, You can add flat ice or hot packs to your coccyx cushions for hot or cold therapy. Wrap the packs in towels and place one on either side of the cut-out area in the cushion.Some cushions may come with gel insert that you can warm up or freeze before reinserting them and using the cushion.
Consult with your physician about whether the effects of ice or hot packs would be beneficial for you.

, Try to get a coccyx cushion with a removable cover that can be machine washed. This will help you keep your cushion is clean and sanitary.

, If the coccyx cushion isn't providing sufficient relief to your tailbone pain, then try a different one.


For example, you use a coccyx cushion that is made of soft foam and find that it’s not alleviating the pain, upgrade to a cushion made of firmer, denser foam for more support. Cushioning is an individual need, so your cushion needs will be unique.

Press on the acupressure points behind the knees.",How to Use Acupressure for Back Pain," If you develop back pain that won't go away after a few days, then schedule an appointment with your family physician. Your doctor will examine your back (spine) and ask questions about your family history, diet and lifestyle, and maybe even take X-rays or send you for a blood test (to rule out rheumatoid arthritis or a spinal infection). However, your family doctor is not a musculoskeletal or spinal specialist, so you may need a referral to another doctor with more specialized training.


Other types of healthcare professionals who could help diagnose and treat mechanical back pain include osteopaths, chiropractors, physiotherapists and massage therapists.Prior to any acupressure treatments, your family doctor may recommend anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin to help you cope with your back pain.;
, Mechanical low back pain is not considered a serious medical condition, although it can be quite painful and debilitating. Typical causes include spinal joint sprains, spinal nerve irritation, muscle strains and spinal disc degeneration.However, medical specialists such as an orthopedist, neurologist or rheumatologist may be needed to rule out the most serious causes of back pain such as infection (osteomyelitis), cancer, osteoporosis, fracture, herniated disc, kidney disease or rheumatoid arthritis.


X-rays, bone scans, MRI, CT scan and ultrasound are modalities that specialists may use to help diagnose your back pain.

, Make sure you get the doctor to clearly explain the diagnosis, especially the cause (if possible), and provide you with various treatment options for your condition. Acupressure is only appropriate for mechanical back pain and not for more serious causes such as cancer, which would likely require chemotherapy, radiation and/or surgery.


Pain from mechanical back pain can be severe, but it doesn't involve high fevers, rapid weight loss, bladder / bowel problems or loss of leg function, which are all signs of something more serious., If you feel overwhelmed learning about acupressure points and techniques, and uncomfortable treating yourself (or asking a friend for help) then use the internet to find nearby practitioners of TCM (they aren't all Asian) or allied professionals who have the appropriate training. This approach will cost you more money, of course, but you'll be in more capable and confident hands.


Many acupuncturists practice acupressure and vice versa.
The number of acupressure treatments needed to be effective for back pain (or other conditions) is not well established, but starting out at 3x per week (every other day) for 2 weeks is reasonable to gauge progress.

, Regardless of where you perceive your back pain, certain pressure points along the spine (and throughout the body) have been discovered over the centuries as areas that can alleviate pain, especially if it's mechanical in nature. The low back pressure points are situated just a few inches laterally to the 3rd lumbar spinal vertebrae (just above the level of your hip bones) within the paraspinal muscles and are referred to as points B-23 and B-47.Stimulating the B-23 and B-47 points on both sides of the spine can help relieve achy low back pain, pinched nerves and sciatica (which includes shooting leg pain).


For best results, reach around your low back, press down on these points with your thumb and hold firmly for a couple of minutes, then release gradually.
If you lack the flexibility or strength, then ask a friend after showing them a diagram of the points on your cell phone or other portable internet device.
Alternatively, you could lay on your back and roll a tennis ball around the area for a few minutes.
In TCM, these low back pressure points are also known as the Sea of Vitality.

, A little further down the backside are the pressure points of the hip region, often referred to as the B-48 points.These points are located a few inches lateral to the sacrum (tail bone) and superficially right over the sacroiliac joint (demarcated by the dimples above your butt muscles). For best results, press down and inward gradually with your thumb, towards the center of your pelvis, and hold firmly for a couple of minutes, then release gradually.


Stimulating B-48 points on both sides of the sacrum can help relieve sciatica, as well as low back, pelvic and hip pain.
Again, if you lack the flexibility or strength, recruit a friend or grab a tennis ball.

, Slightly below and lateral to the B-48 points, lay the G-30 acupressure points.The G-30 points are situated in the more fleshy part of the buttocks, specifically in the piriformis muscles, which lay beneath the larger gluteus maximus muscles. For best results, press down and inward gradually with your thumb, towards the center of your buttocks, and hold firmly for a couple of minutes, then release gradually.


The sciatic nerve is the thickest nerve in the body and runs down each leg through the buttocks region. Be careful not to irritate the sciatic nerves when putting pressure on those muscles.

, Immediately after any acupressure treatment, you should apply ice (wrapped in a thin towel) to the thicker muscles of the back / hips for about 15 minutes, which will help prevent any bruising or unnecessary tenderness.


Putting ice directly on the skin runs the risk of frostbite and skin discoloration.

, One of the ways that acupuncture and acupressure work is that they cause certain compounds such as endorphins (the body's natural pain killers) and serotonin (the body's feel good chemical) to be released into the bloodstream.Therefore, pressing safely on certain spots hard enough to elicit achy pain, such as the fleshy point between the thumb and forefinger (called LI-4), can be effective for treating pain all over the body, not just the back.


Creating pain temporarily to treat pain due to an injury may seem strange, but that's one of the ways that acupressure and acupuncture work.
While laying down on a sofa or bed, apply pressure on this point for at least 10 seconds and release it for another 5 seconds. Repeat at least 3x and wait to see how it impacts your back pain.

, This acupressure point is on the anterior part of your lower arm, about 2–3 inches (5–8 cm) below (distal to) where your elbow joint flexes.This point is within the brachioradialis muscle and often referred to as the LU-6 point. Sit up in a comfortable position and raise your arm to find the spot (typically 4 finger widths from your elbow). Start with the side of the body that hurts more and press the point for about 30 seconds, 3-4x over the course of 5-10 minutes for best results.


Acupressure points may be tender when you first press on them, but the feeling will likely diminish the more times you use them.

, Always try to press and activate acupressure points on both sides of your body, especially if they're easy to get at like the ones in the hands and elbows. It may not be obvious which side of your back is injured, so always stimulate acupressure points bilaterally if possible.


As you first apply firm pressure to the hands and elbows, you will likely feel a slight achiness or even burning sensation. This often indicates you're pressing on the right spot and it will disappear as you continue to put pressure on it.

, Immediately after any acupressure treatment, you should apply ice (wrapped in a thin towel) to the thinner muscles of the arm for about 10 minutes, which will help prevent any bruising or unnecessary tenderness.


In addition to ice, frozen gel packs are effective for inflammation and pain control too.

, Stimulating the acupressure point between your big toe and second toe is best done while laying down supine, which is sometimes called the ""sleeping"" position by practitioners of TCM.For best results, press down on the top of the foot in the webbing between the first two toes and hold firmly for at least 30 seconds, then release gradually. Do both feet after a short rest between the two.


Soaking your feet in an ice bath post treatment will help prevent any bruising or foot soreness.

, There is another beneficial acupressure point on the bottom of your foot, a little closer to your toes than your heel.To start, clean your feet thoroughly and sit on a stable chair. Then massage the bottom of your foot for a few minutes before locating the pressure point. For best results, press down with your thumb and hold firmly for at least 30 seconds, then release gradually. Do both feet after a short rest between the two.


If you have especially ticklish feet, then use some peppermint lotion on them, which will cause a tingling sensation and make them less sensitive to touch.
Massaging and putting pressure on the feet and parts of the lower legs is not appropriate for women who are pregnant as it may induce uterine contractions.

, The relevant pressure points behind the knees are situated directly below the center of the knee joint (point B-54) and also a few inches lateral to the knee joint within the lateral gastrocnemius or calf muscle (point B-53).For best results, press down with your thumb and hold firmly for at least 30 seconds, then release gradually. Do the points behind both knees consecutively.


Stimulating the B-54 and B-53 points behind both knees can help relieve stiffness in the back as well as pain in the hips, legs (from sciatica) and knees.
The points behind the knee are sometimes referred to as the Commanding Middle by practitioners of TCM.

Most people will see a physician after a spinal deformity becomes clearly visible. This presents as an asymmetrical appearance of the waist, shoulders, rib cage, or spine.Scoliosis usually presents without pain.


If an individual is experiencing a lot of pain associated with scoliosis, it is necessary to do a full workup to determine the cause.;
, Since scoliosis is usually pretty mild, it's not easy to detect. Parents don't always notice it in their children, since it develops slowly and causes almost imperceptible changes in appearance. Scoliosis testing is mandatory in some school systems, and teachers or school nurses are often the people who first notice the presence of the condition. These signs that scoliosis might be present are:Uneven shoulders.
One prominent shoulder blade.
Uneven waist or hips.

, Scoliosis can develop any time through adolescence, and it's important to visit the doctor right away if you notice a curve in yourself or your children. The doctor will have the patient bend forward toward the floor, which makes the presence of a curve more visible. He or she will also take X-rays of the person's back to determine if a curve is actually present. From there, a course of treatment, if any, will be outlined.


If the curve is mild, the doctor might want to monitor the curve to make sure it doesn't get worse.
The patient’s age, sex, curve type, and curve placement will be taken into account when deciding what treatment to pursue.
Additionally, your doctor will evaluate any family history as well as any associated pain., Since every person's spine is a little different, there's no one way to define how scoliosis will look and progress. Sometimes the curve is slight, and sometimes it's pronounced; sometimes the spine curves in more than one place, and sometimes just in one. The main factors that doctors take into account when defining scoliosis are:


The shape of the curve. Scoliosis is either structural, with a side to side curve and twisting of the vertebrae, or nonstructural, with a simple side to side curve and no twisting.
The location of the curve. The vertebrae located at the highest part of the hump, called the apical vertebrae, is used to define the scoliosis.
The direction of the curve. The doctor will determine whether the curve bends to the left or right as part of the description of the individual’s particular progression. This is important to take into consideration for treatments and possible issues that may arise if the spine interferes with other internal physiological processes.
The magnitude of the curve. The angle and length of the curve are measured as well. This measurement will help to define the severity, as well as the necessary corrective alignment that needs to be achieved to bring the spine back to a more natural state., The Lenke Classification is a system of scoliosis classification that was first introduced in 2001. It is used by specialists to rate the severity of scoliosis, especially in adolescents. This system is generally only used by a doctor who specializes in spine surgery of children — most orthopedists will not necessarily be familiar with this system. The components of this system include:


Curve type — Rated on a severity scale of 1-6.
Lumbar spine modifier — Rated on a scale of A-C.
Sagittal thoracic modifier — Rated as either, (-) negative, N, or (+) positive.
This modifier, which measures what is known as the Cobb angle, assigns a value of either -, N, or +, depending on the angle of kyphosis, or curvature, of the spine., Eighty percent of the time, the cause of scoliosis is unknown, although there is evidence showing that it might be an inherited condition. Cases with an unknown cause are referred to as idiopathic scoliosis. Onset of this condition can happen any time between infancy and adolescence. The remaining percent of cases have specific causes, which include:


Cases caused by birth defects, called congenital scoliosis, which is much more severe and typically calls for more extensive treatment.
Neuromuscular scoliosis, which is when there are problems when the spine develops. This develops in people with other disorders, such as cerebral palsy, a spinal cord injury, or a damaged nervous system.
Functional scoliosis, which is a form where the spine develops normally but becomes abnormal because of a problem somewhere else in the body, such as one leg being shorter than the other or muscle spasms of the back., In most cases, the curve is minor and won’t require treatment. The doctor will simply monitor the progress of the curve to see how things progress, only suggesting treatment if the curve changes over time. However, severe scoliosis can result in deformity, breathing problems, heart problems, long term back pain, and noticeable appearance aberrations.It's important to have any type of scoliosis monitored as soon as it's detected.
Your treatment regimen will be personalized and dependent on your own situation on a case-by-case basis. Your doctor will assess and provide you the best treatment regimen.

, Your physician will advise as to how often you or your child should come in for new X-rays to see if the curve has gotten worse. A checkup every four to six months is usually recommended.As children grow, the curve often stops developing, requiring no intervention whatsoever. If the scoliosis worsens, further treatment may be required.

, Braces are the first line of treatment for scoliosis that has been deemed moderate in size, which is when the curve is 25 to 40 degrees. It is also suggested for cases progressive in nature, which is when the curve is growing more pronounced. They are usually only used when a person’s bones haven’t yet stopped growing, since they don't have a significant effect on fully developed bones. The use of braces is usually discontinued when a person reaches puberty. Bracing may help prevent a curve from getting larger, but it doesn’t usually correct it altogether.


There are two types of braces, soft braces and hard plastic braces. The type of brace a physician prescribes depends on a number of factors, such as the location and size of the curve as well as the age and activity level of the patient. The sex of the patient is also important, since girls have a higher risk of progression than boys. Some braces are worn only at night, while others are worn up to 23 hours a day. It's important to wear your brace as often as recommended to ensure that it works properly.

, This is a last-resort method of treatment for severe cases of scoliosis that threaten to cause deformity, breathing problems, or heart issues. Spinal fusion surgery is usually recommended only after a person has reached puberty, when bracing is no longer a viable option, and increased curvature of the spine due to growth spurts is reduced.


Spinal fusion surgery involves connecting vertebrae together so the spine can’t curve. The doctor will implant a metal rod or similar device to keep the spine from further increasing its curvature after surgery.
The procedure differs depending on the type of scoliosis and the age of the patient. Your doctor will assess the severity of your condition as well as responses to other treatments in order to determine if this procedure may be an option. Most patients with neuromuscular scoliosis will eventually need this kind of surgery to fix the curve in the spine., Studies are inconclusive, but they point to the idea that participation in physical activities might help you deal with symptoms associated with scoliosis (i.e. mild back pain). If your child has mild scoliosis, talk to a doctor about what physical activities are healthy, safe options. Team sports and other forms of exercise are usually recommended.


Physical therapy may serve the same purpose as participation in a sport or physical activity.
Being active is helpful for adults with scoliosis as well., Studies have shown positive results in patients who took part in chiropractic treatments. Patients in a specific study reported positive physiologic benefits immediately after completion of a treatment regimen, with continued positive benefits 24 months later. The chiropractic manipulation is based around an exercise program that was used in order to prevent the natural progression of adult scoliosis.If you decide to pursue chiropractic treatment, be sure to see a licensed chiropractor who doesn’t make promises that aren’t scientifically backed. The American Chiropractic Association has a search feature that will help you find a chiropractic doctor in your area.
To find a good chiropractor, ask your doctor who she would recommend. You can also ask your family or friends. Before you go in for an appointment, talk to the chiropractor, either on the phone or in person, about his or her practice, how the practice is run, and if he or she can help with chiropractic manipulation.There is also no evidence that chiropractic treatment makes a difference when it comes to a scoliosis curve, but it can help with the pain associated with scoliosis.

, If you are experiencing pain as part of your scoliosis, you might consider treatments that relieve pain but don't correct the curve. Scoliosis can cause back pain that's treatable using alternative medical practices. You can take over the counter pain medication, such as NSAIDs, or anti-inflammatory injections if the pain is not too severe.There are other treatments as well.


Acupuncture is a method that can help reduce the pain of scoliosis.
Also try yoga or massage for back pain. These methods have not been proven to affect the curve of the spine, but they are both safe and effective ways to deal with back pain since they loosen and strengthen the muscles., Biofeedback is an alternative treatment that has been recommended for possible relief from scoliosis symptoms. Biofeedback is a treatment method where you become aware of your body's reactions and learn to control them through your actions.One study was conducted where patients with scoliosis were received notification from a biofeedback device that they had bad posture every so often and were asked to correct it.


Although no major, long term studies have been done, almost 70% of patients saw some improvement in symptoms during the course of this study., There is an alternative method that may help with scoliosis symptoms in children. To be eligible for ES, a child needs to have a less than 35 degree curvature of the spine, have idiopathic scoliosis, and have at least two years of skeletal growth remaining in her life. It must be done in conjunction with physical therapy. To perform ES, an ES device is used on the child. Electrodes are placed between the ribs on the side of the chest or torso, directly under the arm, in line with the area of the back that is most affected by the curve. The cycle of ES is typically done at home over night, where up to eight hours of stimulation if performed on the muscles while the child sleeps.


The effectiveness of the treatment and the levels of ES are constantly checked by the physical therapist.
Although this is still a controversial treatment.

See your doctor.,
Pick compression gear for your legs.,
Buy compression gear for your arms.,
Try compression bands.,
Get the right fit for your gear.",How to Use Compression Therapy1," Before you can decide if compression therapy is right for you, you should see your physician. Your doctor will help you decide if compression therapy is right for you and your particular situation. Your doctor can also help figure out how much compression is needed for your condition.


The correct amount of compression will vary per person. You may need more or less compression depending on the severity of the swelling or amount of decreased blood flow in your extremities.
Your doctor should also be able to provide you with over-the-counter compression products for free, or minimal charge, as well as give you a prescription if you need a custom fit device. A prescription from your doctor can help get your insurance company to pay for at least part of the equipment .;
, The most common area for compression therapy is the legs. For this area, you can buy compression socks, pantyhose, stockings, or leg sleeves. These will have a variety of elastic strengths, which are different pressure grades depending on the severity of your condition. Your doctor will help you decide what grade to get.


You need to make sure that you have the correct size and form of compression therapy gear., You may also need compression gear for your arms or hands. For this area, there are a variety of gloves and sleeves you can buy. The elastic strengths needed will be decided by your doctor.


The compression gloves and sleeves will help increase the circulation to the hands and arms., For minor injuries or muscle pain, you can try elastic compression bandages. These offer more variable compression strengths that can be changed at will. They work by reducing swelling and encouraging circulation.These elastic bands can be bought at your local pharmacy or general store.

, You can choose from a few different colors, styles, heights, and lengths to best fit your particular needs. You can also have your compression gear custom made for your particular circumstances. The supplier will measure the affected area for the right size and compression strengths.The compression products you buy can be obtained at local medical supply companies or online. Some common and reputable companies include Corolon, Cicaid, Farrow and Jobst."

Know what a coccyx cushion is and does.,
Buy a coccyx cushion.,
Consider making your own coccyx cushion.,
Choose a cushion that feels comfortable.,
Try coccyx cushions with and without the cut-out.,
Make sure your coccyx cushion is the appropriate thickness.",How to Use a Coccyx Cushion2," A coccyx cushion (sometimes called a wedge cushion) is a U-or V-shaped pillow that protects the coccyx from uncomfortable pressure. Some cushions are also formed as a wedge. The U- or V-shape, in comparison with the circular doughnut cushions, often provide more comfort for people with tailbone pain. These cushions can also be used to provide comfort for those with hemorrhoids (piles) pain, prostate disorders, pilonidal cysts or degenerative bone disease.Doctors frequently recommend that patients use a coccyx cushion after back surgery to reduce pressure on the spinal column and tailbone.
Coccyx cushions are also often used to help relieve pain from other chronic pain conditions and inflammatory pain or to relieve pressure on the back and pelvic area during pregnancy.
Coccyx cushions differ from ring or doughnut cushions, which have a hole in the middle, and help reduce pressure on the anal and prostate region in cases of hemorrhoids and swollen prostate., You can buy a coccyx cushion at a local surgical supply store or pharmacy. You can also search online using terms like “coccyx cushion”, “tailbone cushion” and “tailbone wedge cushion”. Online sources can be less expensive, but the advantage to using a local dealer is that you can try different cushions to see which might work best for you.Do some research in advance. There are multiple things to consider when buying a coccyx cushion. Some are softer and thicker than others, some are inflatable, and others have washable covers. There are also cushions using different materials as padding and some may be more comfortable for you than others. Some of the materials used are memory foams, gels, semi-liquid gels, or other materials. Talk to your physician or orthopedic specialist to see if they have specific recommendations.

, If you cannot find a comfortable option in stores, then you can try making your own coccyx cushion. Most coccyx cushions are just regular cushions with a small opening on one side. You can get a large piece of memory foam or a memory foam pillow and cut out a small wedge on one side.

Other creative options include duct taping together segments of a pool noodle, using a neck pillow, or filling a long sock with rice and bending it into a ""U"" shape., Coccyx cushions are made in varying levels of thickness and firmness and it’s important that you select a coccyx cushion that’s comfortable for you. Squeeze the cushion in your hand to feel how firm it is. This will give you an idea of how it will feel to sit on the cushion and how much support it will give you.Coccyx cushions are also made with gel inserts. Gel inserts can help provide a softer form of cushioning and will conform better to the particular contours of your body. Some gel inserts in coccyx cushions can be removed to be warmed or frozen for hot or cold therapy.

, Some coccyx cushions are U-shaped and have a cut-out area to help relieve pressure on the spine and tailbone. Many people find more relief with these cushions, so try the solid ring cushions and the cut-out version to determine which kind is better for your needs.

, Coccyx cushions can be anywhere from 3 to 7 inches (7.6 to 17.8 cm) thick. Most people use the 3-inch thickness, but a thicker cushion can be beneficial to heavier users.Ask your physician or the local dealer about what size thickness is ideal for you, given your particular body type.

Stimulate your muscles.,
Use your gear for the right amount of time.,
Improve blood flow.,
Stay active.",How to Use Compression Therapy2," Once you have picked the correct compression gear for your situation, you can start compression therapy. The compression gear acts as an extra muscle, which helps to push the blood in your legs, arms, or other affected area through the veins and back to your heart.


Compression therapy also stimulates the muscles to decrease the swelling in the ankles or wrists. This happens because the blood that does not flow back to the heart builds up as fluids, which can leak into the tissues and cause swelling., When you talk to your doctor, you will be given specific guidelines on how long to wear your compression gear every day as part of your therapy. Your doctor will also let you know long your rest periods should be each day.


Often, your compression gear will worn during the day and removed while you sleep., In compression therapy, the main purpose is to improve blood flow. This is obtained by supporting and strengthening your veins. When your veins work properly, they return blood to your heart, but they only have one-way valves leading toward the heart. The action of your muscles helps to move blood through your veins.


An injury, being overweight, or having blood clots will block the return of the blood to your heart, which can cause serious chronic blood flow problems., To help along your compression therapy, you need to try to be as active as possible. This works with your compression therapy to keep your blood moving. Since spending long periods of time sitting or not moving at all removes one of the major ways blood can be moved back to the heart, being active helps your blood start moving again.


If you have a mobility problem, look into low impact movement, such as water therapy or swimming. "
"
Help prevent blood clots.,
Use compression therapy after surgery.,
Improve overall circulation problems.,
Treat other issues with compression therapy.",How to Use Compression Therapy3," Compression therapy is generally used for chronic venous insufficiency, which is when your veins do not work sufficiently, and for underlying artery disease. These conditions often cause blood clots. Blood clots are one of the most common issues treated with compression therapy.


Blood clots may develop independently or as part of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a condition in which blood clots develop and stay in your legs.
Compression therapy is only used if the underlying arterial disease is not too severe. , There are many different situations that benefit from compression therapy. It is often used as a treatment technique if you have undergone surgery to ensure that your blood continues to circulate after the procedure.


This technique is also helpful if you sustained an injury that could interrupt circulation., Compression therapy can also be used for those that have excess weight on their legs, which can cause circulation problems. This method is also used for those with mobility problems that are unable to move around a lot.


Since your circulation is helped by movement, those who cannot move a lot use compression therapy. The compression therapy helps move the blood around since you may not be able to move around yourself, There are some other, more serious conditions that can be helped with compression therapy. This technique is also used to treat lymphedema, which is the accumulation of lymph fluid that results in swelling. Compression therapy can also be used to treat slow-healing venous ulcers.


Lymphedema could become a problem for you after surgery and it can sometimes happen after chemotherapy."

Rest your back.,
Ice the area.,
Try compression.",How to Untrap a Nerve in Your Lower Back1," To help untrap the nerve in your back, rest it. Avoid too much movement and overtaxing it. Don’t sit or stand for too long. Instead, try walking around more than usual.Try not to bend, twist, or do any movements that will hurt your back.;
, Trapped nerves cause pain, and can also cause swelling. Try using ice packs on the painful area to alleviate pain and reduce inflammation. Ice works best when the pain first starts, so use it for the first seven days.Leave the ice pack on for 10 to 15 minutes, then take it off. Leave it off for at least 15 minutes before reapplying. You can do this multiple times each day.
You can use commercial ice packs or wrap ice cubes in a towel. Don't place ice directly on your skin.

, Compression can also help with the pain. Use a lumbar support belt or a corset to add compression to the area. These items also help with stability of the core, which can reduce the strain on the nerve.You can wear these support belts as long as you want, and should use them when doing a lot of activity or lifting. You shouldn't use them for more than three days without talking to your doctor.
Though the E in the RICE method is elevate, there is no way to elevate your back, so you won't be doing the whole method.

Start under your ears.,
Focus on the neck and shoulders.,
Massage pressure points.,
Massage trigger points.",How to Use Massage for Neck Pain1," Find the small bony bump behind your ears and begin your massage there. Place your right knuckles under your right ear and left knuckles under the left ear, and then slowly glide both knuckles down to the back of your neck.Now place your right index finger below the right ear and likewise with the left. Using your fingers, make circular movements toward the back of your neck.
Finally, place your right and left index fingers on the back of your neck at the base of the skull. Move the fingers slowly — and gently — toward your ears. Continue this motion back and forth down the neck, until you reach the base.
Repeat these exercises several times per day, if you want.;
, First off, “walk” your fingers from the base of your skull to the bottom of your neck, feeling for knots and tender spots. Gently stroke any that you find, lengthwise, until they feel better.Next, cup your right hand and place it over the left shoulder where the inside corner of your shoulder blade is. Rub here while gently rotating the left shoulder joint, concentrating on any tender spots. Repeat with the opposite arm.
Examine the back of your neck along the spine. Feel down the backbone. Again, you can rub or make small circles as you go and apply different pressure for tender areas. You can also do this by placing a rubber ball between your neck and a wall.
The massage might feel a bit uncomfortable but, at the same time, pleasant. Don’t overdo it. It should not hurt.

, Some people think that pressing certain “pressure points” on the body can relieve pain in the neck and elsewhere or lessen headaches and depression. There are several such points on the neck. One is at the base of the skull. Find the two hollows there and hook your thumbs into them, pressing upward. Hold for one minute while taking slow, deep breaths.Another pressure point is right behind the ears — this is called the Dokko in acupressure. Feel for this place and press it very gently. At the same time, try also pressing the spot where your nose meets your forehead, right between the eyebrows.
You might also try massaging points that aren’t on the neck, but supposedly affect neck, shoulder, and back pain. For example, you can press the “Large Intestine 6” or “He Gu” spot. This is on your hand, on the muscle webbed between your index finger and thumb. Use deep and firm pressure on the point for several seconds.
Try also the “Triple Energizer” or “Zhong Zhu” spot. This is located on your hand between the pinky and ring finger, in the groove between the third knuckle. Press and hold the spot for several seconds.

, There are other points that correlate to what are called ""trigger points."" These points are similar to acupressure points. In fact, both types of points show similar locations in 71% of cases.Take your right hand and reach over to your left upper shoulder. Pinch the shoulder muscle between your thumb and index or middle finger. If you feel pain going into your neck or head, you’ve just found a trigger point. You can hold the pressure for 30 seconds to one minute, and then move to a new spot in that area. You may find several points in this area.
Rotate your head to the right. Use your right hand to feel a cord-like muscle in the right front of the neck. This muscle should ""pop out"" as you turn your head to the right. Gently pinch this muscle with your right thumb and index or middle finger. Again, see if this recreates your neck pain. If it does, you’ve discovered a trigger point. Hold the pressure for 30 seconds to a minute. You can go up and down the length of the muscle to find more trigger points.

Take over-the-counter pain medications.,
Lie down on your back.,
Apply an ice pack to the area.,
Rest and avoid strenuous activities.",How to Treat Pain and Swelling in the Testicles1," Over-the-counter painkillers such as Ibuprofen, paracetamol, or aspirin can be used to relieve pain and swelling. All of these medications work by inhibiting the production of chemicals called prostaglandins, which cause inflammation. The recommended dosage for each of these drugs is as follows:


Ibuprofen (or similar generic drug), 200 – 400 mg tablets, with or just after food, up to three times a day
Aspirin, 300 mg tablets up to four times a day
Paracetamol, 500 mg tablets up to three times a day
Do not mix these medications. Overdose can lead to serious side-effects.;
, Until professional medical assistance is obtained, lying on your back and supporting the testes in whatever way feels comfortable can help to relieve physical stress and discomfort.


You can also enhance your scrotal support, such as a jock strap. This can aid in relieving testicular pain by protecting the region against contact friction between your legs, painful movement of the scrotum, and external contact that can lead to irritation., In case there is a sudden onset of swelling and pain, gently apply an ice pack or a bag of frozen vegetables to your testicles to help relieve pain and swelling.


Applying an ice-pack is an important measure since, if the cause of the swelling is serious, it can increase the amount of time the testicles can survive without a blood supply.Wrap the frozen ice or bag of vegetables in a dry cloth before applying to protect from frostbite.

, Allow time for the testicles to naturally heal by avoiding activities that could aggravate the pain and swelling. Avoid heavy lifting, running and other vigorous exercises.


If total rest is not possible, then wearing supportive undergarments and/or a truss can be beneficial."

Try fish oil.,
Consider curcumin.,
Use cat's claw.,
Take feverfew.,
Try Tripterygium wilfordii hook F (TWH).",How to Treat Rheumatoid Arthritis Naturally1," Some people have luck with taking fish oil supplements, particularly those with EPA and DHA, which are omega-3 fatty acids. The idea is that the Western diet is low in omega-3 fatty acids. These acids may have anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, a supplement may help with tenderness and stiffness, particularly in the morning.However, take fish oil with caution, as it can decrease your blood's ability to clot.
You can also increase your intake of these acids from natural sources, such as flax seed and algae.
Some evidence shows GLA (another omega-3 fatty acid) may also be helpful.Borage, evening primrose, and black currant seeds all contain GLA, which you can take in a supplement form. However, be aware that these can interact with other medications you may be on. For instance, evening primrose may interact with psychiatric drugs, while borage can increase your risk of liver damage.Try 2.8 grams a day of borage oil, 10.5 grams a day of black currant seed oil, or 6 grams a day of evening primrose.;
, Curcumin is found in the spice tumeric, but you can also take it as a supplement. It is said to be anti-inflammatory. Some people who take a supplement of curcumin find they have less swelling and stiffness. Some also find they can walk farther.Try 1200 milligrams a day of curcumin.

, Cat's claw, also known as uncaria tomentosa, can help with inflammation. In fact, there is some evidence it works like prescription rheumatoid arthritis drugs. Some people who take this supplement notice less joint swelling. It may also help with the pain.You can take 250 milligrams to 350 milligrams daily.You shouldn't take cat's claw if you have low blood pressure, leukemia, kidney or liver disease, or if you're on a blood-thinning medication., Some patients with rheumatoid arthritis take a supplement of feverfew. They believe it helps with grip strength. You can take this supplement in powder form, as much as 70 to 86 milligrams of the powder daily., This supplement has been used in China for hundreds of years to treat joint pain. It also may help with stiffness, grip strength, and swelling. You can take 60 milligrams a day. Most people begin to see results within a month."

You need to add lumbar chair supports to all of your seats, including your car. You can use a seat wedge, a small pillow, or a rolled up towel positioned at your lower back., A natural way to relieve the pain and promote healing is by using an infrared heating pad on the affected area. These heating pads use infrared rays that go into your tissues and bones to improve circulation and promote healing.A typical session with an infrared heating pad is 30 minutes, followed by a rest period then a gentle massage. You can also do 30 minutes on one spot, then move the heating pad to a different place for 30 minutes at that angle. You can do this multiple times each day.
You can purchase these heating pads online or at drug stores.

, You can use your glutes, aka your buttock muscles, to support your spine and reduce nerve pain. Before you bend over or stand up when seated, squeeze your glutes. This helps stabilize your back and lessen abnormal movements that may cause more pain on your trapped nerve., If your trapped nerve is making it difficult to sleep, put a pillow between your knees when you’re going to sleep. Lie on your side with the pillow resting between your knees. You should be able to find the neutral pelvic position which will reduce the pain."

Try the 90/90 position.,
Stretch your core area.,
Stretch the hamstrings.,
Perform lower back stretches.",How to Untrap a Nerve in Your Lower Back3," This position can give relief to your lower back. Lie on the floor with a pillow supporting your head. If you need to, use a lumbar support cushion under your back. Lift your calves and place them on a chair or sofa. Make sure you hips and knees are bent at a 90 degree angle.You can stay in this position for as long as you feel comfortable, but make sure to try for at least 30 to 60 seconds.
This position should not cause you any pain.

, Stretching some of the muscles around your back can help untrap the nerve and relieve pain. Start with a core stretch. Sit down with your legs straight out in front of you. Twist your core as you place your hand on the opposite knee. Lean forward to stretch your back muscles as you twist. Hold for around five seconds, then stretch the other side.Stretch your sides by standing and leaning to one side to gently stretch out those muscles. Hold for a few seconds, and then stretch the opposite side. Go back and forth five to six times.

, Hamstring stretches can also help with back pain. Sit with your legs out. Lean forward, folding your body over your legs, and touch your toes. If you can’t touch your toes, touch your ankles, shoes, or any other part you can. Hold for a few seconds, then straighten and repeat.Lie flat on your back with a pillow under your head. Bend your knees. Bring one knee towards your chest. Grab the hamstring, or the back of the leg, with both of your hands. Straighten the knee as much as you can slowly and pull your leg towards you. Hold for around 30 seconds. Bend the knee, then return to start.

, Stretching your lower back can help with trapped nerves. Lie down on your back with a pillow under your head, and bend your knees. Bring one knee up towards your chest.

NSAIDs like ibuprofen and aspirin can help reduce swelling and help with pain.Make sure to read the instructions and follow them carefully.

, You may choose to use a pain-relieving cream or ointment on the area of your back that is hurting. Spread the cream over the sore spot and wait a few minutes for it to start working.Read the instructions and follow them carefully.
You can get these creams at supercenters, supermarkets, or drug stores.

, If you think you have a trapped nerve in your back, you should consider seeing a chiropractor. They will give you a physical exam, evaluate your symptoms, and determine the cause of your pain., Your doctor may prescribe you medication as the first treatment for a trapped nerve. You will be prescribed anti-inflammatory drugs, which may include steroids. You may also be prescribed painkillers like opioids. These pain relievers often help reduce pain associated with a trapped nerve.You may also be prescribed muscle relaxants or anticonvulsants. You may also get spinal injections of pain relievers.

, If your pain doesn’t go away, you can try physical therapy. A physical therapist can give you specific stretches and exercises that will help heal and untrap the nerve in your back. You can perform certain exercises with the aid of a physical therapist that you cannot do on your own., If your trapped nerve doesn’t improve, they may decide to do surgery. They will try to do the surgery that is the least invasive possible. Discuss with your doctor which procedure is best for your particular case.In one surgery, they shave off part of the bone to create an opening for the nerve, which untraps it. Another surgery will completely remove the bone, and another can remove the disc that traps the nerve.
The benefits of the surgery may include reduced pain and increased mobility.
Most back nerve surgeries are minimally invasive and you can go home the same day. As with any surgery involving the nerves, there are risks for neurological damage that can generally be immediately detected.

Try to get a medical referral.,
Make an appointment.,
Discuss a plan before you start.",How to Use Massage for Neck Pain2," You might be able to get massage therapy through a medical referral. This is sort of like your doctor “prescribing” massage as a treatment and sending you to see a specialist. It will also make it more likely that your insurance will cover the massage. Talk to your doctor about a possible referral.Discuss your neck pain and ask if the doctor would advise massage. If she agrees, ask for a referral. In one study in Australia, about ¾ of doctors reported referring patients to a massage therapist at least once per year.
Keep in mind that, even with a referral, your insurance might not cover the treatment. While most physical therapy and chiropractic treatments are covered, about 90% of patients pay out of pocket for massage therapy.

, Massage therapy is performed by professionally trained and certified therapists and is different from a normal, relaxing massage. Namely, it will be more intense. Sessions usually last 50–60 minutes and can at least temporarily reduce pain and depression, increase range of motion, and minimize muscle tenderness.Call to book an appointment with a certified massage therapist. To find one in your area, ask your doctor or try the American Massage Therapy Association’s (AMTA) website.
Some chiropractor and physical therapy offices also offer massage therapy. Ask there, too.

, There are over 80 different kinds of therapeutic massage available, several of which might work for you. Talk with the therapist to decide on a plan of action. When you book your appointment, describe the pain and indicate that you’d like your neck worked on. He can then tailor the massage for your needs.Be specific about what the underlying problem is. Is your neck pain due to arthritis, for example? Perhaps it is whiplash from a car accident or a repetitive stress injury from work? These may have an effect on the strategy used.
Ask the therapist what techniques and treatments he will use and what they should normally feel like. You will want to know what to expect.
Discuss any other health problems you have. Massage therapy isn’t advisable for people with conditions like blood clots, osteoporosis, or hemophilia.

Book a normal massage.,
Try a Thai massage.,
Look into Tui Na massage.,
Find someone trained in trigger point massage.",How to Use Massage for Neck Pain3," Classic (or Swedish) massage is a gentle form of massage that relies on kneading, stretching, and rolling the muscles in the direction that the blood flows to the heart to help relax you. It is often done with oil to reduce friction. Try this approach for your aching neck.You can easily book a classic massage. Try at nearby spas, health clubs, or gyms. Beware of so-called “massage parlors,” however, as many are fronts for prostitution. If you are in the United States, look for someone who is certified by your state’s regulatory board.
Tell the masseur or masseuse that you’d like them to focus on your neck and/or back.

, An alternative to classic massage is the Thai method. Thai massage may be helpful for painful back or neck pain. It differs from classic massage in that it doesn’t use oil and pulls, stretches, and compresses muscles rather than kneading them. This type of massage can be more rigorous than others — some people liken it to yoga.Ask at local spas and health clubs if they offer Thai massages. You can also search on the AMTA’s website.
Make sure that the masseur is qualified to give Thai massage. This technique’s intensity can cause injuries if done improperly.
Also be sure that the masseur knows about any health conditions you have, like high blood pressure, heart disease, skin problems, or diabetes.

, Tui Na is a Chinese form of massage that uses the idea of acupressure and the manipulation of pressure points to relieve pain around the body. Some people think that it can help with neck pain and that the compression of these points brings balance in the body’s Qi.Expect a session of about 30 to 60 minutes. The technique will resemble a classic massage in some ways — rolling, kneading, gliding, and pressing the muscles in your neck.
However, in Tui Na the masseur will apply pressure to certain points alongside massage, the idea being to re-establish proper energy flow.
Some people think that this technique can improve neck pain, but also pain in the shoulders, back, legs, arms, and elsewhere. Your masseuse may ask you to try Chinese medical herbs, as well.

, If you find that treating your trigger points provides some relief, you may want to consider seeing a trigger point therapist for a full professional session.

Have lab tests done.",How to Treat Pain and Swelling in the Testicles2," There are some common risk factors for both bacteria and viral infections that cause testicular pain. These risk factors include:Sexual activity
Strenuous physical activity, such as frequent bicycle or motorcycle riding
Prolonged sitting, such as frequent travel or truck driving
History of prostate or urinary tract infection
Benign enlarged prostate or prostate surgery, typical in older men
Anatomic defects such as a posterior urethral meatus, which occur in prepubescent boys

, Testicular pain from trauma, called testicular torsion, includes pain of the testicles and of the epididymis, which is the tube that runs on the underside of the testicles. To evaluate this, it requires a meticulous physical exam. If you have experienced any testicular trauma at all, especially testicular torsion caused by a twisting of the testicles, have it checked because it is a testicle-threatening problem.


Your doctor may check your Cremasteric reflex, which is absent in cases of trauma. This is done by running a reflex hammer along the inner thigh, which will cause the testicle to rise up protectively into the scrotal sac in healthy testicles.Testicular torsion usually represents itself as an abrupt pain.

, Age plays a major factor in the determination of infection. Infectious causes of testicular pain include bacterial infection of the testicles and epididymis. This is due to bacteria that make their way up from the rectum, usually in men older than 35 and younger than 14. For young men between 15 and 35, the most common reason for infections of the testicles are sexually transmitted bacteria, such as Chlamydia and Gonorrhea.You will have pain when the area is touched during examination. Your doctor may check to see if elevating the testicles will ease your pain, which is referred to as Prehn’s sign.Treatment of the infection will help with pain relief and combat any worsening of the infection and potential sepsis.
The Cremasteric reflex will still occur with pain due to infections.

, Orchitis is due to viral infection, which causes pain and swelling in the testicle to come on abruptly. There is acute pain and swelling of the testicle. Orchitis occurs due to mumps orchitis, a viral infection seen with more prevalence as we see a lack of the MMR vaccine being given in early childhood, around 11 months. Approximately 20 to 30 % of kids with mumps will get mumps orchitis.It usually begins one week after the onset of parotitis, which is the swelling of the parotid glands beneath the jaw.


There is no treatment for viral mumps orchitis and it may cause infertility. The only way to help is with supportive care, such as pain medications and ice packs.

, For STIs, the symptoms will likely be pain in the testicles, which may be accompanied by burning during urination. The onset of the symptoms is gradual and can take weeks for them to show up. The testicular pain may also be associated with nausea and vomiting as well as abdominal pain. You will have a normal Cremasteric reflex.


An ultrasound will show increased vascularity, pockets of infection, or abscess formations.
You may also suffer from other symptoms, such as discharge or blood in the urine., The pain caused by this bacterial infection develop quickly, over a day or so. Your epididymis and testicles will swell rapidly and become enlarged, red, and tender. It will also cause great pain.


You may also have a different infection, such as a urinary tract infection or urethral infection.

, Lab tests are helpful in detecting infection. Your doctor may test your urine for bacteria, such as E coli. If you are a sexually active young man, your doctor may run a urine multiplex polymerase chain reaction (M-PCR), which will show if you have chlamydia or gonorrhea.An ultrasound is routinely performed for all scrotal pain and swelling, in order to check for more complicated problems.

Deal with bacterial infections.,
Treat sexually transmitted infections.,
Deal with testicular trauma.",How to Treat Pain and Swelling in the Testicles3," Men of any age can suffer from infections that cause testicle pain, which can be caused by E. Coli or other bacteria. For older men, benign enlarged prostates can play a major role in developing these infections. The bacteria accumulates when the enlarged prostate prevents the bladder from draining properly. Because of this, E.coli or other gastrointestinal bacterial can back up and cause infection.


Medical treatment for this includes Bactrim DS or a quinolone antibiotic. The course of treatment is around 10 days, unless the prostate is involved, which may be treated longer.
Often, the Prehn’s sign will ease symptoms. Ice packs are also helpful.
You can reduce pain with Tylenol, Motrin, or even stronger narcotic pain medication for the first few days., Treatment for STIs is antibiotics. Your doctor may prescribe Rocephin followed by a course of zithromax or doxycycline. Improvement in pain should begin in 24 to 48 hours. Ice packs as well as testicular elevation can bring relief while you wait for the antibiotics to work. You can also take over the counter pain medications to help as well, especially during the first few days., Testicular trauma is caused by a twisted testicle not getting enough blood. This typically occurs after many different kinds of trauma, such as slipping off of a bicycle and hitting the groin. Extreme testicular trauma can twist the spermatic cord, which calls for surgical intervention. This condition affects 3.8% of every 100,000 males under the age of 18 every year.


Early recognition of a high-riding testicle and no Cremasteric reflex is sufficient to warrant surgical exploration. This can help prevent an orchiectomy, which is the surgical removal of the testicle.
Even trauma that is not severe can cause swelling, tenderness, high fevers, and frequent and urgent need to urinate.
The window from injury to surgery is approximately four to eight hours. This will prevent too much damage to the spermatic cord, which has to be untwisted quickly to avoid removal. Despite this rush to take care of it, orchiectomy rates average 42%. Delay in diagnosis may result in orchiectomy and possibly infertility."

Try capsaicin cream.,
Consider acupuncture.,
Give magnetic treatments a try.",How to Treat Rheumatoid Arthritis Naturally2," Capsaicin is the ingredient in peppers that makes them hot. When used in a topical cream, it may have a slight warming effect. However, it can also help decrease pain related to arthritis. Just apply the cream in the areas where you have pain.Try a cream that's 0.025% capsaicin.

, While studies disagree about whether acupuncture is effective for rheumatoid arthritis, some people do have good luck. Find a reputable acupuncturist in your area to see if they believe they can help you with your arthritis., Some rheumatoid arthritis sufferers have luck using magnets to treat pain from the disease. The idea is that you wear a magnet near your skin, which in turn helps with the arthritis. For instance, you can purchase magnetic bracelets online.However, some studies show magnetic bracelets (and copper bracelets) do not work better than a placebo."

Try a healthier diet.,
Decrease stress.,
Use hydrotherapy.,
Do yoga or t'ai chi.",How to Treat Rheumatoid Arthritis Naturally3," Eating a healthy, well-balanced diet can help you keep your rheumatoid arthritis in check. A well-balanced diet, including lean proteins, whole grains, dairy, fruits, and vegetables will give you the nutrition you need to stay healthy.Some patients have luck eliminating some foods to reduce inflammation. For instance, cutting back on sugar, saturated fats, trans fats, omega-6 fatty acids, refined carbs, MSG, and alcohol may be beneficial. Cutting gluten (in bread) and casein (in dairy) back may also help. Aspartame, as well, can cause inflammation in some people.Following a vegetarian/vegan diet or a Mediterranean diet has been beneficial for some.

, Some studies have shown that stress and worrying can increase your chances of a flare-up of arthritis. Therefore, decreasing the stress in your life may help you lessen the effects of rheumatoid arthritis on your body.Deal with stress as it comes. In the moment when you're feeling anxious, remind yourself that what you're experiencing will soon pass, both the situation and the emotion behind it. Just reminding yourself of that fact can help calm you down.Try deep breathing. When you're feeling stressed, take a moment to breathe deeply. Close your eyes, and breathe in to the count of four. Make sure you are breathing from your diaphragm. Hold your breath for four counts, then breathe out to the count of four. Keep breathing until you feel yourself calm down.
Don't forget to get the sleep you need. Get a full night's sleep (7-9 hours) can help you deal with stress better.
Try incorporating more physical activity into your life. It can help both your stress and your arthritis more directly., Hydrotherapy means doing special therapy exercises in water, usually in warmer water. Typically, you do hydrotherapy with a trained physiotherapist, who will guide you through slow, steady exercises. Some people find the movements help with rheumatoid arthritis.Some people add spa therapy to their hydrotherapy, meaning they use water that has salts and minerals. This treatment is especially common in Europe.

, Other people have good luck using exercise programs like t'ai chi and yoga. T'ai chi is a slow-moving exercise that works on improving strength and flexibility. It may help with swelling and fatigue. Yoga also helps improve flexibility and strength in general. It helps with grip strength and may help with swelling.Try to find local t'ai chi and yoga classes in your area. You can find them through your parks and rec department, local studios, or even places like the YMCA.

Rest and give it a few days.,
Do some light stretching.,
Consider changing your sleep position.,
Apply ice to an acutely painful neck or back.,
Apply moist heat to a chronically painful neck or back.,
Use herbal remedies for pain and inflammation.,
Get a professional massage.,
Make an appointment with a chiropractor or osteopath.,
Try acupuncture treatments.,
Look into trigger point therapy.,
Consider relaxation therapies or activities.",How to Treat Neck and Back Pain Naturally," Most back and neck pain occurs when you lift too much weight, perform repetitive movements too often, move awkwardly or experience a trauma (such as a slip and fall, car accident or sports injury).However, sometimes spinal pain develops by spending too much time on the computer or sleeping in an awkward position — it can often be difficult to understand or predict the cause because the human spine is very complex with lots of moving parts.


As soon as you feel the neck or back pain, stop doing the activity that seemingly caused it and rest. Usually two to three days is enough time for most cases of mild-to-moderate spinal back to heal or feel a lot better.
If it has been over a week and your neck or back strain hasn't healed, then it's an indication of a more serious injury that likely needs professional help.
Although resting is generally beneficial for most musculoskeletal injuries, complete inactivity (such as total bed rest) can make your problem worse.
Some movement, such as taking a slow walk or doing light household chores, increases circulation and helps muscles and joints heal faster. Getting up and slowly moving around every hour, even for a few minutes, will help you heal faster.;
, Whatever is causing your neck/back pain, chances are that the muscles are guarding, which means they're tight and restricting movement. Thus, as long as you don't feel sharp, electric or stabbing pain with movement (which may indicate a disc herniation or broken bone), then lightly stretching the tender area is likely of benefit. Sore and tight muscles respond well to stretching because it reduces tension and improves flexibility or range of motion.Doing some stretching and specific movements during or after a warm shower is helpful because the muscles will be warmed up.
Good movements to start with for your neck area include shoulder rolls and circular movements with your head. If you feel pain when you are moving, stop the movement, or only go as far as you can where you feel no pain. Progress to neck rotations (looking side to side) and flexion/extensions (looking up and down).
Spend a few minutes on each set of movements three times per day.
Once your neck is warmed up, start stretching by laterally bending your neck — as if you're trying to bring your ear closer to your shoulder. Do both sides.
Then flex your neck forward (chin to chest) and slightly rotate it to the side until you're staring down at your foot. Hold for 30 seconds, then switch and do the other side.
For your back, lay on a padded surface and bring your knees to your chest. Hug your shins until you feel a stretch in your low back and hold it for 30 seconds. Try this three to five times daily.
While laying on your back, keep your knees together and rotate them to the side, so your thigh is flat against the floor. After about 30 seconds, rotate your legs to the other side.

, Although everyone reacts a little differently, some sleeping positions are much more likely to cause pain than others. For example, stomach sleeping is a common cause of neck and back pain — the neck tends to get twisted to one side and the low back can get hyper-extended and irritated. The best sleeping position for your entire spine is either on your back or sides (similar to the classic fetal position)Stomach sleeping is a difficult habit to break for most, but the benefits to your spine are worth the effort to switch positions.
When sleeping on your back, don't prop your head up with more than one pillow as it can lead to neck tension and pain.
While on your back, place a small pillow underneath your knees to take the pressure off your low back.
While sleeping on your side, use a pillow that is no thicker than the distance from the tip of your shoulder to your ear. Really thick pillows cause too much lateral flexion in the neck.
Buy a special orthopedic pillow — they are designed to support the normal curves of your neck and prevent any tension while you sleep.

, If your sore neck / back developed recently and feels inflamed and stiff, then place a bag of crushed ice (or something cold) on the most tender part in order to reduce inflammation and numb the pain.Cold therapy is most effective for acute (recent) injuries that involve swelling because it reduces blood flow by constricting local blood vessels. Apply the crushed ice for about 15 minutes three to five times daily until the soreness in your neck / back subsides or fades away.


Compress crushed ice against the sorest part of your neck / back with a stretchy Tensor or Ace bandage as it's even more helpful for limiting inflammation and swelling.
Always wrap ice in a thin cloth before you apply it to your neck or back — it helps to prevent skin irritation and frostbite.
If you don't have any crushed ice, then use ice cubes, frozen gel packs or a bag of frozen vegetables instead — peas or corn are convenient.

, If your tender neck / back has been bothering you for many weeks, then it's considered a chronic injury. Avoid cold therapy for chronic injuries and use some source of moist heat instead. Moist heat warms up muscles and other tissues by relaxing local blood vessels and increasing blood flow (which contains oxygen and nutrients). It can be helpful for soreness caused by old sports injuries or arthritis.A good source of moist heat is small microwavable bags filled with grains (bulgur wheat or rice), herbs and/or essential oils.


Heat the herbal bag in your microwave for about 2 minutes and then apply it to your painful neck / back muscles for about 15 minutes first thing in the morning or before exercise.
Add lavender or other soothing essential oils to your herbal bag as it helps reduce discomfort by relaxing you. Some herbal bags come scented with essential oils.
Taking a warm bath is another good source of moist heat. Add a cup or two of Epsom salt to your bath water for even better results — its high magnesium content relaxes and soothes tight muscles and tendons.Avoid applying dry (electrical) heat from regular heating pads to neck and back injuries because it can dehydrate your muscles and increase the risk of injury.

, If you are trying to avoid using medications for your neck or back pain, then consider herbal remedies to help ease your discomfort while your body heals. Creams, lotions and/or ointments containing menthol, peppermint, camphor, arnica, capsaicin or lavender can be helpful for relieving musculoskeletal pain, although results can vary depending on the strength of the product and how it's made. Rub some into your neck or back three to five times daily and see if the pain or inflammation is reduced.


Some herbal products are best taken by mouth instead. For example, capsules of devil's claw can be effective for reducing pain and inflammation in the neck caused by minor injuries and osteoarthritis.Capsules of turmeric root also help with pain and inflammation — they perform as well as ibuprofen and diclofenac pills in studies, but without the side effects.As a general guideline, achy pain is usually indicative of a muscle pull (strain) or tightness, whereas sharp pain with movement is often caused by joint / ligament injuries (sprains).

, Virtually all spinal pain involves the muscles to some extent, so addressing the tight or spasming muscles is a good strategy for naturally relieving neck or back pain if your budget can afford it. A deep tissue massage is helpful for mild-to-moderate strains because it reduces muscle spasm and inflammation while promoting relaxation.Start with a 30 minute massage, focusing on where you feel the majority of your neck or back pain. Allow the massage therapist to go as deep as you can tolerate it without wincing.


Neck massages should also include some attention to your upper shoulders and base of your skull.
Low back massages should include work on your hips and upper buttocks.
A single massage may really help with your neck or back pain, but sometimes a few sessions are required, depending on the cause of your problem.
Thirty-minute massages can be effective for acute pain, but longer massages (one hour) are often needed to break the ""cycle of chronicity.""
Always drink lots of purified water after a deep tissue massage in order to flush out inflammatory by-products and lactic acid from your body. Not doing so might trigger a headache or stiffness the next day.

, Chiropractors and osteopaths are spinal specialists who focus on establishing normal movement and function within the joints that connect the vertebrae of your spine.They can examine your spine and try to determine the cause of your pain — whether it's more muscle related or more joint related. Manual joint manipulation, also called a spinal adjustment, is used to naturally reposition joints in your neck / back that are a little jammed or misaligned, which triggers inflammation and sharp pain with movement.


Chiropractors and osteopaths usually take spinal x-rays to better understand your condition and to make sure an adjustment is appropriate and safe.
Although a single adjustment can sometimes relieve neck / back pain, more than likely it will take three to five treatments to notice significant results.
Chiropractors and osteopaths use a variety of other therapies for neck / back pain including massage, inversions / distraction tables, ultrasound treatments and electrical modalities (such as TENS machines) that help with musculoskeletal pain.
Your health insurance may not cover chiropractic care, so check your policy beforehand.

, Acupuncture involves inserting thin needles into specific points within your skin in efforts to reduce pain and inflammation.Acupuncture for neck and back pain can be very effective, especially if it's done when your symptoms first occur. Based on the ancient principles of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture works by triggering your body to release helpful substances, including endorphins and serotonin, which reduce pain and inflammation. Acupuncture has a very good safety record and is relatively affordable, so it's worth trying for your spinal pain if other natural treatments don't work.


There is mixed evidence to support if acupuncture is helpful in relieving chronic neck and back pain, but there's numerous anecdotal reports that suggest it's a good potential option.The acupuncture points used to reduce your neck or back pain may not be located near where you feel the pain — some points can be in distant parts of your body, such as your hand.
Acupuncture is now practiced by numerous healthcare professionals including some physicians, chiropractors, physiotherapists and massage therapists — whoever you choose should be certified by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine., Muscle knots, or trigger points, can sometimes be responsible for up to 30% of all pain.These are tender areas in the neck and pain that can produce local pain, or pain that extends to other areas (a headache, for instance, may be caused by a knot in the shoulder or neck). Applying pressure to these muscle knots for several seconds is an effective way to treat them.Chiropractors, physical therapists, massage therapists and even medical doctors may be trained in trigger point therapy.
Treatment can be done at home with a tennis ball. Place the ball under your back or neck and roll around until you find a tender spot. Hold that position for several seconds or until the pain reduces. Then move on to another spot.

, Stress-relieving practices such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, biofeedback, positive visualization and tai chi have been found to help alleviate a wide variety of musculoskeletal pain and even help prevent injuries in many people. Yoga is also great for relaxation and involves practicing specific postures or poses along with doing helpful breathing exercises.Yoga positions tend to stretch and strengthen muscles and improve posture, although you might need to modify some of the poses if they seem to aggravate your neck or back pain.
Ask at your health clinic, community center, church or gym about signing up for yoga of other helpful classes.
Alternative health care practitioners such as massage therapists, chiropractors and acupuncturists tend to be good sources of information about ""mind-body"" therapies such as those mentioned above.

Know when to see a doctor (such as a Doctor of Medicine (MD) or a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO).,
Apply heat and cold.,
Take anti-inflammatory medicine.",How to Treat Neck Pain1," It's important that you first rule out the need to immediately see a doctor. Usually neck pain is due to tension or strain in the muscles, but you should seek attention right away if:


The pain is accompanied by any numbness.
You experience any accompanying numbness in the hands or arms.
You have a shooting pain into your shoulder and down your arm.;
, Neck pain that is not caused by a serious injury can oftentimes be treated at home by applying soothing warmth and anti-inflammatory cold.Holding a heating pad or a bottle of heated water on the affected area for 15-20 minutes at a time can help relax the neck muscles, easing tension and pain, as well as increasing the blood flow and providing plenty of nutrients to the muscles, aiding the healing process. Moist heat such as a hot shower can help, and some people find it useful to apply constant low heat with store brand heat wraps.Alternate with cold. Use an ice pack for 15-20 minutes at a time. The cold helps decrease the inflammation in muscles caused by injury or strain, and can help lessen the pain. , Use ibuprofen or acetaminophen to temporarily lessen the pain, always following correct dosage. These medications help decrease inflammation of the muscles temporarily. However, over the counter medications should only be used as temporary solutions, not daily remedies.


Overuse of over the counter pain medications can lead to liver or other organ damage.Regular or everyday use of over the counter pain medications can lead to Medication Overuse Headache (MOH). This occurs when a person regularly takes medications that they don't need as a preventative rather than responsive measure, and can lead to an increase in pain, or dependence on medications."

Avoid putting unnecessary pressure on your jaw.,
Perform jaw exercises.",How to Treat TMJ Pain1," Eating soft foods that do not need to be chewed extensively may help with TMJ pain. This helps lessen the use and stress put on the joint. Some soft, easily chewable foods include:Rice
Eggs
Thinly cut and small pieces of poultry
Soups
Stews
Cooked vegetables
Soft fruit;
, Placing ice on the TMJ joint can help to reduce inflammation. It also helps reduce pain and start the healing process. Apply the ice pack for five to 10 minutes every couple of hours.Don't use an ice pack for more than 15 minutes at a time.
Make sure not to put the ice pack directly onto your skin. Wrap it in a cloth to protect your skin.
You can use a bag of frozen vegetables in place of an ice pack. Frozen peas may work well.

, Using a heat pack on your jaw may help reduce pain and improve usage of the joint. You can try a heat pack, a cloth soaked in hot water, or a hot water bottle wrapped in a moist warm cloth.Be careful to avoid burning your face. Make sure the cloth isn't so hot as to cause additional pain or damage to the skin.

, When you have TMJ pain, you should try to reduce the amount of stress on the join. Avoid any sort of extreme jaw movements, such as wide yawns and chewing gum.You should also refrain from chewing gum, resting your jaw in your hands, and sleeping face down.
Try to sleep on your side to prevent any strain on the jaw or neck muscles., Jaw exercises can help increase jaw movement. Jaw exercises focus on gentle jaw stretching and relaxing. Talk to your physician, dentist, or physical therapist for recommendations about jaw exercises. If any of these exercises cause any pain, stop and apply an ice pack. Try again later, but allow only smaller movements.Slowly open and close your mouth, straight up and down. Do not do this exercise if it makes the pain worse. Do the exercise twice a day for about five minutes.
Slowly allow your jaw to relax. Focus on letting your jaw relax for five to 10 seconds, and then slowly bring your jaw back. The idea is to actively practice letting your jaw relax.
Start with your teeth gently together and bring the tip of your tongue to your teeth. Then, bring the tip of your tongue back along the roof of your mouth until you reach the soft palate. Carefully and slowly, open your mouth, keeping the tip of your tongue on the soft palate. Stop opening your mouth as soon as your tongue begins to be pulled away from the soft palate. If you feel any pain before the tip of the tongue leaves the soft palate, stop.
Keep your tongue on the roof of your mouth. Make a loose O with your lips. Put one index finger on your TMJ and the other index finger on your chin. Allow your lower jaw to partially drop down and bring it back using the index finger on your chin. Make sure you are dropping the jaw straight down and then up. You can also do this exercise with an index finger on each TMJ. Repeat six times, five to six times a day."

Examine your everyday habits.,
Work towards having better posture.,
Work and stretch your muscles.,
Reduce strain at work.,
Reduce stress.,
Go to a yoga class.,
Adjust your sleeping habits.",How to Treat Neck Pain2," When looking into neck pain, one of the first things doctors will examine is your lifestyle and everyday habits.


Issues with posture, stress, sleeping habits, or balance can lead to neck and other body pain. Look at when your neck hurts the most. Make a list of things you do everyday-sleeping, sitting, working-and look for things you do that may be major contributors to your pain.

, Having a good posture keeps your spine properly aligned and takes pressure off of your neck.


Use your core muscles to hold up your spine and neck when you stand or sit.
Avoid releasing the abdominal muscles and ""collapsing"" the spine. This will take significant strain off the spine and neck muscles.

, Increasing the strength and flexibility of your core and neck muscles can make them more able to deal with strain.


Try some light exercises, such as smooth, slow shoulder rolls. This can help release tension in the upper shoulders and neck.
Stretch daily. Stretch your neck by slowly tilting your head towards your shoulder to one side, holding for twenty seconds, then slowly repeating on the other side. Be sure to practice smooth, slow motions-quick jerks can result in strained or torn ligaments and tendons.

,


If you spend a lot of time on the phone, switch to speaker-especially if you are in the habit of holding the phone between your head and shoulder. This posture can put a lot of repetitive strain on the neck.
Avoid carrying bags or heavy objects over your shoulder with a strap. This can cause strain and tension in the shoulder and neck muscles.
If you spend a lot of time at a desk, adjust your chair or computer so that the monitor is at eye level to reduce repetitive strain on the neck.
Take frequent breaks for moving and stretching. Get up, walk around, bend and touch your toes. Being sedentary for long periods of time puts lots of strain on the neck and back. .

, Stress and the tension it creates can cause a lot of pain in the neck and shoulders.


Get plenty of exercise and look at reducing stressors in your life.Take a short time each day to simply relax and breathe. Small stress reducers can help alleviate tension and pain. Even a few minutes of deep breathing or meditation can greatly reduce tension caused by stress.

, Practicing yoga or doing other daily stretching exercises can go a long way toward alleviating the aches and pains brought on by daily strain and stress.


Simple yoga poses focused on relaxation and spine movement are great for reducing physical strain as well as stress.Find a reliable yoga website for some easy poses that can help with neck pain and tension. , Sleeping in awkward positions can lead to neck pain. Examine how you sleep to determine if a change is needed.


Be sure that your body is aligned with your head and neck.
Use a small pillow under your head to avoid over-elevation and curvature of the neck.
Try sleeping on your back using small pillows under your thighs to help elevate your spine. Use a cervical pillow to support your neck and head. Cervical, or orthopedic pillows have contours that keep the neck supported and the head in alignment with the spine."

See your doctor.,
See an osteopathic physician.,
Be prepared for osteopathic procedures.,
Get advanced osteopathic treatment.",How to Treat Neck Pain3," Almost 60% of Americans say they probably wouldn't seek medical help if they were suffering from chronic neck pain.When the neck pain occurs due to an accident or hasn't improved after several days, seek medical attention. If you suspect an injury, you may need a physical exam and possibly an X-Ray or MRI to determine the extent of the injury. Be prepared to tell your doctor when the pain started, if it is a result of accident or injury, and what over the counter medications you've been taking for relief., Once your doctor or a general practitioner has given you initial treatment, you may be referred to a specialist like an osteopathic physician. Osteopathic physicians deal with chronic pain by considering your overall health and well being.Be open and honest about your activities so that your osteopathic physician can create an effective treatment plan. Sometimes, the seemingly small details can help your osteopathic physician determine the best course of action to alleviate physical discomfort and rid you of chronic neck pain once and for all. Talk about your habits, lifestyle, and anything that may be of relevance to your condition.
Follow the treatment plan. The success of any medical treatment and pain management hinges on your ability to follow what your osteopathic physician has prescribed. Remember, your doctor can't help you if you don't follow his or her advice! Take your doctor's opinion seriously.

, Understanding what your specialist does can alleviate concerns or worries you may have about receiving treatment, as well as make you more receptive to the benefits of osteopathic medicine.


An osteopathic physician, like a general practitioner, will ask questions about medical history, lifestyle, and overall physical conditions. Prior to a visit, have as much of your and your family's medical history at hand as possible.
An osteopathic exam will be much more extensive than a general practitioner's. A Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) will check your posture, spine, and joints, as well as examining various bones, tendons, and muscles.
OMTs (osteopathic manipulation techniques) are used by D.O.s to treat chronic pain. Akin to massage, OMT techniques involve the D.O. pushing and moving muscles, and sometimes holding a muscle in place in order to relieve tension.

, Advanced treatment may be necessary for severe chronic pain cases. D.O.s sometimes use the same musculoskeletal surgical procedures as other doctors, but evidence suggests that OMTs are usually the most effective methods. Typically, an osteopathic physician will use techniques somewhat similar to chiropractic such as gentle mobilization and spinal mobilization to work with patients in a whole body (holistic) manner."

Take over-the-counter medication.,

Make sure to follow your doctor's instructions.,
Get prescription medication.,
Use a bite guard.",How to Treat TMJ Pain2," One common treatment for TMJ pain is over-the-counter medications. You can try ibuprofen, such as Advil, naproxen, like Aleve, or acetaminophen, like Tylenol. Remember that medication is a second line,, If taking them before seeing a doctor, follow the manufacturer's recommended dosage.

, If your TMJ pain is severe enough, your doctor may prescribe medication to help relieve it. These prescriptions will be based on the underlying condition that may be causing the TMJ.Prescribed medications may include anti-inflammatory medications, pain medications, antidepressants, and muscle relaxants.
Most experts on TMJ pain recommend using the least amount of treatment for the least amount of time. Other than OTC medications, most experts will not recommend medication., Stabilization splints, also known as bite guards, can be used to help with TMJ pain. These bite guards are specially made for you through a dentist’s office. These splints should be used temporarily, though they do not change your bite.These have not been proven to benefit many people with TMJ.

Learn the causes of TMJ pain.,
Identify the symptoms of TMJ.,
See your doctor.",How to Treat TMJ Pain3," The TMJ works like a hinge, but also uses a sliding motion. The joint also has cartilage, including a small disc of cartilage that acts as a sort of shock absorber. This disc can become damaged by arthritis, injury, or infection, or the disc can be out of alignment, causing pain. TMJ pain can also be associated with a clicking sound when you chew or talk, or there may be a sensation of grinding.Some people with TMJ have other conditions, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic headache, endometriosis, fibromyalgia, bladder inflammation, irritable bowel syndrome, low back pain, sleep disorders, and painful sexual intercourse in women. It is not clear that TMJ and these other disorders are necessarily connected.
TMJ occurs in both men and women, but women tend to have more severe pain and limitation of movement than men.

, The primary symptom of TMJ is pain in the joint and in the muscles of the jaw. Other symptoms include:Pain in the neck and in the shoulders
Chronic headaches
Stiffness in the jaw muscles
Limitations in jaw movement
Locking of the jaw
Pain or pressure in the ear
Ringing in the ears
Painful clicking, popping, or grating in the jaw joint when the mouth is opening or closing
A bite that feels off or is misaligned

, If you have any of these symptoms, it is recommended that you see a medical doctor as well as a pain specialist for treatment. Some dentists specialize in TMJ disorders as well.You should be certain that other potential causes of TMJ pain are excluded first. These causes include sinus or ear infections, dental problems including tooth abscesses, various forms of chronic headache, nerve-related facial pain, bone disease, and tumors.

Consider extracorporeal shock wave therapy.",How to Treat Heel Pain With Prolotherapy," Some medical doctors may suggest and use prolotherapy to treat your heel pain. In most cases, an osteopathic physician or surgeon will administer prolotherapy.You may decide to complement tradition medical care with prolotherapy or to use it as your main treatment. You can find a practitioner by asking your doctor, family, or friends for recommendations. The American Osteopathic Association of Regenerative Medicine also has a list of prolotherapy practitioners throughout the world at http://prolotherapycollege.org/physicians/.;
, Prolotherapy is practiced worldwide and may be called different names including steroid therapy. Your doctor may choose from three types of prolotherapy to treat your heel pain. All of them stimulate your body to produce new cells that can heal your heel pain. They include:Growth factor injections, which require giving you a shot of a growth factor or complex protein to stimulate the growth of specific cells in your heel
Growth factor stimulation injections, which require giving you a shot of something, usually dextrose, that causes your body to produce growth factors
Inflammatory injections, which require giving you a shot of a substance to cause activation of the inflammatory cascade to produce growth factor

, Talk to your doctor about which type of prolotherapy is best for your case of heel pain. In every case, prolotherapy is used as a long-term treatment that stretches out over several sessions.Your doctor may even vary the prolotherapy injections depending on the location and cause of your heel pain.


Ask your doctor any questions you may have about activities you are able to do with prolotherapy. For example, your doctor may tell you to avoid jumping, running, or climbing., Once you and your doctor have decided what type of prolotherapy is best for you, you’ll need to get yourself into a comfortable spot for the injection. This can help minimize any pain or discomfort you feel during or after the injection. It may also help relax you.Lie face down on the table with your knee bent and foot in the air. Relax your body as completely as you can. Your doctor will likely hold your heel to stabilize it during the injection.

, After you’re in position and comfortable, the doctor will inject your heel with the chosen prolotherapy treatment. The needle is about two inches long. Your doctor may inject the treatment directly into your heel, at the ball of your foot, or even in the arch.Recognize that injections to the heel or ball of your foot can be quite painful. An injection into the arch may cause less discomfort.
Take a deep breath before the injection to help yourself further relax, which may also minimize pain. Let your doctor know if you are in serious pain or something doesn’t feel right.
Ask your doctor about any post-treatment instructions including pain management, acceptable types of movement, and when you should get your next injection.

, It’s normal for an hour or two after a prolotherapy injection that you feel like you’re walking on a golf ball.However, you may experience side effects that last a few days to a couple of weeks. If they last long, seek medical attention. Some side effects of prolotherapy are:Swelling
Intense pain and stiffness
Headache
Allergic reaction
Bleeding in the injection areaBruising
Infection
Nerve damage

, Over the counter pain relievers can help relieve pain and may reduce inflammation. Using one in combination with prolotherapy and other treatments may relieve your heel pain more quickly.Take ibuprofen or naproxen sodium to help relieve your heel pain. These can also reduce inflammation that causes pain.

, One of the best ways to treat your heel pain, especially after prolotherapy, is to give your heel sufficient rest. This includes staying off of your heel as much as possible and placing as little pressure on your heel as possible when walking. Your doctor may suggest a specific amount of time to rest your heel or you can wait until you don’t have any more pain. It may take as little as a month or up to six months for your heel to heal.You should also avoid activities that put stress on your heels such as running during this time.Consider low-impact sports such as swimming or bicycling if you still want to get some physical activity. These can keep you active while giving your heel a rest.
Avoid standing for long periods or walking on hard surfaces to give your heel further rest. Ask your prolotherapist if using crutches for a few days can help your heel rest. This can also help you be more mobile.

, Ice is a good way to reduce pain and inflammation in your heel.Putting an ice pack or using an ice massager on your heel for 15-20 minutes three times a day may help your heel heal faster and relieve your discomfort.Use an ice pack that you purchase or make your own with a bag of frozen peas.
Make an ice massager by filling a paper or Styrofoam cup with cool water. Freeze the water on a flat surface until it is a solid block of ice. Then roll it on your heel for 5-7 minutes., Doing a couple of simple home stretches every day can also help relieve pain and promote healing.You can hold the following stretches for 10 seconds each and work up to 20 repetitions by:Leaning forward against a wall, keeping one knee straight and lowering your heel to the ground. Bend your other knee. Lean into the wall as much as you can to stretch your heel cord and foot arch. Keep the knee fully extended on the side you’re stretching.
Lean forward onto a countertop and spread your feet apart so that one foot is in front of the other. Then flex your knees and squat. Press your heels into the ground for as long as you can. As your heels come up in the stretch, this will stretch your arch and heel cords.

, If you are having a hard time performing heel stretches at home, consider seeing a physical therapist. He or she can guide you in different exercises that strengthen your lower leg muscles, which support your ankle and heel. In addition, the therapist will show you a series of stretches for your plantar fascia and Achilles tendon.Ask the physical therapist about using athletic tape to support the bottom of your foot and reduce pain. You may also want to ask if night splints are something that may help you. Night splints will stretch your calf and the arch of your foot.

, What shoes you wear can have a big impact on heel pain. Wearing a pair of supportive shoes or a commercial orthotic can help your heel heal and reduce pain.Replace any athletic shoes before they stop cushioning and supporting your feet.
Avoid high heels and any shoes without arch support or shock absorbency.
Get yourself a heel cup or wedge, both of which can provide pain relief. You can find these at most drugstores. In most cases, custom orthotics aren’t needed for heel pain., If you have chronic heel pain that hasn’t responded to prolotherapy or home treatments, talk to your doctor about extracorporeal shock wave therapy. This treatment requires directing sound waves at the heel pain to stimulate healing. This may not be the most effective treatment for heel pain and may come with side effects such as bruising, swelling, pain, numbness, and tingling."

Ensure you are able to take care of a pet.,
Consider getting a trained therapy dog.,
Weigh the challenges of raising a puppy.,
Adopt a friendly, well-behaved dog.,
Get a cat or another small pet.",How to Use a Pet to Help You Cope with Chronic Pain1," Before considering the many benefits associated with pet ownership, it’s important to make sure you will be able to handle the responsibilities. Taking care of a pet requires a good amount of physical activity. With the types of pet that offer the most therapeutic benefits, you’ll have to feed, bathe, and bring your pet to the vet for checkups.Dogs also need substantial exercise and socialization. Especially if you do not live with someone who will be able to help with these tasks, consider your ability to meet these responsibilities.
If you determine that you may have too much pain or cannot handle a dog on your own, see the section of this article on alternative options to pet ownership.
The financial commitment is also substantial. Dogs and cats - the best types of therapeutic pets - each costs over a $1,000 for the first year you own them, and about $500 per year thereafter.;
, Since dogs are especially responsive to training and are highly capable companions, they make the best therapy pets. If owning a dog is something you’re interested in, the first decision is whether or not to get a dog that is already trained as a therapy pet. A trained therapy pet is the best option, as they will already know how to help you in certain situations.Specifically, dogs trained to be companions for people with conditions like chronic pain will know how to behave in a therapeutic environment and will be eager to develop a comforting relationship with you.
Trained therapy dogs can be especially expensive. Even paying to have a dog rescued from a shelter fully trained can cost quite a bit. Expect to invest at least a few thousand dollars in acquiring a dog that is well trained., Getting a puppy is not recommended for people suffering from chronic pain, and it may be even more difficult to raise a puppy if you have mobility issues. Raising a puppy can be especially physically taxing, as well as stressful. For example, a puppy is likely to interrupt your sleep schedule, and reduce the flexibility of your day-to-day activities. They may even make it harder to keep social and medical obligations. If you do not live with someone that can help you raise a puppy, it is better to adopt an older dog that is already trained., Temperament is often even more important than training. In fact, an aggressive or otherwise poorly-behaved dog may lead to further stress. The more friendly your dog is, the more likely it is that their company will improve your mental health.More directly, the species and personality of your dog may affect their ability to help you cope with chronic pain. If looking for companionship, opt for a breed of dog that is especially friendly, such as a lab or retriever.

, If you are unable to get a dog or simply would not favor a dog as a pet, consider getting a cat. Cats, in fact, are even more calming to be around, and can also provide many benefits of companionship. Other animals, such as birds, reptiles, and rodents may also be fun to own, but do not offer the same benefits of ownership to people with chronic pain."

Talk to your pet.,
Pet your pet.,
Teach your dog basic helpful tasks.",How to Use a Pet to Help You Cope with Chronic Pain2," If you also experience loneliness or isolation that often accompanies chronic pain, talking to a pet is a great way to improve your mood and outlook. In fact, bonding with a pet will lead to higher amounts of oxytocin, serotonin, and dopamine in your body. These will help improve your mental statement, as well as fight pain. Further, levels of cortisol are reduced by animal companionship, leading to lower levels of anxiety, stress, and depression.Simply sit with your dog or cat and talk to them. If it seems silly to do so, consider it to be a type of spoken journal-writing, which is another activity with proven therapeutic benefits.

, If you’re interested in getting a pet, you may not be thinking about talking at all. Fortunately, pet’s can also offer meaningful physical companionship. In fact, petting an animal causes your body to release endorphins, which are your body’s natural pain relievers. If you suffer from chronic pain associated with arthritis, petting a cat or dog may even help loosen stiff, painful joints.

, Aside from the beneficial therapy training that can enrich your relationships with your dog, you can also train them to help with basic tasks around the house.For instance, you can train your dog to fetch or lift items that are out of your reach.
Additionally, you can train your dog to lay next to a joint or muscle in pain, to provide warmth and relief to the site.
Always use affirmative training techniques, such as rewarding your dog for desired behavior with treats or praise and petting.

Have a pet visit you.,
Visit a therapy dog at a pain management clinic.,
Join a pet therapy program.",How to Use a Pet to Help You Cope with Chronic Pain3," Another great way of coping with chronic pain is by having someone bring their pet over when they visit. If you have friends and family members with pets, let them know their pets are welcome at your place as well. You can even offer to pet sit for folks going out of town, which can be a great way to test whether you may want to get a pet of your own after all., Many pain management clinics have pet therapy dogs that hang out on premise and provide company to visitors. You can often call ahead and schedule a session to hang out with the dog.Even 15 minutes with a dog a few times a week can have a lasting affect on your mental and physical pain resistance. Believe it or not, these sessions may even lead to a reduction in the amount of pain medication you’re currently taking.

, If there are no pain management clinics with dogs near you, you can likely find other animal-assisted therapy options in your area. Contact nursing homes, physical rehabilitation facilities, and mental health facilities to ask if they have any therapy pets. If so, ask if there is a therapy program featuring the animal that you can participate in."

Add moderate strength-training exercise to your routine.,
Balance your level of activity.,
Develop a strong support system.",How to Treat Fibromyalgia1," Acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB), and naproxen sodium (Aleve) are all examples of OTC painkillers that can help with some pain symptoms.Always follow the specific manufacturer’s instructions regarding safe daily dosages and for how long you can take the medication before discontinuing use.;
, Certain stressors in your life—such as work, family, life-changing events, or abuse—can worsen fibromyalgia symptoms.Ensure that you give yourself time to relax and decompress every day. Turn to hobbies, meditation, yoga, tai chi, deep-breathing techniques, prayer, or whatever you find most relaxing to help stop yourself from feeling overwhelmed.Avoid changing your routine completely in hopes of avoiding all stress. Those who quit work and reduce engagement in other activities tend to suffer from worse symptoms than people who try to stay active.Some studies show that gentle yoga and tai chi may be able to help reduce physical symptoms as well as stress reduction., Increased fatigue is a common symptom of fibromyalgia.Studies have also suggested that poor sleep actually worsens fibromyalgia-related pain by impairing pain-inhibition pathways.To help facilitate longer, more qualitative sleep:Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.
Relax before going to bed while avoiding bright electronic screens from TVs, phones, and computers.
Create a relaxing bedtime routine such as taking a bath or drinking a warm beverage such as milk or a caffeine-free tea.
Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol before going to bed.
Keep away from heavy meals late at night.
Maintain a comfortable, quiet, cool, and dark room.
Avoid watching the clock when you have trouble falling asleep. Instead get up and do something relaxing until you feel sleepy.
Consider seeing a sleep professional if you still have trouble sleeping soundly despite your best efforts to cultivate a healthy sleep routine., A regular routine of moderate, aerobic exercise has been shown to help with pain, function, and general quality of life for those with fibromyalgia.Most importantly, begin and progress slowly to avoid inducing flare-ups or worsening current ones.Listen to your body with regard to your routine. Start with something as simple as five to ten minutes of walking a day and progress slowly to include cardio activities you enjoy such as swimming, cycling, or dancing. Low-impact exercises are best. Remember to warm up and cool down before and after each session.Progress at your own slow pace. Even a ten percent increase in time every three to six sessions is plenty. The goal is also to feel energized rather than exhausted after exercise.Once you’ve worked into a good routine, try to participate in moderate cardio exercises three to five times per week, and always use proper technique and posture to avoid injury., Your fitness routine should also include exercise to strengthen muscles and improve joint range of motion in addition to aerobic exercises.As with cardio, begin and progress slowly while listening to the feedback your body provides.


Begin with minimal resistance. As you progress, aim to strength train two to three times a week at moderate intensity.The goal is to feel energized rather than fatigued at the end of a workout, so avoid pushing yourself too hard., With both exercise and general activity, avoid pushing yourself too hard. Attempting to cram too much activity into your good days can lead to more bad days with fibromyalgia.This balance additionally means doing your best to stay active on bad days as well. Try to mix each day with a healthy balance of activity and rest.Schedule your rest and activities at the same time in an organized manner.
Doing your best to include some activity each day, including bad days, can help you manage flares faster. Even if you are only able to walk slowly for 10 minutes every few hours, this can make a big difference.

, If you have fibromyalgia, you need support from individuals or groups that can truly empathize with your condition. Frustration and stress related to living with this often misunderstood condition do nothing to help alleviate symptoms. However, support groups for fibromyalgia are common.Look into groups in your area to help develop a circle of supporters who know what you’re going through.


Don’t exclude your friends or loved ones who naturally want to help either. Provide them with educational information about your condition and the frustrations associated with it.This will help them provide the support you need on a daily basis between group meetings.

Protect yourself from diseases if you are treating someone else.",How to Treat a Wound Created by an Impaled Object1," If the object is large or deeply embedded in the skin or muscle, removing it may cause additional damage. It may also cause the person to bleed severely. Call an ambulance for severe injuries such as:Gunshot wounds
Knife wounds
Construction accidents
Any penetrating injury
Injuries from metal or glass caused by a car accident
Injuries to an eye
Injuries that are deep and dirty;
, If you are bleeding heavily, try to prevent yourself from losing too much blood. If possible, you can do this by:Not removing the object. Doing so may cause the bleeding to increase and should be done by a doctor. Instead, you can try to reduce the bleeding by pressing around the object. Be careful not to push the object deeper inside, but to instead try to hold the edges of the wound together.
Elevating the wound above the heart. If the wound occurred on an arm or leg, lie down. Prop the arm or leg up on a pile of pillows.

, If the object is large and heavy, such as a knife or other object that may move, it needs to be kept still. If the object moves inside you, it may do additional damage. You can stabilize the object by carefully bandaging the wound.Build up a layer of support around the object using clean gauze that is rolled to increase stability. Tape across the rolled gauze in a ""log cabin"" method (horizontal lines of tape overlapping at ninety degree angles). This will give the support much needed height to increase stabilization.

, Losing a lot of blood can cause a person to go into shock. Shock can be fatal because the circulatory system fails to deliver blood and oxygen to the person’s organs.The following symptoms are signs of shock: Paleness; cold, clammy skin; fast, shallow breathing; vomiting; yawning and sighing; thirst.

Use the RICE method to relieve pain.,
Rest your leg.,
Apply ice to the tendon.,
Wrap with an elastic bandage.,
Elevate your ankle.",How to Treat Achilles Pain1," When you have pain due to an Achilles tendon injury, you can immediately use the RICE method. The RICE method can help reduce inflammation and pain, and help with healing the underlying injury. The RICE method includes:


Rest
Ice
Compression
Elevation;
, If you have an Achilles tendon injury or have pain in that area, make sure to rest your foot, ankle, and leg. Constant movement will delay healing, so rest your foot as often as you can. You should rest your leg from any physical activity that requires the use of your legs as often as you can.


The first thing you should do if you think you have injured your Achilles tendon is to stop whatever activity you are doing. Continuing the activity can cause more damage to the tendon. Take the weight off your leg and ankle as soon as possible.

, You can apply an ice pack to your the painful tendon. Applying a cold compress to the injury helps reduce blood flow, which can help relieve the pain. It may also help reduce swelling and inflammation.Apply the ice pack for 20 minutes at a time every hour during the first 24 hours of the injury.
After the first 24 hours, you can place an ice pack on the Achilles tendon four to five times throughout the day, or every two to three hours.
You can use either commercial or homemade ice packs or bags of frozen vegetables, like frozen peas. Peas are small enough to conform to the shape of your ankle easily. You can also fill an old long tube sock with rice and keep it in the freezer for when you may need it.
Never place ice directly on the skin. Always wrap it in something like a towel or cloth to protect the skin.

, You can wrap the injured ankle with an elastic compression bandage. The elastic bandage helps reduce movement so the tendon can heal. It also help to limiting the swelling and provide support to the area.


The bandage should be wrapped tightly enough to apply medium pressure, but not so tightly as to cause any bulging around the bandage or stop blood flow. If the pain gets worse with the elastic bandage, it is too tight and you should loosen it.
Start wrapping high on your ankle, above the injury.
Once the swelling has gone, you don’t need to wrap anymore.

, Elevate your ankle by keeping it raised above your heart to help reduce the swelling. You should make yourself comfortable when you elevate your leg, so try placing your ankle on a pillow. You don’t want to cause any additional pain when you set it down to elevate it.


If you can’t raise the leg very high, try to keep it parallel to the ground.
After the first few days, start moving a little bit every hour. Go slow and easy so you don’t overdo it. You can make it worse by re-injuring the Achilles tendon.

If possible, use a magnifying glass to help you see exactly how it is positioned in your skin.

, You can do this by wiping them with rubbing alcohol. The alcohol will evaporate immediately afterwards.The alcohol does not need to be washed off.

, Gently pull it out using the same path through which it entered. Pull firmly but gently.


Do not make sudden jerky movements or twist the object. Doing so will make the wound larger.
If the object is difficult to remove, soaking the site in warm saline water or water with a splash of vinegar for a few minutes can help the object to work its way to the surface.

, This will clean the area where the object was. Run the wound under clean water and gently wash it with soap.


Inspect the wound to make sure there are no foreign particles left in the wound.
Gently dry the wound. Do not scrub hard because once the wound has been cleaned, you want to allow it to close and heal.

, This will help prevent infection. These ointments (Neosporin, Polysporin) are available at local pharmacies.Cover the wound with a bandage. This will prevent dirt and bacteria from getting into the wound as it heals.
Monitor the wound for signs of infection. If the pain increases or the wound swells, becomes hot, turns red, or leaks pus, call your doctor.

Take over-the-counter pain relievers.,
Wear special footwear.,
Undergo surgery.,
Recover slowly.",How to Treat Achilles Pain2," For most Achilles tendon pain, you can treat it with over-the-counter pain relievers.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) are used for short-term (acute) pain. These include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve). NSAIDs help reduce both the pain and swelling of an injured or sore tendon.Follow your physician’s directions carefully. Also make sure to follow the manufacturer’s recommended dosage.
Long-term use of NSAIDs can lead to bleeding and ulcers., If your Achilles tendon is causing you pain, your doctor may suggest wearing special footwear. You may try shoes with softer heels to help reduce pain when you walk. You might also try putting heel lifts into your shoes.If you have a lot of pain, your doctor may suggest that you wear a walking boot for awhile. This helps take some of the stress off the Achilles tendon so it can start to heal.

, For serious injuries, surgery may be the best option. With surgery, the success rates are very high, around 80 to 90% success. Generally, surgery is only suggested for those who have had an Achilles tendon injury that doesn’t heal after approximately six months.During Achilles tendon surgery, the surgeon may lengthen your calf muscles, remove damaged parts of the tendon, remove a bone spur, anchor the tendon to the bone, or perform a tendon transfer.

, For most serious Achilles tendon injuries, recovery can take from three to six months. While it may not be easy, try not to rush back into strenuous physical activity until there is no pain. That can cause more serious and more permanent injury. For minor Achilles tendon injuries, wait until there is no pain and go easy when you start physical activity again.


You can try other exercises that won’t hurt your Achilles tendon, such as swimming, while you recover.
Make sure you stretch your calf muscles and Achilles tendon before any activity that requires running, turning quickly, or jumping.
Make certain that your shoes fit you well and are appropriate for the physical activity that you are doing.

Identify the common causes for injury.,
Learn the main injuries of the Achilles tendon.,
Recognize the symptoms of an Achilles tendon injury.,
Diagnose Achilles tendon injuries.",How to Treat Achilles Pain3," There are a number of ways that anyone, though most commonly athletes, can injure their Achilles tendon. Some of the more common activities that can lead to Achilles tendon injuries are running, gymnastics, dance, football, and baseball. The most common injuries are due to:Overuse
Increasing your physical activity either too quickly or without stretching or warming up
Wearing high heels
Foot problems, such as flat feet, also known as fallen arches, or overpronation, which is the inward rolling of the ankle, often related to flat feet
Muscles or tendons in the leg that are too tight
Heel bone spurs

, There are multiple different afflictions that can happen to the Achilles tendon. These injuries vary in severity. The main injuries associated with the Achilles tendon are:Inflammation, known as tendinitis.
Tendon rupture, which can occur anywhere but commonly in the middle of the tendon or at the heel. Midpoint ruptures are more common.
Achilles tendinosis, which is a degenerative condition of the tendon where the tendon fibers are scarred and damaged.

, Achilles tendon injuries may present with different symptoms. The main symptoms of Achilles tendon injury are pain, swelling, and tightness in the tendon.These symptoms can appear suddenly or become progressively worse over time.


You may also have pain or difficulty climbing stairs or running.
You may wake up with pain at the heel and tendon.
There may be a bump in the middle of the tendon or at the heel that may be tender to touch. #*Sometimes the pain only occurs when you are wearing higher heels.

, If you believe you have an injured Achilles tendon, you should go see your doctor. Diagnosis depends on the history of the injury and a physical examination by a doctor. Possibly some imaging test such as X-rays, MRIs or an ultrasound may be required.The calf squeeze test is a relatively straightforward test to screen for Achilles tendon rupture. A simple test for Achilles tendon injury is the Achilles tendon pinch test. The degree of soreness roughly correlates with the degree of injury.

Take it easy.,
Try ice for acute injuries.,
Use heat for chronic pain.,
Use acupuncture.,
Try acupressure.",How to Treat Musculoskeletal Pain Without Surgery1," When you first notice any musculoskeletal pain, you should take it easy and rest your sore muscles. This means abstaining from exercise, strenuous activity, or any other activity that will overwork your muscles.


Make sure you take a few days off from this kind of activity, only starting it again once the pain in your muscles have stopped.
This doesn't mean you can't walk or do light work, since moving the sore muscles a little bit may actually help your muscles.;
, When your muscle pain first starts, you can add ice to it to help reduce the pain. Ice packs help reduce inflammation and any possible swelling to the muscles. This method is generally recommended for acute injuries.


Make an icepack by putting ice in a bag or towel and holding it against the aching muscle. Make sure you don't put the ice directly against your skin because it can cause damage to your skin. Also ensure you only keep it on for about 15 to 20 minutes.
You can also use a bag of frozen vegetables or fruit if you don't have any ice.Ice may make muscle spasms or cramps worse, so if you experience them, make sure you stop using ice then.

, If your muscles have been hurting for a few days, you might want to try heat to alleviate the pain. This method is helpful for chronic pain and should only be used on musculoskeletal pain about 24 to 48 hours after the pain starts.


You can apply heat by soaking a rag in almost boiling water, using a heating pad, or buying self-heating patches.
Make sure you don't keep the heat on your muscles for too long. It can cause burning or irritation to your skin.
If your muscles or joints are swollen, the heat may make the inflammation worse. Keep in mind that heat can make inflammation feel worse and cold can make muscle spasms or cramps worse.
You can also alternate between cold and heat packs. However, if the heat makes it worse, stick to ice packs., Acupuncture is a non-invasive traditional Chinese medical treatment, where very fine needles are inserted in the specific areas that are painful. In medical studies, acupuncture has shown to relieve pain in about half of those it is administered to.


Your acupuncturist will administer these needles to the muscle areas where you are experiencing pain.
Make sure you find a licensed acupuncturist to administer this method of treatment. It cannot be done at home or on your own., If you are experiencing muscles pain, you can also try acupressure. It is an Asian Bodywork Therapy that uses finger placements and pressure along certain areas of the body to relieve pain.Depending on where your musculoskeletal pain resides, the pressure points will vary. Look into a guide to acupressure points to ensure that you apply the acupressure to the correct points.

Keeping your hands firmly on the roller, inhale as you slowly arch your upper back towards the ceiling while looking down towards your hips.
Reverse the motion as you exhale. Slowly lift your head and hips towards the ceiling.
Avoid forcing your back and neck past your range of motion, which may cause over-straining., Tight back and neck muscles often happen because of tight chest muscles. This is a result of sitting forward all day. Using your foam roller on your chest muscles can stretch them out along with your neck and back.Set the roller on the ground and lie with your chest on it.

Learn about musculoskeletal pain.,
Recognize the causes of muscle pain.,
See your doctor.,
Go to the chiropractor.",How to Treat Musculoskeletal Pain Without Surgery4," Musculoskeletal pain can sometimes be called myalgia or myopathic pain. This pain often involves more than one muscle and also typically involve tendons, joints, ligaments, and other muscle tissues such as fascia. However, it may just feel like overall muscle ache, since all of these tissues are interlinked.


Ligaments are the tough tissues that connect bone to bone and bone to cartilage.
Tendons are the tissues that attach muscles to bones or to organs, such as the eye.
Fascia are the almost transparent very thin tissue that cover muscles or organs., There are many causes of muscle pain. There are some causes that are common and frequently occurring, such as that due to tension, over-stretching, overuse, or injury. However, muscle pain may also be a symptom of some infections, such as the flu or other medical issues, including systemic disorders such as thyroid disease, fibromyalgia, Lyme disease, or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Prepare by purchasing plenty of soft food before your surgery. You'll need to have enough to last you for at least 24 hours. However, you'll probably want enough for several days while the swelling goes down. You can begin to introduce other foods when you feel that you can tolerate them. Avoid anything that could get caught in the wound until the wound is healed.


Puree things like smoothies or soups in a blender. Strain through a filter before consuming to make sure there are no seeds or herbs that will get caught in the wound.
Stay away from spicy foods. They can irritate the wound.
Choose plenty of cold foods. They'll feel soothing after the surgery.
Some foods that are great for after oral surgery are:

Yogurt (frozen or non-frozen)
Apple sauce
Brothy soups (without any chunks)
Mashed potatoes
Scrambled eggs
Hummus
Congee
Pudding
Ice cream

;
, You should not plan to drive after the surgery. Plan for a friend to take you home when the surgery is finished. Even if you don’t undergo general anesthesia, you will likely feel too woozy from the surgery to drive.If you usually take public transportation, you may not need someone to accompany you. However, you may still want a buddy. They can make sure you’re comfortable on the trip home.
Don’t plan to walk or bike home yourself. If you live a short distance from the dentist’s office, arrange for a cab or a friend to pick you up.

, You’ll need about 48 hours for the swelling to go down. However, the entire recovery can take several weeks. Plan for at least two days that you’ll be able to stay home from work. Let your boss know that you’re having surgery and you may need to take off a few additional days if your recovery is slower than average.Avoid all strenuous physical activity for a few days after the surgery. This may mean arranging for childcare or a pet sitter during your recovery.
You may need friends or family to take care of chores for a day or two. Consider whether you’ll need someone to do things like take the garbage out, water the garden, or shovel snow from your sidewalk.

, Both of these things can be purchased at your local pharmacy. Your dentist may give you a supply of gauze and a prescription for pain relievers. However, it’s always good to be prepared with your own.Buy sterilized gauze pads that are safe to put in your mouth. Ask your pharmacist for a recommendation.
Choose a pain reliever that doesn’t contain caffeine. Caffeine should be avoided while recovering from surgery.
You can also keep teabags on hand. They can help control bleeding. Soak one in warm water and then squeeze it dry. Hold it on the wound for 20-30 minutes.

, You may be resting for a while after the surgery. Create a cozy space in your home where you'll be able to rest comfortably. You should have plenty of pillows and blankets, as well as entertainment.


Take out books from the library, or download some books on tape to listen to while you recover.
Choose movies or TV shows that you'll want to watch while you're resting. Have them ready to go so you won't have to worry after the surgery.

, Recovering at home can feel boring and even lonely sometimes. Before the surgery, line up visiting times with friends and family. Let them know you'll want visitors, and schedule times when they can come by.


Let your friends know you may be a little bit out of it, but that you'll still be grateful for their company.
Don't plan to do too much with your visitors. Simply watching a movie or listening to music together are relaxing ways to enjoy each others company.

, Surgery can seem scary if you don’t know what to expect. Your dentist should be happy to explain the process to you before they begin. Ask any questions you have; this may set your mind at ease.Make sure you don’t have any infections currently. If you do, tell your dentist about them. The surgery may need to be rescheduled.

, Most wisdom tooth removals only require local anaesthetic. This means that you’ll be awake during the surgery. In some cases, your dentist may give you sedation anaesthesia or general anaesthesia.Sedation anaesthesia suppresses your consciousness. It’s delivered intravenously and will leave you with a limited memory of the surgery.
General anaesthesia may be inhaled through the nose or delivered intravenously. General anaesthesia will put you completely asleep and you’ll be unconscious throughout the procedure.
All anaesthesia carries a small degree of risk. However, when used properly, anaesthesia is considered extremely safe.

, You may experience some pressure or discomfort during the surgery, but you should not feel pain. If you do feel pain during the surgery, it means that the anaesthetic is not working. Let your dentist know immediately. If your dentist has given you only a local anaesthetic, close your eyes during the procedure. This may take your mind off the procedure somewhat.

, Keep your head somewhat elevated to help slow the bleeding. If you choose to lie down, use a few pillows to keep your head up.Keeping your head elevated may make sleeping less comfortable. However, it helps the bleeding stop.
If it’s hard to sleep with your head elevated, do something else to help you relax. You can watch TV, listen to the radio, or read a book or magazine., You don’t want to irritate the wound or spread bacteria throughout your mouth. After 24 hours, you can brush your teeth gently, avoiding the surgical wound., After 24 hours, you should begin to rinse your mouth regularly with saltwater. Do this every two hours, and after you eat. Keep this up for a week as the wound heals. You can make saltwater by dissolving 1tsp of salt in 1 8oz glass of warm water.

, Avoid sugary drinks and caffeine while recovering. Within the first 24 hours, avoid carbonated beverages and hot beverages as well.Never drink through a straw after oral surgery. This can dislodge a blood clot from the socket.

, This can be difficult if you’re a regular smoker. Tobacco use can lengthen the recovery process. It also increases the risk of complications from the surgery. If you chew tobacco, avoid doing so for at least a week after surgery.
You may want to use a nicotine patch to help curb cravings if necessary.

, Your doctor may have prescribed a specific pain reliever. If they did, take that medication as recommended. If you didn’t receive a prescription, take over-the-counter pain relievers as needed.Ask your dentist which over-the-counter pain relievers they recommend.

, In the first 24 hours, you can put an ice pack on the outside of your cheek. This will help reduce swelling and pain. After 24 hours, use damp heat on your cheek, such as a warm wash cloth.Dry heat (such as heating pads) can dehydrate the area, which is not good for healing. Always try to use a form of heat that won’t dehydrate you.
Ice and heat are best when applied for at least 15 or 20 minutes. However, you can continue applying them as much as feels good.

Keep the wound clean and dry.,
Cleanse the incision area the day after surgery.,
Change your bandage as needed.,
Watch for signs of infection.",How to Take Care of an Incision After Thyroid Surgery1," One of the most important things to do after you have had thyroid surgery is to keep the wound clean and dry. Follow your doctor’s instructions for wound care and bathing following your surgery. Doing so may help prevent your wound from becoming infected and it may also help the wound to heal faster.Do not immerse the wound in water until it is fully healed. For example, do not go swimming or submerge the wound while taking a bath.
Immediately following surgery, you may have a small drain tube exiting the skin of the neck near the thyroid incision site; it will help keep fluid from building up in your neck, fluid that could lead to infection and additional pain. Your doctor should remove the drain tube prior to your discharge from the hospital once any drainage is clear and sparse.;
, The morning after your surgery, you can take a shower and allow water and mild soap to run over your wound. Do not scrub the wound or put pressure on it with high pressure water or your fingers. Just allow some water to run over the incision site and cleanse it., Your doctor may instruct you to keep the wound covered with some light gauze held on with tape. In this case, you may need to change your bandage once per day to keep the wound clean.Be gentle when you remove the old gauze as it may stick to your skin. If it is stuck, use about a teaspoon of hydrogen peroxide or saline to moisten the gauze and make it easier to remove the bandage. Then use some cotton balls dipped in hydrogen peroxide or saline to gently clean away any dried blood on your skin before replacing the bandage., Surgical site infection in thyroid surgery is very rare as it is considered a “clean case,” with minimal chances of contamination.However, it is important to observe the wound after surgery for signs of infection and talk to your doctor right away if you notice any of these signs. Signs that a wound may be infected include:


Redness, warmth or swelling at the site.
Fever greater than 100.5°F (38°C)
Drainage or opening of the wound

Examine your nipples for signs of irritation.,
Rinse the area with water and a mild soap.,
Apply a lanolin cream to the affected area.,
Apply ice to help with pain.,
Take steps to avoid further chafing.,
Visit the doctor if the condition doesn't improve in a few days.",How to Soothe Sore Nipples1," Friction from clothes rubbing against your skin is a common cause of nipple soreness. This is common among athletes, and the condition is often nicknamed ""runner's nipple."" If this is the case, you'll probably notice the following symptoms.General pain or tenderness.
Redness.
Dryness.
Cracks or fissures.
Bleeding.;
, Like with any skin injury, an abrasion on your nipple can cause an infection. To prevent this, wash the area carefully with mild soap and warm water. Dry thoroughly after.When you dry your nipple, air drying is best. If necessary, pat it with a towel. Rubbing will increase the irritation and pain.
Using an antiseptic like alcohol will probably make the inflammation worse.

, Lanolin is a product designed to protect the skin. It moisturizes the area, soothes pain, and heals cracks and abrasions. Creams with lanolin should be available at pharmacies and supermarkets.Alternatively, you could also apply petroleum jelly to the area. This will lock in moisture and prevent the area from rubbing against your clothes., If you're in pain from the chafing, you can apply an ice pack to relieve the area.


Whether you use a commercial cold pack or a bag of ice, be sure to wrap it in a towel. Ice applied directly to the skin can cause frostbite.
Do not leave the ice on for longer than 20 minutes. This can damage the skin. If the area is still painful, allow the skin to warm up before reapplying the ice.

, Once you've treated your sore nipples, you can take steps to prevent future problems.Wear a loose-fitting shirt during athletic activities. Also wear a shirt made from synthetic material instead of cotton, since cotton can be abrasive.
Moisture-wicking materials will also keep sweat away from the area and help prevent chafing.
Women should make sure to wear a sports bra that fits properly. A loose-fitting bra will allow too much movement and cause the nipples to rub against the bra.
Apply Vaseline or petroleum jelly to your nipples. This will help protect the area and prevent chafing.
Cover your nipples with a specialized product like NipGuard. Alternatively you could use a band aid to cover your nipples, but removal may be painful, especially if you have hair on your chest.

, With proper care, nipple abrasions should clear up in a few days. If the area doesn't heal, you should consult your doctor. There may be another condition causing the irritation, like eczema or psoriasis, or an infection with staph aureus."

Get rid of kidney stones.,
Seek medical care with antibiotics if you have an infection.,
Have surgery.,
Improve the state of your arteries.",How to Treat Kidney Pain3," Kidney stones usually cause severe pain that is “colicky” – crampy pain that comes and goes. If your doctor diagnoses you with kidney stones, you’ll likely spend a few days waiting to see if you can pass them on your own. This can be painful! Try pain relief at home, or ask your doctor for stronger pain medication. If you need medical assistance passing the stones, there are a number of treatments you can get in the hospital.Stay well-hydrated to help prevent kidney stones from recurring.

, If you recently had a UTI and now you’re having kidney pain, the infection from your bladder may have travelled up into your kidney. This type of kidney infection, called pyelonephritis, has to be treated quickly to prevent kidney damage. Try to see your doctor right away, and if you can’t get a same-day appointment, go to the hospital – they will give you antibiotics to treat the infection. For severe infections, you might have to stay in the hospital and have antibiotics through an IV (intravenously, or through a needle into your vein).Salpingitis, an infection of the fallopian tubes in women is sometimes called pelvic inflammatory disease, can also cause kidney-like pain. Salpingitis also requires antibiotics.Always take antibiotics exactly as your doctor prescribes.

, Sometimes, kidney pain is caused by a structural problem. Usually this requires having surgery to fix whatever problem is causing your pain. Surgery might also be necessary to remove a kidney, like if your pain is caused by a tumor. Having all or part of your kidney removed can help to manage your pain and prevent cancer from spreading.Most structural problems are diagnosed in children. ”Horseshoe kidney,” when the kidneys fuse together, is a common cause of kidney pain.If you can’t have surgery for some reason, your cancer team can treat your kidney tumor with chemotherapy and/or radiation. When the tumor shrinks, your pain may improve.

, Arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis, when your arteries harden or get clogged with plaque, can occur in any artery in your body – this is what leads to heart attacks and strokes.

Notify your doctor right away if you experience complications.",How to Take Care of an Incision After Thyroid Surgery3," Most patients will receive narcotic pain medications after surgery. Follow your doctor’s instructions for how to use these medications and do not exceed the recommended dosage.Keep in mind that prescription pain medications can cause constipation so it is important to drink eight to 10 glasses of water per day and eat foods that contain fiber. You may also want to take a mild stool softener to deal with constipation.
Do not take acetaminophen while you are on prescription pain medication or you may cause damage to your liver. Avoid taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications as well to avoid potential bleeding issues.

, Cool compresses such as a bag of ice or frozen peas wrapped in a towel may be applied to wound for 10 – 15 minutes to help with pain. You can do this once every hour. Make sure that you wrap the compress in a towel or a t-shirt to avoid frostbite., It is important to limit your neck movement for one to three weeks after your thyroid surgery. Stick to non-strenuous activities and doctor-approved neck exercises and avoid anything that might put pressure on your neck.Studies have shown that certain neck exercises decreased common complaints experienced by most patients, such as a feeling of neck pressure and a choking sensation. Studies have shown that patients who performed these neck exercises also had a decrease in their need for pain medications. Ask your doctor about neck exercises that involve flexion and hyperextension of the neck. With your doctor’s approval, you can perform these exercises three times a day, starting on the first post-operative day.Avoid any strenuous activities for the first week following surgery, this involves lifting greater than 5 lbs., swimming, running or jogging.

Adjust your positioning.,
Consult your doctor if the pain doesn't go away.",How to Soothe Sore Nipples2," The heat from the compress will help soothe your nipples. Using this method right after feeding will not only soothe the pain, but will also clean the area.Do not substitute a warm compress with other heating methods like a hair dryer or heater. These home remedies have been debunked and are considered harmful.Sore nipples is the most common reason for discontinuation of breast feeding in women, so it's important to tend to your nipples to relieve the pain.

, Natural nutrients in breast milk help soothe the soreness associated with breast feeding. It also has antibacterial properties, so this trick will help avoid infections as well. Allow your nipples to air dry after applying the milk to ensure that your skin absorbs as many nutrients as possible.

, To further protect the skin and prevent soreness in between feedings, you can apply lanolin cream to your nipples. This helps moisturize the skin and soothe the area. This product should be available in most drug stores and supermarkets.Alternatively, you could also apply petroleum jelly to the area. This will lock in moisture and prevent the area from rubbing against your clothes.Whether you use lanolin or petroleum jelly, keep it on until the next time you feed to keep your nipples protected. Then rinse it off with water right before feeding., If your nipples are tender before a feeding session, you can apply an ice pack to dull the pain.


Whether you use a commercial cold pack or a bag of ice, be sure to wrap it in a towel. Ice applied directly to the skin can cause frostbite.
Do not leave the ice on for longer than 20 minutes. This can damage the skin.

, If your nipples and breasts are very sore, a pain reliever will help. Be sure to use pain relievers in conjunction with other methods designed to help the nipples heal, otherwise you're just masking pain and not treating the problem.


In this case, acetaminophen is the best option, though NSAID pain relievers will also be effective. Both are safe to use while breast feeding, but you should still confirm with your doctor before taking any medication., If you've been experiencing a lot of soreness from breastfeeding, adjusting your position may help. See this guide for details about different positions.

, Persistent or unbearable pain isn't normal, and there may be another problem causing your pain. Visit your doctor for an examination to see if something else is causing your pain, or if you need to adjust your breastfeeding style. Cracked or chafed nipples may need antibiotic ointment treatment.

Consider your hormonal state when your nipples hurt.,
Apply a cold compress to your nipples.,
Take a pain reliever.,
Choose a more supportive bra.,
Visit your doctor if the pain persists.,
Ask your doctor about danazol.",How to Soothe Sore Nipples3," Hormonal changes in the body can cause the breasts and nipples to swell and feel sore. Usually imbalances in estrogen and progesterone are to blame for this. There are a few situations where these kinds of hormonal fluctuations are normal.


During pregnancy, especially during the first trimester.Right before or during menstruation.When women begin entering menopause.Men can also experience this. It is usually because of an imbalance of estrogen and testosterone. While men don't experience menstruation, pregnancy, or menopause, it's still common for hormones to fluctuate.Sore nipples can be caused by obesity and peripheral conversion of estrogen in fat cells. this can lead to gynecomastia.

, If your nipple pain is due to hormonal fluctuations, topical creams probably won't work. It is best to dull the pain with a cold compress. Remember to wrap any ice packs in a towel and apply them for no more than 20 minutes. If your nipples are still sore, you can reapply the compress after your skin has warmed up and all feeling has returned., To deal with the pain and tenderness in your nipples from hormone changes, take OTC pain relievers. This will help dull the pain and keep you comfortable.In this case, acetaminophen is the best option. NSAIDs reduce inflammation, which isn't causing your nipples to hurt in this case. NSAIDs will also be effective, however. Avoid aspirin if you are under 20 because of risk of Reye's Syndrome.

, If your nipples and breasts are sore, a more supportive bra can help alleviate the pain. This is especially important if you're pregnant to prevent stretching.You might also want to wear a sports bra while sleeping. If the breasts move at night, it could make the pain worse.

, If your pain lasts longer than a few days to a week, it could be an indication that another problem is causing it. Visit the doctor for an examination to see if you're suffering from another underlying problem that's causing your nipples to hurt., If your breast pain is persistent or unbearable, he or she may prescribe danazol. This drug has several uses, but can be used to treat swelling, pain, and tenderness in the breasts and nipples. However, it causes androgenic side effects that can limit its use. Ask your doctor if this drug would be helpful for you."

Take precautions regarding basic hygiene.,
Call your doctor if you develop a fever.,
Call your doctor if the incision starts to bleed.,
Seek medical attention if you develop any unusual symptoms.",How to Take a Shower After Surgery," Your doctor knows the extent of the surgery, and how to best proceed with the next steps in the healing process.


Each doctor has clear directions for you to follow for the first few days after surgery, including instructions for when it is safe to start bathing and showering. The directions are largely based on the type of surgery that was performed and the way the incision was closed during surgery.
The instructions about bathing and showering were provided at the time of your discharge. Contact your doctor promptly if this information has been misplaced, so you can prevent infection, avoid injury, and move forward with your recovery.;
, Knowing more about the method used to close your incision may help to prevent injury and infection.The most common four ways to close a surgical incision are: using surgical sutures, also called stitches; staples; wound closure strips, sometimes called butterfly band-aids or steri-strips; and liquid tissue glue.Many surgeons will also apply a waterproof bandage over the incision to allow you to shower as you normally would, when you feel up to it.Exposure to gentle streams of water 24 hours after surgery for incisions closed with tissue glue is considered acceptable in most cases.Sutures can be the kind that are removed once the tissue is healing, or they may be absorbable, and will dissolve into your skin without the need to be manually removed.Caring for incisions that were closed with sutures that need to be manually removed, staples, or wound closure strips similar to butterfly band-aids, may require keeping the area dry for a longer period of time. This can be accomplished by continuing to take sponge baths, or by covering the area when showering., If the incision does not need to be covered, take care to avoid scrubbing the area or rubbing it with a washcloth.Clean the area using mild soap and water, but do not let soap or other bath products get directly into the incision. Let clean water gently run over the area.Most surgeons recommend resuming the use of your normal soap and hair care products.

, Once you have showered, remove any coverings that may be over the incision (like gauze or a Band-aid, but not closure strips), and be sure the incision area is dry.


Gently pat the area with a clean towel or gauze pads.Do not wipe harshly and do not remove any visible sutures, staples, or wound closure strips that are still in place.
Avoid picking at the incision and allow scabs to remain until they naturally fall off, as they help to prevent the incision from further bleeding., Avoid using any topical products on the incision unless you are specifically directed to do so by your surgeon.Changing the dressing, according to the directions provided by your doctor, may include the use of topical products. Antibiotic creams or ointments may have been recommended as part of the dressing changes, but use topical products only if you were instructed to do so., After the time limit has passed for keeping the area dry, it is ok for the wound closure strips to get wet; however, they should not be removed until they are falling off.Gently pat the area dry, including the wound closure strips, as long as they are in place.

, Keeping the incision area dry, which may mean delaying your shower for 24 to 72 hours after your surgery, is thought to help prevent infection and promote healing.Follow your doctor’s instructions. There are many variables involved with surgery, and the risk of developing an infection or damaging the incision can be avoided by following your doctor’s specific directions.Keep clean gauze pads nearby to pat the area if needed throughout the day, even when you are not near water.

, Depending on the specific instructions provided by your surgeon, you may be able to shower when you feel up to it, if the incision is at a place on your body where you can carefully cover the area using a waterproof material.


Most surgeons will provide clear instructions for methods they prefer to cover the incision while showering.
Use clear plastic wrap, a trash bag, or a cling-type wrap, to completely cover the incision. Use medical tape around the edges to prevent water from seeping inside the covered area.For difficult to reach areas, get a family member or friend to cut plastic bags or plastic wrap to cover the area and tape it in place.
For shoulder and upper back areas, in addition to the cover placed on the incision, a garbage bag draped like a cape can be helpful in keeping water, soap, and shampoo away from the area as you shower. For a chest incision, drape the bag more like a bib., Until your instructions indicate you can proceed with a shower, you can feel more refreshed by taking a sponge bath and still keep the incision dry and unaffected.Use a sponge or washcloth dipped in water with small amounts of a mild soap. Dry yourself with a clean towel.

, Most surgeons recommend taking a shower once the time limit required to keep the area dry has passed, and you feel up to it.Do not soak the area, sit in a tub filled with water, sit in a hot tub, or go swimming for at least three weeks or until your doctor says it is ok to do so., Most surgeons recommend taking showers that last about five minutes until you are stronger and the incision is healing., Have someone with you at all times during the first few times you shower on your own.Depending on the type of surgery, you may want to use a shower stool, chair, or hand rails to provide stability and prevent falling.Surgeries that involve your knees, legs, ankles, feet, and back may make it difficult for you to safely balance in the small shower area, so using stools, chairs or rails, can help to provide additional support.

, Avoid a strong flow of water directly against the incision.


Adjust the water stream before entering the shower to provide a comfortable temperature and adjust the flow of the water to protect the incision.

, Infection is the most common complication that develops from having surgery.Contact your doctor immediately if you think your incision is becoming infected.Symptoms of infection include a temperature of 101°F (38.3°C) or higher, nausea and vomiting, severe pain, a new redness at the incision site, tenderness, a feeling of warmth to the touch, drainage that has an odor or is green or yellow in color, and new swelling around the area of the incision.Research suggests that as many as 300,000 people that have surgery each year in the United States will develop an infection. And, sadly, about 10,000 of those people with die from that infection., Some characteristics and situations make people more likely to develop an infection, or to have their incision re-open, than others.


Some risk factors include being obese, having diabetes or a weakened immune system, malnutrition, taking corticosteroids, or smoking., General steps you can take at home to help prevent infection include washing your hands thoroughly and often and always using clean supplies during dressing changes and after showering to pat the area dry.Always wash your hands after using the bathroom, handling garbage, touching pets, handling dirty laundry, touching anything that has been outside, and after handling soiled wound dressing materials.Take caution to advise family members and visitors to wash their hands before coming into contact with the person that had the surgery.Stop smoking at least two weeks prior to the surgery if possible, though four to six weeks is preferable. Smoking slows down the healing process,depriving the healing tissues of oxygen and potentially causing infection., Low-grade fevers following major surgery are not uncommon, but temperatures of 101°F (38.3°C) or higher may indicate an infection.Other signs of an infection that warrant contacting your doctor immediately include new areas of redness around the site, pus drainage from the incision, drainage that has an odor or is discolored, tenderness in the area, warmth to the touch, or new swelling in the area of the incision., Wash your hands thoroughly, and apply gentle pressure using clean gauze pads or clean towels. Contact your doctor immediately.Do not press firmly on the incision. Apply gentle pressure and wrap the area with clean, dry gauze until you can get to your doctor or to another medical facility to have the area examined., If you develop abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, or jaundice, which means yellowing of the skin or eyes, see a doctor as soon as possible.Or if you show the following symptoms of a blood clot: paleness, the extremity is cool to the touch, chest pain, shortness of breath, unusual swelling in an arm or leg."

Use a firm mattress.,
Lay on your back for neck pain.,
Try a side sleeping position for sciatica pain.,
Raise the head of the bed.,
Position your arm carefully.,
Wear a brace if you have one.",How to Sleep with a Pinched Nerve1," A firm mattress will support your body better, which may prevent your body from folding in on the nerve and making it hurt more. If your bed does not have a firm mattress, then you might consider sleeping on your sofa or in a recliner for the night.


You can also place a few boards under your mattress to increase the firmness and prevent it from sagging. Another option is to put your mattress on the floor until you have recovered from your pinched nerve.;
, If you are having neck pain from a pinched nerve, then try laying on your back. You can use pillows under your neck and knees to keep your spine as straight as possible. This position should help to alleviate some of the pain caused by the pinched nerve.Make sure your pillow is at the right level. Sometimes, flexing the neck can reduce pain. Some people will then begin using thicker pillows. Avoid this at all cost since this will also shorten the muscles in the front of the neck. Instead of raising the pillows, it may be better to raise the head of the bed, which is describe below.

, Your sciatic nerve extends from the lowest part of your back into your hips and buttocks, and down through your legs. When this nerve is pinched, it can cause pain and numbness in one leg or side of your lower back, hips, or buttocks.Sleeping on your side can help when sciatica is the cause of your pain.


If sleeping on your side feels comfortable, then lay on your side and bring your top leg up towards your chest. Use pillows to support the leg and make yourself as comfortable as possible.Choose the side that is most comfortable for you.

, Elevating the head of your bed may also provide some relief. If you are able to raise the head of your bed, try it and see if that feels more comfortable than laying flat on your back. If so, then you may want to try sleeping in this position.


Keep in mind that it is best to raise the entire head of your bed rather than to rely on pillows. You can raise up the head of your bed by about 6 to 9 inches by placing cement blocks or some sturdy wood under the upper legs of your bed. This strategy is also helpful if you deal with nighttime heartburn or GERD as well.If you cannot raise the head of your bed, then you might also try a wedge pillow or try placing a few pillows under your back to elevate your upper body.

, If you have a pinched nerve in your wrist or arm, then you will need to position it in a comfortable way. One option is to sleep on your back with the affected arm or wrist propped up on a pillow.


If you prefer to sleep on your side, then you can lie on your unaffected side and place a pillow in front of you to cradle your arm or wrist.
Do not sleep on the arm that is affected by the pinched nerve because this can make the condition worse., It may be necessary for you to wear a brace or a splint to keep the area around the pinched nerve from moving. This is common with a pinched nerve in your wrist. If your doctor has advised you to wear a brace or splint, then make sure that you wear it at night as well.You should limit wearing a brace to only at night. Avoid wearing it during the day to allow your muscles to get movement and exercise. Keeping your neck stiff will reduce muscle endurance and ultimately make your neck muscles weak.

Favor your side.,
Lean back on a pillow or blanket.,
Alternate by sleeping on your back.,
Place a pad under the joint.,
Pick a firm mattress.,
Maintain a good sleep schedule.,
Avoid sleep aids.,
Ice your hip before going to bed.,
Do regular low-impact exercise.,
Get a massage.,
Rest and relieve pain.,
Talk to a doctor about long-term pain relief.",How to Sleep with Hip Pain," It’s quite normal to toss and turn in the quest to find a comfortable position in bed. Some doctors recommend favoring your side if you have a painful hip. Obviously, make sure to avoid the bad side.Draw your knees up toward your body.
Place a pillow between your legs, too, if you’re sleeping on your side. This will keep your hips, pelvis, and spine better aligned.
If you don’t see any difference in your pain right away, don’t give up. You may need to experiment with the height of the pillow to find the best height for your hips.;
, While the best position is on your side with legs bent in and a pillow for support, you can tweak this position slightly if it makes your hip pain worse. Just take a pillow and place it under the small of your back and then, remaining on your side, lean back on the pillow. This will relieve the pressure from your hips. This position can be useful for pregnant women, who tend to develop hip pain in the third trimester as connective tissue relaxes and stretches to prepare for birth. They can also use a pillow to support their abdomen.
A rolled up a blanket will support the small of your back, as well.

, Some studies suggest that always sleeping on the same side can, over time, lead to muscle imbalance and pain. Switch things up by rolling all the way onto your back. Sleeping on your back is actually the healthiest position, as it distributes your weight evenly and reduces pressure points.Avoid sleeping on your stomach, as this position can be very stressful on the neck.
Use a pillow to support your neck when sleeping on your back.
Also, consider putting a pillow under your thighs to better support your hips in this position.

, Use extra bedding if you simply can’t avoid rolling onto your bad hip. Try a thin pillow or even an extra blanket to give the joint protection while you sleep, and to relieve pressure on it.Place the blanket or pad under your bad hip while on your back.
You might also try wearing thick pajamas or sweatpants to bed, or, in a pinch, wrapping a bandage around your waist.

, A good mattress is your foundation. It will align your body and give you support where you need it most – in this case, the hips. Talk with your doctor or orthopedic specialist about what kind of mattress will give you the best support and sleep.In general, you’ll need more support from your mattress. A firm mattress should provide this better than a softer kind, but make sure that it’s not too hard.
Add a foam pad to the top of the mattress, too, to increase support and distribute your weight more evenly.
Avoid mattresses with internal metal springs. These inner springs create pressure points, especially for side-sleepers and for joints like the hip. Instead, try a memory foam mattress, which will more even distribute your body weight.

, Losing sleep with hip pain is no fun. You’ll be better off if you make the most of the sleep you do get, though. Practice good sleep hygiene. Get into a healthy sleep schedule and maximize your rest, aiming for ideally 7 to 9 hours per night.Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. This rhythm is key. In fact, try to maintain your normal wakeup time even if you have a late night or sleep poorly.
Create a restful bedroom environment. Make sure your bed is comfortable and that the room is quiet, cool, and dark.
Relax in the evening. Starting a few hours before your bed time, start to unwind. Take a warm shower, for example, lower the lights, read a book, or play light or ambient music.
Avoid caffeine and other stimulants. Also, turn off electronic devices – backlit screens can actually disrupt your sleep patterns.

, A few days in a row of pained and disrupted sleep can be stressful as well as tiring. You might even consider a sleep aid. Resist the temptation to get to sleep artificially, however, as pills and other sleep aids can have bad side effects.Avoid drinking alcohol as a sleep aid, for one. Alcohol may help you fall asleep more quickly, but it disrupts your body’s normal sleep patterns and can make you feel groggy and fatigued in the morning.
Minimize your use of over-the-counter sleep aids, too. Many are habit-forming, meaning you’ll need a higher dosage over time and can have trouble falling asleep without them in the future. Some also cause you to feel groggy and foggy-headed when you wake up.
Only take sleep aids for short periods. When using them, always give yourself time for a full night’s sleep.

, Sometimes, hip pain can be caused by an increase in swelling of the bursa, which is the fluid-filled sac that cushions your joints. If you have been diagnosed with any sort of inflammatory condition, you may want to place an ice pack on your hip for 20 minutes before going to bed.


Make sure that you wrap the ice pack with a paper towel or other thin cloth. Do not place the ice pack directly on your skin or you will be at risk of frostbite.
Make sure to give your skin a break every 20 minutes as well and allow it to return to its normal temperature before using the ice pack again., When a joint hurts, we want to use it as little as we can to minimize pain and discomfort. In fact, you probably need to keep using your hip. Inactivity with a condition like arthritis can reduce the joint’s range of motion, increase stiffness, and aggravate pain. Plus, the exercise should help you to sleep.Have your doctor confirm that it’s safe to exercise your hip, first of all.
Try motion exercises, gently moving your hip through its full range. Walking, low-speed bicycling, and swimming can also be helpful.
Try to exercise most days, aiming for a total of about 150 minutes per week. Split up the exercise into 10 minute spurts if movement is uncomfortable.
An important effect of exercise is that it can help you to maintain a healthy weight or to lose weight, both of which will ease pressure and stress on your hips.

, Sometimes, hip pain can be caused by sore and tight muscles around the hip joint. Having a couple of sessions with a massage therapist may help to relieve this tension.Start off with 30 minute massage sessions to start getting some relief.


Keep in mind that it may take three to five sessions to feel a difference.
If your hip pain increases at night after getting a massage, make sure that you tell your therapist at the next visit.

, The idea of exercise is to gently work the hip – don’t overdo it or engage in exercise that’s hard on the joint. Rest the joint when not doing low impact exercises. You can also manage pain by taking over-the-counter pain relievers and anti-inflammatory medications.Avoid repeated bending of the hip or putting direct pressure on the joint. Try not to sleep on your bad side, as said, and also avoid prolonged sitting.
Ice the joint with wrapped ice cubes or a package of frozen vegetables if it becomes inflamed or painful. Or, alternatively, you can use a heat treatment like taking a warm shower.
Consider an over-the-counter medication like Ibuprofen, which will relieve pain but also has properties to reduce swelling and inflammation.

, You hip pain might be passing. However, it might be a chronic condition caused by osteoarthritis or another medical problem. Talk to your doctor about pain solutions if the problem is chronic. She’ll be able to advise you on a course of action depending on the condition.Ask about injections. Your doctor may be able to give you a steroid or cortisone injection to temporarily reduce joint inflammation and pain.
Consider physical therapy. Ask your doctor about therapy programs that can help strengthen the hip joint, increase flexibility, and maintain its range of motion.
You might also be a candidate for arthroscopic surgery. This is a non-invasive procedure that allows surgeons to explore your joint for problems and to repair damaged cartilage.

Try a heating pad.,
Apply an ice pack.,
Ask about corticosteroid injections.",How to Sleep with a Pinched Nerve2," Taking an over-the-counter (OTC) medicine may also make it easier for you to fall asleep and stay asleep. Try taking some ibuprofen, naproxen, or acetaminophen to help with the pain from your pinched nerve and make it easier for you to fall asleep.Make sure that you read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions before taking any OTC pain medicine.
If your doctor has prescribed painkillers for you, then make sure that you take these exactly as directed.

, Taking a warm shower before you go to bed can help to relax your muscles and may help to relieve some of the pain from the pinched nerve. Try taking a warm shower right before you go to bed to help soothe and relax the nerve., You may also want to apply a heating pad to the affected area to provide some relief. You can use a heating pad for up to 20 minutes at a time over the area of your pinched nerve. Try using a heating pad right before bed to provide some soothing relief before you go to bed.Remove the heating pad after 20 minutes to prevent it from burning your skin or causing tissue damage.You may even want to consider getting a heating pad that has a timer, just in case you fall asleep with the heating pad on.

, Ice works best on new injuries, which tend to swell up. You can apply an ice pack to the affected area to help numb it and reduce inflammation. Use an ice pack for no more than 20 minutes at a time.Make sure that you wrap the ice pack in a towel before applying it to your skin. Do not apply ice directly to your skin.
Give your skin a break from the ice pack after 20 minutes to prevent frostbite and tissue damage., If the pain from your pinched nerve keeps you awake at night, then you may want to ask your doctor about corticosteroid injections. Your doctor can administer a corticosteroid injection to help reduce inflammation and swelling around your pinched nerve."

Turn off all devices.,
Dim the lights.,
Play some soothing music or white noise.,
Adjust the temperature.,
Use a relaxation aid to help you sleep.",How to Sleep with a Pinched Nerve3," Computers, televisions, cell phones, and other devices can make it harder for you to wind down and fall asleep. These devices can also affect the quality of your sleep.Try to turn off all of these devices at least 30 minutes before you plan to go to bed.


Avoid watching television in bed, reading in bed, or doing anything else that might activate your mind. Your bedroom activities should be limited to sleep and sex.
Another strategy to use for your computer is using software that adjusts the light on your computer based upon the time of day.

, Dimming the lights in your bedroom will help to send the signal to your brain and body that it is time for sleep. Make sure that the lights in your home are turned down low about 30 minutes before bedtime.


It is best to make your room as dark as possible when you go to sleep, but you can have a dim light if needed. Try plugging in a night light or using a flameless candle to provide some soothing dim light in your bedroom.
If your room gets a lot of light from outside sources, then you can try using light blocking curtains or wear a sleep mask., Music can help you to relax and start to drift off to sleep as well. If you have a hard time sleeping with music playing, then you might enjoy some white noise instead, such as some rain sounds or the sound of ocean waves crashing on a beach.


A fan or air purifier will also provide you with some soothing white noise.
White noise helps to raise the sound threshold so that you will not be startled awake by normal ambient noises, such as a passing car or barking dog., A cool temperature is best for sleeping. Before you go to bed, adjust the temperature in your bedroom so that it is somewhat cool, around 60 to 67°F (15.5 to 19.4°C).You can experiment within this range to see what works best for you.


If your bedroom gets hot in the summer, you can use a fan or air conditioning unit to cool down your room.

, Your pinched nerve pain might have you feeling anxious and stressed and this can make it hard to fall asleep. To help yourself relax, try using a relaxation aid. Some good choices include:



Deep breathing. Taking slow deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth may also make it easier for you to fall asleep and stay asleep.

Progressive muscle relaxation. Progressive muscle relaxation is where you gradually tense and release your muscles, starting with your toes and moving up to the top of your head. This exercise can help you to feel calmer and prepare you for a good night’s sleep.Herbal tea. Sipping a cup of herbal tea before bedtime may also help you fall asleep. Some good choices include chamomile, peppermint, rooibos, and herbal blends that have been specially formulated to promote rest and relaxation.

Check with your pharmacist before mixing your medication.,
Mix your liquid medicine into a strongly-flavored drink.,
Ask your pharmacist if he can add flavor to your medicine.,
Chill your medicine before taking it.,
Suck on an ice cube or ice pop before taking the medicine.,
Check with your pharmacist before altering your medication.,
Crush your pills and mix them into food.,
Suck on an ice cube before taking the medicine.",How to Swallow Bitter Medicine," The easiest way to take bitter liquid medicine is by mixing it with a better-tasting drink. This is usually fine with most medications, but you have to be careful. There could be interactions between your drug and certain liquids. Grapefruit juice, for example, has become notorious for inhibiting the effectiveness of several drugs, including Lipitor, Zocor, and Allegra.Check with your pharmacist and ask what the best kind of liquid is for your medication, and if there are any juices that will interact with your drug.;
, Usually fruit juices work best for this because they have strong tastes that can overwhelm the taste of the medicine.Make sure to measure out the correct dose of your medicine. Then pour this into a full glass of juice or water and drink it quickly.
Drink the glass entirely to ensure that you get the full dosage of medicine.
Carbonated beverages may not be the best choice for this method- the bubbles will make it hard to swallow fast. Milk may also not work best because mixing it with medicine could cause an upset stomach.You may also want to ""chase,"" or follow the medication with pleasant tasting drink afterwards can assist in erasing the foul taste.
Never mix your medicine with alcohol. Alcohol interacts with many medications and it can be harmful to drink while taking medication.

, Sometimes pharmacists can modify your medicine by adding flavors like cherry or bubblegum. This will help remove the bitter taste and make taking the medicine much easier. A trained compounding pharmacist should be able to do this for most medicines in liquid form, including prescription and non-prescription medications. If you have trouble taking your medicine because of its taste, ask your pharmacist about this option.Ask pharmacist about availability of flavoured medicine.

, Medicines usually have less taste when cold. If you can't dilute your medicine, you can try serving it cold to reduce the bitter taste. Leave it in the refrigerator for about an hour before taking it to ensure that it is sufficiently cold.Check with the pharmacist prior to doing this as certain medications can become unstable in severe fluctuations of temperature.

, This will numb your mouth and make it harder to taste. With your mouth numbed, you can swallow the medicine before getting too much of a bitter taste.Suck on either an ice cube or ice pop until your mouth is numb- probably around five minutes. Then drink your medicine quickly before you regain feeling in your mouth.
Have water or juice standing by. Drink this right after taking your medicine. If you don't drink something, you'll get the medicine taste as soon as your mouth warms up.

, Many methods for taking pills involve grinding or breaking the pills and mixing them into food. Before doing this, make sure this won't inhibit the effectiveness of your medicine. Some pills have time-release coating and can be harmful if ground up. Oxycontin, for example, is wrapped in an extended release coating and can cause an overdose if crushed. Some other common, non-prescription medicines that shouldn't be crushed are Motrin, Claritin-D, and Bayer aspirin.The Institute for Safe Medical Practices has compiled this list of pills you should not crush. New medications come out often, however, so always check with your pharmacist before grinding up a pill. There are other options if you can't crush your pills.
For some medications (like oxycontin) there are abuse deterrent formulations that still require this medication to be swallowed whole, but if crushed or tampered with inactivates the active ingredient.

, If you've consulted your pharmacist and confirmed that it is safe to crush your pills, then use this opportunity to take your medicine with food you enjoy.At the same time, be careful when doing this with your favorite foods, as adding your bitter medicine can cause an aversion to your favorite food if it tastes horrible.


Before crushing a pill, moisten it with a few drops of water. Let it soften for 15 minutes.
Purchase a pill crusher. Otherwise use a mortar and pestle or crush the pill using a spoon. Do this carefully so you don't lose any of the medication.
Add the crushed pill to food. Any food will do, but sweet things usually work best. Sweet flavors will be most effective at distracting your taste buds from the medicine's taste. Things like ice cream, chocolate or vanilla pudding, honey, or chocolate syrup usually work best.

, If you have to take a foul-tasting pill and aren't allowed to have it with food, you can use the same mouth-numbing trick as you used with liquid. Suck on an ice cube until your mouth is numb. Then place the pill in your mouth, chew if necessary, and swallow with a gulp of water.If you use this method, be sure to check your mouth after you swallow to ensure the pill went down. With your mouth numb, you may not be able to feel the pill.

Consult your physician about what type and how much acidophilus to take.,
Take acidophilus and antibiotics separately.,
Take acidophilus appropriately to increase effectiveness.,
Consider eating foods high in acidophilus.",How to Take Acidophilus With Antibiotics1," Your doctor will able to best indicate a daily dosage and the form of acidophilus to take. Dosages can range, however for antibiotics-associated diarrhea, 10 – 20 billion CFU per day has been shown to help.Your doctor may suggest you take smaller or larger dosages depending upon the antibiotic taken, length of time you are taking the antibiotic, and your likeliness to get colitis. Some antibiotics, like cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and clindamycin, are more likely to cause antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
In addition, there are many different dosage forms available such as capsules, tablets, and powders. Use only the form of acidophilus your doctor recommends. Do not mix different types of acidophilus, such as tablets or powders, because each formula contains different strains of bacteria.
Use for as long as your doctor recommends. Generally probiotics are used for at least one to three weeks longer than the duration of antibiotic treatment.;
, If you take both at the same time, they will not work as effectively. This is because the probiotic is promoting good bacteria, while the antibiotic is depleting your system of good bacteria.


Take acidophilus at least one to two hours before or one to two hours after you take your antibiotic. Some recommend two to four hours apart., Make sure the supplement has not expired and has been stored correctly. Expired supplements or supplements that should have been refrigerated but were not may lose effectiveness. Make sure you take it routinely. Sometimes manufacturers or prescribers may suggest taking it with food or taking it right before breakfast as a higher gastric pH may be favorable., The most common of these foods is yogurt. Many commercial brands of yogurt contain probiotics, such as acidophilus. There are even brands that advertise the probiotics that they contain.Eating yogurt daily will add acidophilus to your diet, but a lower amount than if you take a supplement.

Low-dose aspirin
Immunosuppressant drugs
Anti-rejection medication (such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus) following an organ transplant;
, Your doctor may prescribe a medication like allopurinol or febuxostat. These medications work to block the production of uric acid, which can cause gout. Your doctor may prescribe these if you have several attacks a year or if the attacks are painful.Febuxostat may cause changes to your liver enzymes. Allopurinol can cause skin rashes, anemia, and can sometimes increase joint pain., You might get a prescription for probenecid, which increases the excretion of uric acid and can reduce complications from gout. This medication helps your kidneys remove uric acid, but it means that you'll have more uric acid in your urine. This can cause other health issues like kidney stones, stomach ache, or rash. Always follow your doctor's dosing recommendations.Side effects of probenecid include headaches, joint pain, and rapid breathing., To deal with serious attacks of gout, your doctor may want you to take an NSAIDS like indomethacin or celecoxib.Prescription NSAIDS can cause bleeding, ulcers, or stomach pain. Make sure to follow your doctor's dosing recommendation.

, Talk with your doctor about taking over-the-counter OTC non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen or naproxen sodium. Your doctor might want you to take an OTC medication after you've taken higher dosage NSAIDS. This combination can stop an attack of gout.You'll probably be prescribed 800 mg of ibuprofen to be taken three to four times a day. OTC medications are usually used only during an attack, so stop taking them after your symptoms clear up., Your body breaks down purine in food to produce uric acid which contributes to gout pain. Either avoid purine-rich food or limit your servings to two to four servings a week. If you've had kidney stones that contain uric acid or currently have an episode of gout, avoid purine-rich food completely. Foods rich in purine include:Alcohol
Sugary soft drinks
Fatty foods such as fried foods, butter, margarine and high-fat dairy products
Organ meats. These foods have the highest levels of purines.
Beef, chicken, pork, bacon, veal, venison
Anchovies, sardines, herring, mussels, codfish, scallops, trout, haddock, crab, oyster, lobster, shrimp

, Some foods can protect against high uric acid levels. Try to eat foods rich in phytate which can prevent kidney stone formation, including kidney stones with uric acid. To get phytate, eat two to three servings of beans, legumes, and whole grains every day. The following foods are also helpful in treating gout and kidney stones:Calcium rich foods, including low-fat dairy products
Tart cherry juice: Drink three to four 8-ounce glasses of organic juice every day for relief within 12 to 24 hours.

, There are several supplements that are recommended to treat gout. Consider taking omega-3 fatty acids (especially EPA), bromelain (which acts as an anti-inflammatory), or the B vitamin folate, quercitin, or Devil's Claw (all of which reduce uric acid levels). Take the supplements according to the manufacturer's dosing recommendations and always talk to your doctor before supplementing.Some supplements may interfere with medication.


Bromelain is an enzyme that comes from pineapples and is often used to treat digestive issues.
Anyone with gout should avoid supplemental Vitamin C or niacin. Both of these vitamins may increase uric acid levels.

, While you may be cutting a lot of foods out of your diet, don't forget to add healthy foods. Eat plenty of vegetables to get a variety of health benefits and nutrients. While some vegetables (like asparagus, spinach, and mushrooms) contain purines, studies have shown they do not increase your chances of gout.Eating healthy is an important part of maintaining a healthy weight. Losing weight or maintaining a healthy weight can keep your uric acid levels low.

, Don't be surprised if symptoms appear suddenly. They often occur at night. Symptoms are usually the most painful within the first 4 to 12 hours after the initial attack. These symptoms include:Intense joint pain: in feet (often at the base of the big toe), ankles, knees, or wrists
Joint discomfort after the initial attack
Redness and other signs of inflammation, like warmth, swelling and tenderness
Difficulty moving the affected joint

, There are some risk factors you can't control, like a family history of gout or the prevalence of gout in adult men and postmenopausal women. But, you can control other risk factors like being overweight (or obese), untreated high blood pressure, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and heart and kidney disease.Recent surgery or trauma also increases your risk for gout.

, If you are unsure whether you have gout, talk with your doctor. Your doctor will make a diagnosis based on your symptoms and medical history. Further testing and lab work might be needed.


Testing may include taking a sample of joint fluid, running a blood test to see your uric acid levels, or getting an X-ray, ultrasound, or CT scan (although imaging tests aren't usually used).Joint fluid is analyzed for the presence of urate crystals that are visible under the microscope."

Learn about acidophilus.,
Know what acidophilus is used for and how it works with antibiotics.,
Understand why preventing antibiotic-induced diarrhea important.",How to Take Acidophilus With Antibiotics2," What is acidophilus? Acidophilus (Lactobacillus acidophilus or L. acidophilus) is a type of “good bacteria” in your body. The good bacteria helps to break down food in your colon and protect against “bad bacteria” by producing lactic acid. Acidophilus is naturally found in your body and may be taken as a probiotic supplement to help with various GI issues and other conditions.


In addition to acidophilus, there are many other probiotics available, some in the Lactobacillus species. However, Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most commonly used probiotic., Clinical studies have found that acidophilus suppresses the growth of pathogens (something that can cause disease, such as bad bacteria) in the digestive tract. It can be used to manage gastrointestinal conditions (such as irritable bowel syndrome), aid digestion, reduce vaginal yeast infections, help with other conditions such as lung infections or skin issues, and reduce antibiotic-induced diarrhea.In the case of antibiotic-induced diarrhea, when you take antibiotics to rid your body of the bad bacteria that is causing infection, you can lose some of the beneficial bacteria that are in your gut. A decrease in healthy bacteria can lead to the overgrowth of “bad” bacteria that can produce toxins, and cause inflammation and diarrhea., Most of the time, antibiotic-associated diarrhea is mild and goes away after you stop the antibiotic. However, sometimes it can lead to serious issues like colitis (inflammation of your colon) or a serious type of colitis called pseudomembranous colitis. About one third of the time, long term (usually hospital) antibiotic use can lead to a Clostridium difficile infection, which is a serious infection that is hard to cure and causes frequent diarrhea.Recent important studies have shown that probiotics like acidophilus can prevent or reduce antibiotic-associated diarrhea and may also be helpful in preventing C difficile infection.C. diff occurs most commonly after the use of fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, clindamycin, and penicillins.

Consider your reasons for no longer wanting to take Wellbutrin.,
Monitor any side effects.,
Talk to your doctor.,
Discontinue Wellbutrin slowly.,
Taper based on your doctor’s schedule.,
Document any effects you experience.,
Keep your doctor informed.,
Take any new medications according to your doctor’s prescription.",How to Stop Taking Wellbutrin1," Wellbutrin is usually very effective at controlling symptoms of depression. Generally, those taking the drug should continue it to help manage the respective depression or disorder unless directed otherwise by a care provider; however, there are a few good reasons to discontinue or change the therapy, including:


If you experience severe or continuous side effects
If your depression or disorder is not under control with Wellbutrin. For example, your depression may not be adequately controlled if you have persistent sad, anxious or empty feelings, irritability, loss of interest in pleasurable activities or hobbies, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, sleep disturbances such as insomnia or excessive sleeping, appetite changes, thoughts of suicide, or physical aches and pains.It is important to note that Wellbutrin generally takes up to eight weeks to fully work and may require dosage increases.If you have been on Wellbutrin for a while (six to 12 months) and your doctor feels that you are not at risk for (or do not have) chronic or recurrent depression;
, Some mild side effects of the medication can include: nausea, dry mouth, drowsiness, weight loss, insomnia, anxiety, changes in taste, frequent urination, and uncontrollable shaking. Let your doctor know if any of these side effects are severe or do not go away.


Serious side effects include seizures, hallucinations, irregular heartbeat, or allergic reactions. Stop taking Wellbutrin, and call your doctor right away if you experience any serious side effects.
Ideas of suicide may present in younger adults and children. Let your doctor know right away if you have thoughts related to suicide.

, Discuss your reasons for wanting to stop taking Wellbutrin with your doctor. Inform your doctor if you feel you don't need medication any longer, have trouble with side effects, or feel that your medication is not working after waiting the initial eight weeks for it to fully work. This will help your doctor make an informed decision and decide if the time is right for you to stop taking Wellbutrin.

, Antidepressants need to be slowly discontinued with gradual decrease in doses to avoid discontinuation symptoms. This is called tapering. Wellbutrin is usually tapered for approximately two weeks before stopping the medication completely. If you stop right away or go “cold turkey,” your body does not have enough time to adjust, and you may experience worse discontinuation symptoms. Note that these symptoms may be different than the SSRI discontinuation symptoms, or those of other antidepressants. Symptoms can occur within hours to three days after discontinuation and may include:Abdominal issues such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or cramps
Sleep issues such as insomnia or nightmares
Balance issues such as dizziness or lightheadedness
Sensory or movement issues such as numbness, tingling, tremors, and lack of coordination
Feelings of irritability, agitation, or anxiety
This constellation of symptoms is sometimes called ""discontinuation syndrome""

, The length of time it takes to completely stop taking Wellbutrin may depend on how long you were on the medication and the dose you were prescribed. Your doctor will determine the best way to taper Wellbutrin.


The usual target dose of Wellbutrin according to the manufacturer is 300 mg per day in the form of 150 mg twice daily (with a maximum dose at 400mg per day as 200 mg twice daily);however, your specific prescription may vary. Always follow prescribed dosages.
The standard reduction schedule for patients at the target dosage of 300 mg daily is to reduce to 200 mg at the first reduction, followed by subtracting 50 mg on subsequent reductions;however, the amount of time and dosage between reductions will ultimately depend on your first initial reaction to the first reduction, which your doctor will monitor closely to help your determine the best reduction schedule for you. The process can take anywhere from weeks to months depending on the individual patient.For regular, immediate release tablets your doctor may recommend cutting the tablet to change the dose; however, it is important to note that Wellbutrin is usually prescribed as a longer-acting tablet. With extended or sustained release formulations, you cannot cut the tablets. Tapering these formulations may include having to prescribe lower dose tablets or taking the same dose at longer intervals such as every other day.
Keep track of your tapering schedule by writing down the dates and the dosage changes.

, Even if you are tapering off Wellbutrin, it is still possible to experience discontinuation symptoms, such as the ones mentioned in Part 1. Keep track and talk to your doctor if you develop any of these symptoms.


Discontinuation symptoms have a quick onset, slowly get better over one to two weeks, and include more physical complaints. In order to differentiate between relapse and discontinuation symptoms, look at when the symptoms start, how long they last, and the type of symptoms.
While discontinuation symptoms with bupropion are not common, there is a greater risk of side effects with discontinuing if the patient not starting a new antidepressant with a similar pharmacodynamic profile.
Relapse, or the recurrence of your depression, may also occur with discontinuation of your therapy. Keep you doctor informed about how you are feeling and if you have concerns about a relapse. Relapse symptoms gradually develop after two to three weeks and get worse over two to four weeks. Contact your doctor if any symptoms last more than one month., It is crucial to keep your doctor informed about your progress whether you develop any symptoms or not. In addition, inform your doctor about any relapse symptoms or concerns you may have. Your doctor will monitor you for at least a few months after discontinuation.

, If you are discontinuing Wellbutrin because of side effects or if Wellbutrin is not controlling your depression, your doctor may prescribe a different antidepressant. Choice of medication depends on many aspects such as patient preference, prior response, effectiveness, safety and tolerance, cost, side effects, and drug interactions.If you experienced side effects or inadequate control of your depression, your doctor may recommend:


Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including Prozac (fluoxetine), Zoloft (sertraline), Paxil (paroxetine), Celexa (citalopram), or Lexapro (escitalopram)
Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), such as Effexor (venlafaxine)
Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs), such as Elavil (amitriptyline)
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) can also be used after waiting at least two weeks after discontinuation of Wellbutrin."

However, there are good reasons to discontinue or change your medication under the supervision of a doctor. These reasons include:


If you experience severe or continuous side effects.
If your depression or disorder is not under control with Zoloft. This may mean persistent sad, anxious, or empty feelings; irritability; loss of interest in pleasurable activities or hobbies; fatigue; difficulty concentrating; sleep disturbances such as insomnia or excessive sleeping; appetite changes; thoughts of suicide; or physical aches and pains.It is important to note that Zoloft generally takes up to eight weeks to fully work and may require dosage increases.If you have been on Zoloft for a while (6-12 months) and your doctor feels that you are not at risk for (or do not have) chronic or recurrent depression.;
, Some side effects of the medication can include: nausea, dry mouth, drowsiness, weight loss, insomnia, changes in sex drive, and uncontrollable shaking. Let your doctor know if any of these side effects are severe or do not go away.


In addition, ideas of suicide may be present in younger adults and children. Let your doctor know right away if you have thoughts related to suicide.

, Discuss your side effects or other reasons for wanting to stop taking Zoloft with your doctor. This will help your doctor make an informed decision and decide if the time is right for you to stop taking Zoloft.


If you have been on the medication for less than eight weeks, your doctor will likely suggest you give the medication the full eight weeks to take effect.

, Antidepressants need to be slowly discontinued with gradual decrease in doses to avoid discontinuation symptoms. This is called tapering. Tapering can take weeks to months depending on the antidepressant, how long you have taken it, your dose, and your symptoms.If you stop right away—go “cold turkey”—your body does not have enough time to adjust, and you may experience worse discontinuation symptoms. Symptoms may include:Abdominal issues such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or cramps
Sleep issues such as insomnia or nightmares
Balance issues such as dizziness or lightheadedness
Sensory or movement issues such as numbness, tingling, tremors, and lack of coordination
Feelings of irritability, agitation, or anxiety

, The length of time it takes to completely stop taking Zoloft may depend on how long you were on the medication and the dose you were prescribed. Your doctor will determine the best schedule for you to taper off Zoloft while minimizing the potential for discontinuation symptoms.


One suggested way is decreasing the dose by 25mg per dose reduction, giving at least two weeks in between each dose reduction.Keep track of your tapering schedule by writing down the dates and the dosage changes.
Expect to taper off the medication over several weeks. If you were on Zoloft for a long time, then you will likely taper off of it over four to six weeks. If you start to experience intolerable withdrawal symptoms, then your doctor may decide to taper the dosage at a slower rate.

, Even if you are tapering Zoloft, it is still possible to experience discontinuation symptoms. You may also be at risk of experiencing a relapse with regard to your depression or disorder. Keep track and talk to your doctor if you develop any of these symptoms.


Discontinuation symptoms have a quick onset, slowly get better over 1-2 weeks, and include more physical complaints. In order to differentiate between relapse and discontinuation symptoms, look at when the symptoms start, how long they last, and the type of symptoms.
Relapse symptoms gradually develop after 2-3 weeks and get worse over 2-4 weeks. Contact your doctor if any symptoms last more than 1 month., Your doctor will monitor you for at least a few months after discontinuation. Inform him or her about any relapse symptoms or concerns you may have. You may want to follow-up with your doctor more closely during this time period.

, If you are discontinuing Zoloft because of side effects or if Zoloft is not controlling your depression, your doctor may prescribe a different antidepressant. The choice of medication depends on many aspects such as patient preference, prior response, effectiveness, safety and tolerability, cost, side effects, and drug interactions.If you experienced side effects or inadequate control of your depression, you doctor may recommend:


A different selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), including Prozac (fluoxetine), Paxil (paroxetine), Celexa (citalopram), or Lexapro (escitalopram)
Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), such as Effexor (venlafaxine)
Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCA), such as Elavil (amitriptyline).
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) can also be used after waiting at least five weeks after discontinuation of Zoloft."

Talk to your doctor before taking any Bentonite (there are many natural clays).,
Purchase a good quality Bentonite, either in liquid suspension form (usually packaged in glass bottles), or in powder form.

Suggested use -- Laxative: so, at the first sign of colds or fluor infections, put 2 Tablespoons of liquid Bentonite into a glass, add 2 oz.",How to Substitute Bentonite for Antibiotics," Clay natural chemical concentrations vary, as: Sodium-/Na-bentonite; Potassium-/K-bentonite and Aluminum-/Al-bentonite and even Calcium-/Ca-bentonite (sold as one of several kind of fuller's earth).Caution: Some ""bentonite clay"" does not say what its constituents may be. So, grabbing your spoon is not highly recommended. Some bentonite clay is called Montmorillonite -- a very soft phyllosilicate group of minerals that typically form in microscopic crystals, that form a clay.

Ask your doctor or pharmacist about dosage.",How to Take Acidophilus Probiotics1," Acidophilus is a good bacteria that helps to break down food in your colon and protect against bad bacteria. Clinical studies have found that acidophilus suppresses the growth of pathogens such as bad bacteria, or substances that can cause disease, in the digestive tract. Acidophilus is a probiotic that can be used to manage gastrointestinal conditions, reduce antibiotic-induced diarrhea, aid digestion, and help with other conditions such as lung infections or skin issues. In addition to the small intestine, acidophilus naturally occurs in the vaginal area and may also be helpful in controlling bacterial infections and yeast infections. In addition to acidophilus, there are many other probiotics available, some in the Lactobacillus species.


However, Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most commonly used probiotic.Other studies are being done to see if probiotics are effective for lactose intolerance, helping the immune system, and other conditions.;

Learn how Prozac works.,
Consider your side effects.,
Recognize emergency side effects.,
Think about whether Prozac is controlling your symptoms.,
Understand the dangers of discontinuing antidepressants.",How to Stop Taking Prozac1," Prozac works by inhibiting how receptors in your brain reabsorb (or “reuptake”) the neurotransmitter serotonin. Serotonin is a naturally occurring chemical “messenger” (neurotransmitter) that helps maintain mood balance. Research suggests that a deficit of serotonin is a contributing factor in clinical depression.Prozac helps keep your receptors from reabsorbing too much serotonin, thereby increasing the amount available to your body.Prozac is an SSRI because it’s “selective.” It seems to primarily operate on serotonin and not any of the other neurotransmitters that are also partially responsible for mood.;
, Prozac can cause some side effects. Many of these will be mild or go away after four to five weeks. You should talk with your doctor if you have severe side effects or symptoms, or if they do not go away. Possible side effects include:Nervousness
Nausea
Dry mouth
Sore throat
Drowsiness
Weakness
Uncontrollable shaking
Loss of appetite
Weight loss
Changes in sex drive or function
Excessive sweating

, In some cases, Prozac may cause side effects that must be attended to immediately. Prozac has been known to increase the likelihood of suicidal thoughts, especially in people under the age of 24. If you experience thoughts about or consider plans to harm or kill yourself, seek immediate medical attention.You should also call your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following symptoms:


New or worsening depression
Extreme feelings of worry, agitation, or panic
Aggressive behavior or irritability
Acting without thinking
Severe restlessness
Feelings of frenzied, abnormal excitement

, Prozac is generally an effective antidepressant for most people. However, it may not work with every person’s brain, or neurochemistry. If you continue to experience any of the following after taking Prozac, talk with your doctor. These could be signs that your depression or disorder is not being adequately managed by the medication.You are experiencing severe or continuous side effects (mentioned above)
You continue to feel loss of interest in pleasurable activities or hobbies
Your fatigue does not improve
Your sleep is disturbed (insomnia, excessive sleeping)
You continue to have difficulty concentrating
You experience changes in appetite
You experience physical aches and pains

, Because antidepressants alter your brain chemistry, discontinuing them without medical supervision can cause serious symptoms.Longer-acting medications, such as Prozac, usually have fewer discontinuation symptoms. However, you may still experience side effects such as:

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or cramping
Sleep issues, such as insomnia or nightmares
Balance issues, such as dizziness or lightheadedness
Sensory or movement issues, such as numbness, tingling, tremors, and lack of physical coordination
Feelings of irritability, agitation, or anxiety


Antidepressants need to be discontinued slowly over a period of time by gradually reducing the dose. This is known as “tapering.” Tapering can take weeks or months, depending on the antidepressant, how long you have taken it, your dosage, and your symptoms. Your doctor will determine the best way for you to taper Prozac.You may experience a relapse of depressive symptoms once you have stopped taking Prozac. To distinguish between discontinuation symptoms and a relapse, think about when the symptoms start, how long they last, and what type they are.
Discontinuation symptoms usually develop quickly. They will usually improve over one to two weeks. They will often include more physical complaints, such as nausea or aches and pains.
Relapse symptoms gradually develop after two to three weeks. They generally worsen over two to four weeks. If any symptom continues to last more than a month, consult your doctor.

While you might feel better or even need to discontinue the pills because of pregnancy or another condition, going off Effexor cold turkey can have serious consequences. Talking to your doctor can help you make an informed decision about alternative treatments or quitting Effexor altogether.Avoid stopping or tapering off Effexor until you speak to your doctor. Continue to follow the instructions your doctor gave you when he or she prescribed the medication.
Tell your doctor the reasons why you want stop Effexor. Make sure you are completely honest about your reasons so that your doctor can consider the best treatment options for you. You may have a wide variety of reasons why you want to go off Effexor from feeling better to pregnancy or breastfeeding and other drug interactions.Make sure to listen to your doctor’s suggestions. Ask questions if you have them, including the benefits and risks to stopping the drug as well as if there are alternatives to the doctor’s suggestions. You can always get a second medical opinion if need be.;
, No matter how long you’ve been taking Effexor, give yourself plenty of time to stop the drug. Although it’s tempting to just stop altogether, this can cause difficult and uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms and may make you feel worse. Depending on your dosage, you’ll need to give yourself anywhere from one week to several months to stop taking Effexor. Based on your condition and dosage, your doctor can help you formulate a rough estimate of the time you’ll need to stop taking Effexor., You’ll need to reduce your dosage of Effexor slowly. There are no hard and fast rules of how best to plan your taper other than to work with your doctor to individualize it to you and your body. This means that you how much you reduce your doses and the at which interval you do so can vary greatly depending on factors such as how you feel and withdrawal symptoms.Consult your doctor about your taper plan to see if it is feasible for you.


Take one to two weeks to taper off Effexor if you’ve only taken the medication for less than eight weeks. If you’ve been on Effexor for six to eight months, you should wait at least one week in between dose reductions. For those people on Effexor for maintenance, taper much more gradually. For example, don’t reduce the dose by more than ¼ every four to six weeks.Write your plan on a sheet of paper or in a notebook where you write other things such as your mood or problems you encounter. For example, you can write a plan that says, “Starting dose: 300mg; 1st reduction: 225mg; 2nd dose reduction: 150mg; 3rd dose reduction: 75mg; 4th dose reduction: 37.5mg.”, Once you’ve spoken with your doctor and have a plan, you’ll need to make sure that your dose is proper to your plan. You can either have your doctor prescribe you a specifically dosed pill, have the pharmacist split your pills, or even split the pills yourself with a commercially available pill splitter.If you are taking Effexor XR, you will need to switch to regular Effexor. This is because the XR is an extended-release pill, and cutting it in half affects the mechanism by which the medication is released. This means it is possible to overdose, because too much will be released at once.Get a pill splitter from your local pharmacy or medical supply store. Ask a pharmacist or staff if the product will suit your needs for splitting your pills.

, As you taper off Effexor, it’s important to monitor your mood and physical symptoms as you reduce doses. You may even want to make a weekly assessment of how you feel. This can alert you to possible problems or if you should more gradually go off of the drug.Keep a weekly diary as a part of your plan. Note your doses and how you’re feeling. If you’re feeling good and have few withdrawal symptoms, you can continue to taper off according to your schedule. Remember to not accelerate your plan so that you prevent possible withdrawal symptoms.Consider keeping a “mood calendar” for each day of the week. You can rate how your mood is on a scale from 1-10 daily in order to identify problems or recognize patterns in your symptoms with dose reductions., If your symptoms get worse or you experience severe withdrawal, consider stopping the taper. You can always add back half your dose or all of it until you feel better again. At that point, you can continue reducing your doses at a smaller rate., Throughout the process of tapering off your Effexor, it’s important to keep your doctor informed about your progress. Let your doctor know if you have setbacks or experience withdrawal. Your doctor may suggest a new plan or alternative treatments to deal any setbacks you may experience when stopping Effexor.If you have difficulty getting off Effexor, your doctor may switch you to fluoxetine (Prozac). Then you can taper off the fluoxetine without experiencing the withdrawal symptoms.

, Venlafaxine has one of the highest rates of people experiencing withdrawal from Effexor.You may or may not experience symptoms as you reduce your dosage, but it’s good to recognize what symptoms are typical of Effexor withdrawal.

Agitation
Anxiety
Chills
Sweating
Runny nose
Tremor
Feelings of unease or foreboding

, As you come off of your Effexor, you will need as much support as possible. This can help you tackle withdrawal symptoms and other side effects you may experience.Continue to keep your doctor informed about your progress. You may even want to see a psychiatrist or psychologist as an alternative form of therapy to help you out while you’re stopping Effexor. This can minimize symptoms and may also give you new coping mechanisms.
Let your family and friends know that you’re stopping Effexor and may experience withdrawal symptoms. Let them know the ways in which they can help you.
Take some time off of work if necessary. Be honest with your boss about your condition. If you cannot take off any time, ask your boss ways you can contribute if you are experiencing withdrawal or recurrence of symptoms.

, Exercise helps produce serotonin and can have a powerful antidepressant effect. If you’re stopping Effexor, you may be able to compensate for medication by exercising regularly. This may also help manage withdrawal symptoms and keep you feeling good.Aim for a weekly total of 150 minutes of moderate activity, or about 30 minutes five days each week. Exercises such as walking, jogging, swimming, or biking can boost your mood.

Include prebiotic foods that also contain probiotics.,
Avoid foods that can harm the gut bacteria.",How to Take Antibiotics with Probiotics2," Prebiotics contain a type of soluble fiber that bacteria can digest. Prebiotics often contain inulin and fructooligosaccharides (FOS), which are present in many prebiotic supplements as well. Eat one type of prebiotic food every day and you should get enough prebiotics in your diet without the need to use supplements. Foods that are high in prebiotics include:Chicory root
Jerusalem artichoke
Dandelion greens
Garlic
Leeks
Asparagus
Wheat bran
Baked wheat flour bread
Banana

, You should eat vegetables every day, especially leafy green vegetables. These vegetables support the growth of healthy bacteria. They contain substances that bacteria use to produce anti-inflammatory substances and may even help prevent cancer. Include cruciferous vegetables such as:Broccoli
Brussels sprouts
Cabbage
Cauliflower.
Kale
Spinach
Swiss chard
Greens from mustard, collard, beet, and turnip plants

, Beans contain lots of fiber, but they also release short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). These SCFA strengthen and support gut bacteria. The SCFA also support the lining of your gut and improve the absorption of many nutrients. They may also help with weight loss.Include beans in your meals three to four times a week at a minimum.

, Some types of foods contain prebiotics and probiotics. Try to get four to six servings of these foods every week. These foods include:Sauerkraut
Kefir
Yogurt
Aged cheeses such as Roquefort, Bleu, Brie, Feta and Gruyére.
Curtido (a fermented salsa)
Kombucha
Kimchee
Pickles fermented in brine

, Diets high in certain types of foods can harm the gut bacteria and alter the numbers and types of bacteria in the gut. Evidence is growing that this sort of alteration of the gut bacteria, often called dysbiosis, may lead to all sorts of health issues.Foods to avoid include:


Animal fat
Antibiotic-fed meat and poultry
Sugar
Processed and packaged foods that include additives, preservatives, and sugar

Read the label to check for certain ingredients and features.,
Check the label for other important information.,
Take the supplements as directed.",How to Take Antibiotics with Probiotics3," If you do decide to try a supplement, make certain the probiotic contains many different strains of bacteria. Some strains to look for include L. acidophilus, L. Fermentum, L. rhamnosus, B. longum, and B. bifidum. Some products also include a yeast, Saccharomyces, which helps protect gut bacteria.Make sure that the supplement has at least 25 billion Colony Forming Units (CFUs). If you are looking for a prebiotic supplement that contains inulin and fructooligosaccharides (FOS), then the supplements should also contain galactooligosaccharides, or GOS.
Opt for controlled-release forms. Stomach acid can kill probiotic bacteria, so it is best to choose a probiotic that dissolves after it has passed through the stomach. This will help to ensure that the probiotics will be able to thrive in your digestive tract.

, Make sure that you check the label for an expiration date and also look for a “USP Verified” seal. The USP seal indicates that a non-profit lab, the USP, has checked the product and found that the bacteria and other ingredients listed on the label is what is actually in the bottle. Some other things to look for include:Company name and contact information
The recommended dose

, Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions on any supplement that you are taking. You can also ask your physician for advice. Since it may take a while for your body to rebalance the bacteria after you finish a round of antibiotics, it is a good idea to use probiotics for a month after you are finished taking the antibiotics."

Buy probiotics from a reputable supplier.,
Buy acidophilus with certain ingredients.,
Decide on a type of supplement.,
Drink acidophilus milk.,
Eat acidophilus-rich foods.,
Take acidophilus appropriately.",How to Take Acidophilus Probiotics2," When you are looking for the correct probiotics, you need to pay attention to the manufacturer of the product. Purchase probiotic supplements from a reputable supplier that guarantees its products. Suppliers may use independent organizations to test the quality of their products such as U.S. Pharmacopeia, NSF International, or Consumerlab.com. Although these seals of approval do not guarantee safety or effectiveness, the organizations do test products to ensure it contains what it claims to and that it is not contaminated.


The reason you have to be careful is because, although probiotics are considered dietary supplements, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve these products. They do, however, loosely regulate them. This means that although there are standards set for the manufacturing of dietary supplements and FDA may periodically check the facilities, there is a chance that your dietary supplement does not actually contain what it claims to or is contaminated.Each acidophilus supplement should come with a Colony Forming Units (CFU) count guarantee, which is based on the count at the time of manufacturing. Most acidophilus supplements contain between 1 to 2 billion CFU. Do not purchase products without CFU count guarantees.If the brand of probiotics you purchase is sold refrigerated, then ensure that your bottle has been and continues to be kept cool.

, Look at the ingredients in the acidophilus supplement. Some supplement manufacturers combine slow-growing acidophilus with other fast-growing bacteria to increase the CFU count and make it appear like a more effective product to consumers. You don't want to buy these because the other added bacteria may not be the kind of bacteria you need.


For best results, look for an acidophilus supplement that contains only acidophilus. The probiotic may be listed as acidophilus, lactobacillus or l. acidophilus., There are many different dosage forms available such as capsules, tablets, and powders. These supplements are used to treat certain conditions such as eczema and ulcerative colitis. Ask your doctor which form is best for your specific condition.


If a single-strain of probiotic doesn't seem to be working for you, consider a supplement with multiple strains. Just as one type of antibiotic works better than others for some people, the same is true with probiotics.
Tablets and capsules are typically made with freeze dried probiotics. Make sure you store them correctly by checking the container for directions. There are some forms of probiotic supplements that need to be refrigerated.
Powders can be prone to contamination because they are frequently exposed to air and a spoon or scoop, rendering them less effective., In order to get more acidophilus, consider drinking acidophilus milk. It is available through health food stores and some grocery stores. The milk has a tangy taste and a slightly thicker consistency than cow's milk. Unlike the advertised CFU strength in tablets, capsules, and powders, the amount of the supplement in the milk usually isn't verified.


This makes it difficult to know how much acidophilus you are drinking., If you aren't interested in trying the milk, yogurt and soy products contain natural forms of acidophilus. When choosing yogurt for its probiotic value, look for yogurt that contains live l. acidophilus cultures and no added sugars. Some fresh fruits and vegetables, such as carrots, also contain acidophilus.


Remember that while consuming foods high in probiotics is wonderful, we are unable to get enough of it from food alone. A supplement is always a great idea!

, In order to make sure your acidophilus is effective, make sure the supplement has not expired and has been stored correctly. Expired supplements or supplements that should have been refrigerated but were not may lose effectiveness. In addition, if you are taking other medications, especially antibiotics, take your probiotic 2 hours before or after taking them.Most of the time, it doesn’t matter when you take the probiotic, just make sure you take it routinely. Sometimes manufacturers may suggest taking it with food or taking it right before breakfast. Use the manufacturer's website or label to find out more information.

Treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).,
Prepare for antibiotic treatment.,
Use acidophilus for traveler's diarrhea.,
Fight a yeast infection.",How to Take Acidophilus Probiotics3," To treat your IBS, take acidophilus probiotic for 6 weeks. Choose a probiotic supplement, such as Proviva or Lacteol Fort, that contains viable lyophilized bacteria species including lactobacillus, bifidobacteria, and streptococcus. This can be taken in a drink or capsule form. When you are buying one, make sure the supplement contains 10 billion CFU of lactobacillus acidophilus. You should take this supplement twice per day.


Some people find it beneficial to take digestive enzymes along with probiotics to really heal the gut and provide help with digestion.
Acidophilus bacteria colonizes in the large intestine. It can help to repair damage due to IBS and help control diarrhea and constipation.
Taking acidophilus can cause additional gas or diarrhea for the first few days of treatment. The diarrhea should go away and your gas should be reduced after your body adjusts. See a doctor if you have diarrhea for more than 2 days and discontinue use of the supplement., You can use acidophilus to help prepare your body for the issues it goes through when you take an antibiotic. To counteract the side effects, take an acidophilus supplement containing lactobacillus when going on a course of antibiotics. This is necessary because antibiotics kill both harmful and friendly bacteria. You can recolonize the good bacteria through the use of at least 20 billion CFU per day, which is available in a products such as Culturelle.


Take the acidophilus 2 hours before or after you take an antibiotic pill. Antibiotics reduce the effectiveness of the active cultures, so staggering them with other pills will help., Sometimes when you go on trips, you suffer from traveler's diarrhea. To help prevent this, choose an acidophilus brand that does not break down under normal temperatures, as most acidophilus does, and one that doesn't need to be refrigerated. This will make it easier to take with you when traveling.


Take 2 billion CFU of a Lactobacillus GG supplement, such as Culturelle, for every day of travel to prevent traveler's diarrhea. Buy capsules that can easily be tucked away in your luggage., Since the vagina naturally contains acidophilus, you can use a supplement to treat some bacterial based issues that occur in that region. For vaginal yeast infections, acidophilus can be taken orally or with suppositories. Take 1 to 2 tablets of oral medicines such as Gynoflor. These tablets should contain at least 10 million CFUs per tablet and 0.3 mg estriol. Take this dose for 6 days, or according to package instructions.


You can also use a vaginal suppository, such as Vivag, that contains 100 million to 1 billion CFUs. Insert it twice daily for 6 days.
If you use vaginal suppositories, an increase in discharge most likely will occur."

Discuss with your doctor your reasons for wanting to stop taking Prozac.,
Ask your doctor to go over your discontinuation process with you.,
Document any effects you experience as a result of discontinuation.,
Take new prescriptions appropriately.,
Consider psychotherapy.,
Consider acupuncture.",How to Stop Taking Prozac2," Because Prozac can be prescribed for several different conditions, you should ask your doctor why she has prescribed Prozac for you.S/he may be able to recommend a different medication for your condition.


In some cases, your doctor may recommend that you stop taking Prozac if she feels that you are no longer at risk for (or no longer have) chronic or recurrent depression. If your doctor recommends this, it will usually occur after you have taken the medication for at least six to 12 months., Inform your doctor about any severe, continuing side effects from Prozac. If you have been taking Prozac for longer than eight weeks and do not feel like it is helping with your disorder, explain the symptoms you are continuing to see. This information will help your doctor make an informed decision and decide if the time is right to stop taking Prozac.

, It’s crucial to understand and follow your doctor’s recommendations exactly. Depending on how long you have been taking Prozac and its dosage, your doctor may or may not choose to taper your medication. Follow your doctor’s instructions to the letter to avoid serious side effects.


Prozac usually has fewer issues with discontinuation symptoms because it has a long “half-life.” Half-life refers to the time it takes your body to reduce the concentration of the drug by one half.A longer half-life such as Prozac’s means that the drug stays in your body longer. This means that the drug concentration in your body will not suddenly decrease, and this leads to fewer discontinuation symptoms.
If you have been on Prozac for a short period of time, such as six to 12 weeks, or are on a small maintenance dose (e.g., 20mg a day), your doctor may not recommend tapering your dose.
Keep track of your tapering schedule. Write down the date and the dosage you took each day. This will help you ensure that you’re following your doctor’s orders.

, Even if you are tapering Prozac, it is still possible to experience discontinuation symptoms, such as those mentioned elsewhere in this article. Talk with your doctor if you develop any discontinuation or other unusual symptoms.


Remember that your depression may reoccur as you discontinue your medication. Keep your doctor informed about how you are feeling. If you have concerns about a relapse, consult your doctor for advice.
Keep your doctor informed of your progress whether or not you experience any symptoms. Your doctor will monitor you for at least a few months after discontinuation.

, Your doctor may prescribe a different medication to control your depression or disorder. Be sure to take it as recommended by your doctor.Your doctor’s recommendations will include your own preference, prior response to medication, effectiveness, safety and tolerability, cost, side effects, and drug interactions with other medications you are taking.
If Prozac did not adequately control your depression, your doctor may recommend a medication in the same class of SSRIs, such as Zoloft (sertraline), Paxil (paroxetine), Celexa (citalopram), or Lexapro (escitalopram).
Other classes of medication the doctor may try if you experienced side effects or inadequate control of your depression include:

Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) such as Effexor (venlafaxine)
Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) such as Elavil (amitriptyline)
Aminoketone Antidepressants such as Wellbutrin (bupropion)



, Several studies show that people who see a therapist while discontinuing their antidepressant are less likely to have a depression relapse.Therapy can help you learn to deal with unhealthy thoughts and behaviors. It will give you tools to manage your stress, anxiety, and responses to life. There are many different types of therapy, and treatment plans will depend on your individual situation. Your doctor may be able to recommend a therapist in your area.Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has a strong record of effectively managing depression. Its goal is to help you learn to think more positively and challenge negative thoughts and behaviors. A cognitive-behavioral therapist will help you identify unhelpful thinking habits and change inaccurate beliefs. These can help reduce depressive symptoms.
Other therapies include interpersonal therapy, which focuses on improving communication patterns; family therapy, which helps resolve family conflicts and improve family communication; or psychodynamic therapy, which focuses on helping the person gain self-awareness.
You may need to try a few types of therapy (or a few therapists) before you find one that suits you best.

, Although it is not part of the official guideline recommendations for discontinuing medications or treating depression, acupuncture may be useful for some people.Acupuncture is a technique that inserts thin needles into various areas of the body to relieve symptoms. It should only be done by a trained, licensed practitioner. Consult your doctor if you are considering acupuncture. Your doctor may be able to recommend an acupuncturist. Acupuncture may not be appropriate for everyone.


One study suggests that electroacupuncture, which runs a mild electric current through acupuncture needles, is as effective as Prozac in reducing depressive symptoms, and may even work faster.The National Certification Commission  for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine is the licensing organization for acupuncturists in the US. You can use their “Find a Practitioner” feature on their website to locate a certified acupuncturist near you.Keep your doctor informed about any acupuncture or alternative treatments you undergo. This information should be kept in your medical records. All your health care practitioners should work together to ensure you get the best care."

Eat well.,
Limit alcohol consumption.,
Exercise regularly.,
Follow a sleep schedule.,
Get some sun.,
Strengthen your support systems.,
Try meditation.",How to Stop Taking Prozac3," No diet has been shown to relieve or “cure” depression. However, eating a healthy, well-balanced diet will provide your body the nutrients it needs to help fight illness. Eat a diet that incorporates fresh fruits and vegetables, complex carbohydrates, and lean protein.Avoid heavily processed foods, refined sugars, and “empty” calories. These provide very few nutrients for the amount of calories you consume, which can leave you feeling hungry. They can also cause swings in blood sugar, which can affect mood.Eating foods high in B12 and folate may help regulate your mood. Liver, chicken, and fish are good sources of B12. Beets, lentils, almonds, spinach, and liver contain folate.Foods high in selenium may help with depressive symptoms. Good sources include Brazil nuts, cod fish, walnuts, and poultry.
Foods that are high in tryptophan can be converted by your body into serotonin when combined with vitamin B6.Tryptophan-rich foods include soybeans, cashews, chicken breast, salmon, and oats.Studies suggest that regularly consuming omega-3 fatty acids may help regulate your mood. Flaxseed or canola oil, walnuts, kale, spinach, and fatty fish such as salmon are good sources of omega-3s. Oils such as corn, soybean, and sunflower are not as high in omega-3s.You should check with your doctor before taking omega-3 supplements, as they may worsen some chronic illnesses. Dosage between one and nine grams daily may be helpful to improve mood., Alcoholic beverages should usually not be consumed while taking antidepressants. Even if you do not take antidepressants, watch your alcohol intake. It is a depressant and excessive alcohol can deplete serotonin.Heavy consumption of alcohol is also associated with anxiety and panic attacks.
A “drink” usually refers to a 12-ounce beer, 5-ounce glass of wine, or 1.5-ounce shot of hard liquor. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend no more than one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men. This is considered “moderate” drinking., Studies show that regular, moderate exercise — at least 30-35 minutes a day — boosts your body’s natural “feel-good” chemicals (endorphins). Exercise may also stimulate neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine. These may help relieve depressive symptoms.Regular exercise can improve mood in people who have mild to moderate depression. It can also be used as a support in treating severe depression. However, if you continue to experience depressive symptoms even with regular exercise, you should contact your doctor., Your sleep can often be disturbed by depression. It’s important to follow good “sleep hygiene” to ensure that your body is rested. Good hygiene steps include:Going to bed and getting up at the same time each day (even weekends).
Avoiding stimulation before sleeping. Activities such as exercise and things involving screens, such as TV or computer work, can disrupt your sleep patterns.
Avoiding alcohol and caffeine before bed. Even though alcohol may make you feel sleepy, it can disrupt REM sleep.Keeping your bed for sleep. Don’t do work in bed.

, Some types of depression, such as seasonal affective disorder, may benefit from getting exposure to sunlight. Research suggests that exposure to sunlight may affect your serotonin levels.A lack of sunlight may also increase your body’s production of melatonin, which can cause depressive symptoms.If you cannot get natural sunlight, consider purchasing a light therapy box. Talk with your doctor about what box will best suit your needs. Generally, it’s recommended that you use your light therapy box for at least 30 minutes every morning.If you are going outside for sunshine, make sure to wear sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15. Choose a “broad-spectrum” sunscreen., Keep a close relative or friend involved in the discontinuation process. She or he may be able to help provide emotional support or recognize signs of relapse. Tell this person about side effects or symptoms to watch out for.Throughout the discontinuation process, stay in touch with your doctor. Let him or her know about your status, feelings or symptoms.

, A Johns Hopkins review of studies suggests that 30 minutes of meditation daily may reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety.Mindfulness meditation has received significant scientific study and is well-supported for reducing depression and anxiety.“Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction” (MBSR) is a common type of training that may help.Meditation usually includes the following elements:Focus: Focusing on a specific object, image, mantra, or breathing
Relaxed breathing: Slow, deep, even breathing increases oxygen and reduces stress hormones
Quiet setting: Eliminating distractions


You can download several guided meditations online. MIT has relaxation and mindfulness meditation MP3s.The UCLA Mindful Awareness Research Center has downloadable or streaming audio guides for meditation."

Build a pillow fort or barrier.",How to Sleep After Shoulder Surgery," Managing your shoulder pain or soreness before going to bed makes it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep, which is important for your body's healing process to work at top efficiency. Applying an ice pack to your sore shoulder about 30 minutes prior to going to bed can reduce inflammation, numb the pain and provide temporary relief, which are all important factors in falling asleep soundly.Don't apply anything cold to your sore shoulder without wrapping it in a thin cloth or towel in order to prevent frostbite or irritation.
Keep the crushed ice or ice cubes on your shoulder for about 15 minutes or until the area is numb and you can't feel the pain as much.
If you don't have any ice, use a bag of frozen veggies or fruit from your freezer.
The benefits of cold therapy can last between 15 to 60 minutes, which is usually enough time to allow you to fall asleep.;
, Another important aspect of managing your post-operative shoulder pain before bedtime is taking your over-the-counter or prescription medication as recommended by your surgeon or family doctor.Regardless if it's a painkiller or anti-inflammatory, take the recommended dosage about 30 minutes before going to bed, as that should be enough time for you to feel the benefits and get comfortable in bed.


Take your medication with a little food before going to bed in order to avoid stomach irritation. Some fruit, toast, cereal or yogurt are all good options.
Never take medication with alcoholic beverages, such as beer, wine or liquors, because of the increased risk of a toxic reaction in your body. Instead, use water or juice, but not grapefruit juice. Grapefruit juice interacts with many different medications and it can significantly increase the level of medication in your system, which may be fatal.Most patients undergoing shoulder surgery require strong prescription narcotics for at least of few days and sometimes as long as 2 weeks., After your shoulder surgery, your surgeon or family doctor will recommend and likely give you an arm sling to wear during the day for a few weeks. Arm slings support the shoulder and combat the pulling effects of gravity, which aggravates post-operative shoulder pain.Wearing your arm sling during waking hours will reduce the amount of swelling and soreness in your shoulder at the end of the day, making it easier to fall asleep at night.


Wear the strap of the arm sling around your neck in the most comfortable position for your sore shoulder.
The arm sling can be removed for short periods of time if necessary, as long as your arm is well supported. Make sure to lie on your back when removing the sling.
You may need to go a few days or so without a shower if your surgeon insists on leaving your sling on the entire time. Or, keep an extra sling on hand that you can wear while you are in the shower, then put the dry one on after you are dry., Taking it easier during the day while your shoulder recovers is also helpful in preventing excessive soreness at night prior to going to bed.Wearing a sling makes it difficult to move your shoulder too much, but avoid activities that can jar your shoulder such as jogging, working out on a stair climber and rough housing with friends. Focusing on really protecting your shoulder for at least a few months if not a few months — depending on the type of surgery you've had.


Walking during the day and early evening is good for your overall health and blood circulation, but take it slow and easier.
Remember that with a sling on, your balance will be affected, so be careful of falls and accidents which can further inflame your shoulder and make it more difficult to sleep.

, In addition to wearing your sling during the day, consider also wearing it at night, at least for a few weeks. Keeping your arm in a sling while in bed can help your shoulder remain stable while sleeping.

With an arm sling snugly holding your shoulder in place and supporting it, you won’t have to worry about your arm moving and creating pain around while you're asleep.

Even when wearing an arm sling in bed, don't sleep on your sore shoulder because the compression can trigger pain and inflammation, which could wake you up.
Wear a thin t-shirt under the arm sling while in bed so the skin around your neck and upper body doesn't get irritated.

, The best position for most people with shoulder surgeries to sleep in is in a reclined position because it puts less strain on the shoulder joint and surrounding soft tissues.To get into a reclined position while in bed, bolster your lower back and mid back with a few pillows. Alternatively, try sleeping in a reclining chair (Lay-Z-Boy style) if you have one — it might be more comfortable than propping yourself up in bed with pillows.


Avoid lying flat on your back as that position is often the most irritating to post-operative shoulders.As your shoulder soreness / stiffness subsides with time, you can slowly lower yourself into a flatter (more horizontal) position gradually if it feels comfortable during the night.
In terms of time frame, you'll most likely need to sleep in a semi-reclined position for 6 weeks or more depending on the type of surgery you had.

, While you're in bed and in a reclined position, prop up your injured arm with a medium-sized pillow placed under your elbow and hand — you can do this with or without a sling on. Doing so puts your shoulder in a position that encourages good blood flow to the joint and surrounding muscles, which is important for healing.Make sure to keep your elbow bent and the pillow snug underneath your armpit.


Alternatives to pillows include cushions and rolled up blankets or towels. As long as it comfortably elevates your lower arm and isn't too slippery, it'll work fine.
Elevating the lower arm and causing some external rotation at the shoulder while in bed is particularly comforting for rotator cuff and labrum surgeries.

, While sleeping in your bed after shoulder surgery, even if in a reclined position, it’s important to not accidentally roll over onto your injured shoulder and damage it further.Thus, stack some pillows beside and/or behind your injured side to prevent rolling onto it while sleeping. Softer pillows typically work better than firmer pillows as a barrier because your arm will sink into them instead of rolling off of them.


It’s a good idea to line both sides of your body with softer pillows to keep you from rolling over either way and jolting your post-operative shoulder.
Don't use pillows covered in satin or silk because they tend to be too slippery as a support and barrier.
As an alternative, move your bed against a wall and sleep with your sore shoulder wedged gently against it in order to prevent rolling over.

It’s best to have an adjustable chair with support, but if this isn’t available, you can modify your desk space to make yourself more comfortable.If your chair doesn’t have back support, consider putting a pillow between your back and the chair to give your lower back extra support.
You can also use this pillow to hold in an ice pack to help further alleviate your pain.
A footrest may help to support your lower back further.;
, Having a properly adjusted chair can reduce the strain on your back. Adjusting your chair to the proper height for you may not only reduce the strain on your back, but also relieve your discomfort.You should adjust the height of your chair so that you can type with your wrists and forearms straight and parallel to the ground.A good way to judge if your height is correct is to see if your elbows are by your body and form an L-shape at your joint.Change the back position and tilt of the chair so that you're comfortable and your back is supported., Once you’ve adjusted the height of your chair, your feet should be resting flat on the ground. This can help keep your back in a neutral position and relieve your discomfort.You can use a footrest if necessary, which may also provide additional support for your back.Avoid crossing your legs, which can cause you to sit in less than optimal positions and contribute to your discomfort., Having your computer and its accessories close to you can help ensure that you are sitting properly and not having to contort your head and neck to work. This in turn can help relieve and prevent back pain.Your screen should be at eye level about an arm’s length away.Your keyboard should be 4–6 inches in front of you.Keep your mouse as close to you as possible so that you’re not bending your back in any way to reach it.If you have papers on your desk while typing, try attaching them with a clip to your computer screen. That way, you won’t be bending your neck to the side while typing.

, If you speak on the phone frequently, it may make you bend your head and neck in ways that cause you discomfort. Use a headset instead of the physical phone to help sit up properly., If you sit for long periods of time, it’s important to take breaks during the day. This will stretch out and relax your muscles, and may also help further relieve back pain.Take a five minute walking break every hour if possible. During your lunch break, considering going for a walk or doing some other type of activity to stretch and relax your back.
Another option at break time is to stand up and realign the body before sitting. When standing, gently squeeze the buttocks for 10 seconds. Keep the stomach tight and gently roll your shoulders back, and then let your shoulders relax. These movements helps to contract and activate muscles that may not get any work while sitting.

, Once you’re sitting comfortably, place an ice pack on the area of your back that is causing you pain. This may offer you some immediate pain relief and reduce inflammation that is exacerbating your discomfort.Keep the pack on the affected area for at least 20 minutes per session.Doing it for any less time may only cool your skin and not have any affect on your underlying muscle tissue.You can ice your back up to five times a day with at least 45 minutes in between treatments.If you are having a hard time keeping the pack on your back, try keeping it in place with a towel or some elastic wrap.

, Using heat on tense muscles not only can help relieve your pain, but may also relax your muscles. From heating pads to heat rubs, there are many different types of heat treatments that can help relieve your back pain while sitting at work.Fill a hot water bottle or get a heating pad and place it on your chair on the affected area.
Over the counter heat rubs may also help alleviate pain.

, Try taking an over the counter pain reliever. It may relieve your pain and also help control inflammation.Take ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen sodium, which are called NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs), to help relieve your back pain. You can also try taking acetaminophen.Ibuprofen and NSAIDs may also help relieve inflammation.Consider combining your ice pack with a pain reliever while you’re at work to get maximum pain relieving benefits.

, If pain relievers aren’t alleviating your pain, consider taking a muscle relaxant. Your doctor will need to prescribe a muscle relaxant, so make sure you speak to her about why you need them.Be aware that muscle relaxants can make you dizzy and sleepy, and may affect your performance at work., Massaging the area of your back causing you pain may help relax you and relieve any discomfort you have.You don’t need to do anything in-depth or complicated to reap the benefits of massaging your back.


Gently rub any area causing you discomfort if you can reach it.
Consider using a tennis ball to help relieve your pain. You can place the ball between your back and a wall or your chair and gently move back and forth to give yourself a massage.

, Stimulating acupressure points on your back may to help relieve pain. There are four points on the lower back that are associated with alleviating back pain.The acupressure point for back pain are located near the spine at about waist level and between the second and third lumbar vertebrae.Gently press on these points to help relieve your pain.
You can find the exact spots which to stimulate at http://acupressurepointsguide.com/most-important-acupressure-points-for-back-pain/


, Although it’s important to get up every hour to keep your back mobile, you can also perform low back stretches while sitting.

Sit with your feet flat. Reach over to the right and place both your hands on the arm rest.
Slowly pull your body to the same side, rotating until you feel a relaxing stretch.
Hold this position for at least 30 seconds. Repeat again two to three more times. Then repeat to the other side.

, The hamstring muscles can get tight while sitting. Performing dynamic stretches can help you keep them loose, reducing tightness in the back.

Sit with feet flat on the ground, looking straight ahead.
Slowly begin straightening your right leg for five seconds. Once the leg is straight, hold for a second and then gradually bring it back down for another count of five. Repeat repeat more times. Then repeat with the other leg.

Your doctor will be able to accurately gauge the severity of your injury, offer treatment, and get you started towards a quick recovery. If you have a hamstring injury visit your doctor before beginning any treatment or recovery exercise regime.


There are three grades of hamstring injury. Grade 1 is a strain, grade 2 is a partial tear, and grade 3 is a full tearing of the muscle.
Your doctor can tell you how long your injury may take to heal.
Initial treatment methods can be demonstrated by your doctor.;
, The first step in initial treatment of a hamstring injury is to rest the affected muscle. Keeping the area inactive will prevent further injury and allow the healing process to begin and continue without further complication. Avoid using the area any more than is necessary to allow it the proper amount of rest.Severe injuries may require you to use crutches.
Stay off the injured leg as much as possible.

, In addition to resting the injured hamstring it will also be important to regularly apply ice. By applying ice to the injury you will help prevent inflammation, swelling, and pain. Make sure you are applying ice often enough and properly to get the most of your initial treatment and speed along your recovery. Always warp ice in a towel to prevent frostbite.
Apply the ice for about 20 minutes at a time.
Use the ice every three to four hours for the first four or five days after the injury.

, After a hamstring injury the area will tend to swell and expand, resulting in loss of flexibility. Because of this it is important to compress the area and limit the amount it swells. Wearing a compression bandage will help keep the swelling to a minimum and reduce the effect the injury has in regards to range of motion and strength loss.Elastic bandages should be available at most pharmacies.
Wear the compression bandage around your thigh.
Do not wear the compression bandage too tightly. If you feel loss of sensation, numbness, or “pins and needles” in your leg, immediately loosen the bandage.

, Elevating your leg will work with the other steps of initial treatment to minimize the amount of swelling. Keeping swelling to a minimum is important when trying to reduce the amount of flexibility and strength lost. Always keep the injury elevated when resting and recovering.Putting a pillow under your leg is enough to elevate the area.

, Before you begin any recovery exercise program you will need to talk with your doctor. Your doctor will be able to judge if you are able to engage in such a program, which exercises are the best fit for you, and how you can avoid re-injuring the area. Talk with your doctor to learn more about your personalized recovery plan.


Your doctor will be able to tell you what level of exercise is appropriate for your situation.
Visiting your doctor will allow you both to better track your recovery.

, To recover as completely as possible, it is important that you begin rebuilding strength and flexibility as soon as you are able. Exactly how soon you are able to start retraining your leg will depend on how severe your injury was. Ask your doctor or physical therapist when you can begin your rehabilitation process.Resting your leg after injury will help it to heal. However, this period of rest will also result in lost flexibility and strength.
Generally, light recovery exercises can begin a few days after the initial injury or once pain has subsided.

, In nearly every case of recovery and rehabilitation you will be required to work slowly to regain the intensity you were used to. Trying to exercise too much, too quickly, will likely result in further injury, improper healing, or a slower recovery process.Stop any exercise immediately if you feel any pain.

, After a hamstring injury and a period of rest, you will likely have lost flexibility in the area. A great way to recover this lost flexibility is to begin stretching the injured muscle, working slowly over time to increase the range of motion. Try the following stretch to get started regaining flexibility in your injured hamstring:Place your injured leg on a flat surface that is around hip hight.
Keep your knee from bending and try to straighten out your leg along the surface.
Gently and carefully lean toward your toes.
When leaning forward keep your back straight and bend at the hips only.
Stop when you feel discomfort or pain.

, If your hamstring is especially tight or injured, you may want to try the seated hamstring stretch. This stretch will allow you to sit comfortably and extend your leg outwards, letting you gently and safely stretch your hamstring. Take the following actions when using this stretch:Sit down on any flat surface.
Gently extend the injured leg upwards, brining your foot into the air.
Move slowly and don't over-stretch your hamstring.
Pay attention to how your hamstring is feeling during this motion.
Feeling tightness in the muscle is normal. However, feeling pain while stretching is a sign that you have pushed to far.
Stop if you feel any pain or discomfort during the stretch.

, Laying down and stretching your hamstring can offer a deeper stretch than other methods. This method can help restore range of motion and help you return to a level of activity that you enjoyed before the injury. Try the following actions to stretch your hamstring while laying down:Lay down on a flat surface.
Raise your injured knee up, bringing it towards your chest. Stop when your knee and lower leg are straight up.
Gently begin to extend your lower leg upwards, attempting to bring your entire leg into a straight line that points up towards the ceiling.
Work slowly as you attempt to straighten out your leg at the knee.
Stop immediately if you feel any pain or discomfort.

, After your hamstring injury you will likely have lost some strength in the injured leg. Before you can safely return to pre-injury activity levels you will need to regain that lost strength. The chair drag is a simple exercise you can use to start recovering strength and getting you fully active again.Sit in a rolling chair.
Extend your injured leg outwards, placing your foot on the ground.
Use your leg and hamstring to pull yourself forward.
Continue dragging yourself around in this way to build up the muscle in your injured leg.
Stop if you feel any pain or discomfort in your hamstring.
Work slowly and carefully when doing this exercise to avoid further injury.

, Resting your leg and hamstring after an injury will result in lost muscle tissue and strength. The best way to regain strength is to start small and gradually work up to greater amounts of intensity in your workouts. Always start with very light exercise to avoid injuring the area again.Walking can be a simple exercise that can build strength and avoid further injury.
Riding a bicycle can be gentle enough and still allow you to build strength in your hamstring.
Stepping up onto a high step can target the hamstring and rebuild strength.

However, taking these medications while you're on anticoagulants may increase the risk of excessive bleeding. If you're taking blood thinners, it's best to seek out alternative over-the-counter pain relievers.Acetaminophen medications are generally safe to take with blood thinners, but they should not be taken in high doses, as this may damage your liver.
Ask your doctor about taking acetaminophen as an alternative to aspirin or NSAIDs.;
, Some prescription medications increase your body's ability to form blood clots. These medications can cause complications if you are currently taking anticoagulants to thin your blood and prevent blood clots.Common medications that may decrease a blood thinner's anticoagulant effects include, but are not limited to:


Carbamazepine (Tegretol) - an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer.
Phenobarbital (Luminal) - an anticonvulsant that also relieves anxiety.
Phenytoin (Dilantin) - an anticonvulsant.
Rifampin (Rifadin) - treats tuberculosis (TB).
Vitamin K - a vitamin that promotes blood coagulation.
Cholestyramine (Questran) - lowers cholesterol levels.
Sucralfate (Carafate) - an antacid used to treat ulcers.

, Just as some medications cause blood clots, other medications thin your blood. This can cause your blood to become too thin if you're already taking anticoagulants. Schedule additional blood tests with your doctor if you must take antibiotics, antifungals, or any other medication that's a known anticoagulant.Some common anticoagulants include, but are not limited to:


Amiodarone (Cordarone and Pacerone) - an antiarrhythmic used to correct irregular heart beat.Co-trimoxazole (Bactrim and Septra) - an antibiotic.
Ciprofloxacin (Cipro) - an antibiotic.
Clarithromycin (Biaxin) - an antibiotic that's also used to treat some ulcers.
Erythromycin - an antibiotic.
Fluconazole (Diflucan) - an antifungal.
Itraconazole (Sporanox) - an antifungal.
Ketoconazole (Nizoral) - an antifungal.
Lovastatin (Mevacor) - a cholesterol medication.
Metronidazole (Flagyl) - an antibiotic.

, Eating a diet rich in vitamin K can increase your body's ability to form blood clots. This can decrease the effectiveness of anticoagulants by reducing their ability to thin your blood and prevent blood clots.Green leafy vegetables like spinach, kale, collard greens, and lettuce are all rich in vitamin K and may alter the effectiveness of blood thinners.
Cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and asparagus, are all high in vitamin K and should therefore be avoided.
Other vegetables that should be avoided or consumed in limited quantities include frozen peas and okra.
Talk to your doctor and/or a nutritionist about eating a balanced diet that won't impact the effectiveness of your medication.

, Some herbs act as natural blood thinners. If you consume these herbs while taking anticoagulants, your blood may become too thin. This can cause excessive bruising and bleeding, which may lead to further complications.Avoid herbal teas.
Avoid taking herbal supplements, including (but not limited to) alfalfa, clove, echinacea, ginger, gingko Biloba, ginseng, green tea, and St. John's wort.

, Nicotine can increase your risk of developing blood clots and cardiovascular disease. Alcohol can make some blood thinners less effective. It can also cause stomach bleeding, which may be excessive due to the anticoagulants.Work with your doctor about putting together a plan to quit smoking or drinking if you currently consume nicotine or alcohol on a regular basis.

, Many vitamins and supplements affect your body's ability to produce blood clots. If taken with anticoagulants, these vitamins and supplements may cause moderate to severe medical complications.Do not take vitamins that contain more than the daily recommended intake of vitamins A, E, or C if you're taking blood thinners.
Fish oil, garlic oil, and ginger supplements should all be avoided.
Onion and garlic extracts are commonly sold as supplements, but they may affect your INR and should therefore be avoided.

, People who travel for long distances, typically defined as a trip lasting more than four hours, may be at an elevated risk of developing a blood clot. This includes travel by car, bus, train, or airplane.If you're taking blood thinners, your doctor may advise you to change your medication schedule to prevent the risk of blood clots during travel.

, While taking blood thinners may increase your risk of bleeding if you are injured, it is necessary to stay on these drugs to avoid other serious complications, such as a stroke, pulmonary embolism, or myocardial infarction. Make sure that you continue taking your medication unless your doctor advises you to stop taking it., Because anticoagulants decrease your body's ability to form blood clots, your risk of excessive bleeding is significantly higher. You can reduce your risk of injury by minimizing your contact with sharp objects and avoiding contact sports/activities.Exercise extreme caution while using knives, scissors, and razor blades. You may want to consider switching to an electric razor if you shave any part of your body.
Be cautious when you trim your fingernails and toenails to prevent excessive bleeding from your cuticles.
Stick with low- and non-contact activities like swimming and walking.
Talk to your doctor before beginning any new exercise regimen or sport/activity.
You can also discuss your medication options with your doctor to find one that poses the lowest risk of excess bleeding if you are injured.

, If you are taking anticoagulants, you'll need to exercise great caution to avoid injuring yourself. This includes taking precautions when you're doing work around the house or simply traveling in your community.Wear a protective helmet anytime you roller-skate, skateboard, or ride a bike or scooter, or choose a safer activity.
Choose shoes and slippers with non-skid soles to reduce the risk of falling.
Make sure you wear shoes and gardening gloves any time you do yard work. You can also wear protective gloves when you handle sharp tools to prevent injury.

, You may not think of brushing your teeth as a dangerous activity, but if you're taking anticoagulants your gums could bleed excessively. You can take precautions against this by treating your gums gently and making minor changes to the ways you clean your teeth.Use a soft-bristled toothbrush to reduce the risk of injuring your gums.
Avoid toothpicks. Instead, clean your teeth by carefully using waxed dental floss.

, If you're not getting your blood levels checked regularly by a doctor, there's a risk that you could be taking too much or too little of your medication. In the case of blood thinners, taking too high a dose carries a risk of excessive bleeding and bruising.You will have to get your blood levels checked regularly for certain drugs, such as Warfarin. Weekly lab work will help to ensure that the medication is working properly and it can also prevent overdose or sub-therapeutic levels.
Excessive bruising, bleeding gums, nosebleeds, heavy menstrual bleeding, and prolonged bleeding from minor injuries are all common problems associated with taking too high a dose of blood thinners.
Have your blood tested regularly by your doctor and inform your doctor if you experience any excessive bleeding or bruising.

, Some blood thinners are not safe to take if you are pregnant or plan on becoming pregnant. They may carry an elevated risk of fetal bleeding and birth defects. For this reason, doctors typically recommend that women who plan on becoming pregnant switch to a blood thinner that will not cross the placenta and affect the fetus. This switch should be made prior to becoming pregnant.Warfarin (Coumadin), a common blood thinner, is not safe to take during pregnancy.
Heparin, another common blood thinner, will not cross the placenta and is therefore considered generally safe to take during pregnancy.

, Your doctor will need to know about any changes you make to your diet or exercise regimen. You should also inform your doctor of any vitamins or supplements you're considering before you begin taking them.


Check with your doctor to see if any activities you're considering would increase your risk of injury.
Your doctor will also be able to tell you if the vitamins and supplements you're considering would alter the effectiveness of your anticoagulants.

, If you're taking anticoagulants, it's important that you have your blood tested regularly. Your blood's clotting ability is measured and reported in International Normalized Ratio, or INR. Without regular testing, your doctor will not know if you are taking the correct dosage of blood thinners.Ask your doctor how frequently you should get tested. Certain factors like travel and dietary restrictions may increase the frequency of your recommended INR tests.
If you are receiving the right dosage of blood thinners, your INR should fall somewhere between 2.5 and 3.0.
An INR below 1.0 means that you are not receiving any effects from your anticoagulants. An INR above 5.0 is very dangerous and should be reported to your doctor immediately.

, In addition to keeping your doctor informed, you should also communicate your medical situation to your pharmacist. Occasional errors in how prescription medications are dispensed can cause serious, potentially fatal complications.Alert your pharmacist to the fact that you take blood thinners.
Check your medication each time you pick up a prescription. Make sure it's the correct prescription and read the label to see if blood thinners would react adversely.

, If you experience a sudden emergency and are treated by an EMT or an emergency room physician, your medical records may not be immediately available. To prevent the risk of an adverse drug interaction, you may want to carry some type of laminated ID or wear a medical bracelet to alert emergency workers to the fact that you take anticoagulants."

Don’t stop Remicade because your condition is in remission.,
Ask your doctor whether you can go back on Remicade.,
Make a plan for treatment without Remicade.,
Make a schedule to taper off.,
Monitor yourself for side effects.,
Tell your doctor if you think you may be pregnant or are planning to get pregnant.,
Reconsider Remicade if you develop a serious health condition.",How to Stop Remicade Treatments," Some conditions, like Crohn’s disease, will have periods during which symptoms seem disappear or go into remission, but the condition is still present. Stopping your medication during these periods may cause your condition to flare up again. Talk to your doctor before stopping Remicade, even if your symptoms seem to have subsided and you are feeling well.The manufacturer recommends staying on a maintenance dose of Remicade even when you are in remission to prevent symptoms from coming back.
The maintenance dose and frequency will vary depending upon your condition.;
, According to the manufacturer, when patients stop taking Remicade, their bodies sometimes produce antibodies against Remicade. This can make it less effective in the future.Ask your doctor if she expects that this would occur to you if you tried to go back onto Remicade after stopping.
Your doctor may be able to tell you how often this occurs to patients that restart Remicade and how severely reduced the effectiveness of the medication is.

, If you have a serious condition, talk to your doctor about what you will do if your condition worsens. Stopping Remicade will not produce withdrawal symptoms, but it is important that you be monitored to make sure your condition does not get worse. Questions to ask your doctor include:


What signs should you look for to make sure that your condition is not coming back?
How will the doctor monitor your health after you stop Remicade?
Are there other medications or lifestyle changes you can make to keep your condition in remission?
If your condition becomes active, are there medications you can use to treat it without Remicade?
Does your doctor recommend decreasing the Remicade gradually and then starting another medication?

, Chances are your doctor will not recommend suddenly stopping. Your doctor may be concerned that stopping suddenly may increase the likelihood that your condition will flare up again.


Ask your doctor for recommendations on how to taper off. Your doctor may suggest spacing out your doses further and further until you no longer need it.
Or alternatively, your doctor might recommend gradually lowering the doses.
What your doctor feels will be right for you will depend upon your particular situation. You should work with a doctor to determine how to stop Remicade.

, If Remicade produces side effects you should contact your doctor or nurse immediately to discuss whether the medication is right for you.

Not everyone experiences side effects, but in some people they may be severe enough that it is necessary to stop the medication. Possible side effects include:Stomach pain, vomiting, or nausea
Fever, flushing, or chills
Coughing, stuffy or runny nose, sneezing, or sore throat
Fainting, dizziness, tiredness
Difficulty breathing
Chest pain
Headache or muscle pain

Consider whether acidophilus yogurt or milk is right for you.,
Choose acidophilus tablets.,
Select capsules of acidophilus.,
Take acidophilus powder.,
Check the labels on capsules and tablets for different strains.,
Look for a guarantee on the supplement label.",How to Select an Acidophilus Supplement," If you prefer to get acidophilus from a dairy product, there are many on the market. However, a probiotic yogurt or milk may contain other strains of good bacteria in addition to acidophilus. Look at labels carefully and make sure L. acidophilus is listed.;
, These come in chewable form and are good for children and adults who have difficulty swallowing pills. Tablets contain between 1 and 2 billion units of acidophilus and can be taken up to 3 times daily.

, Capsules contain between 1 and 10 billion units of acidophilus bacteria, and can be taken up to 3 times per day with a glass of water. Capsules are the most common form of acidophilus due to their ease of use.


Consider coated capsules in cases of stomach upset. If you have been taking antibiotics for an infection and have gastrointestinal problems such as stomach upset or diarrhea, an enteric coating on the capsules may help to ease the symptoms of stomach upset. Enteric coating allows for the pill to dissolve in the intestine rather than in the stomach, which could cause irritation.

, Powder is preferred by people who do not care for pills, or who choose to take acidophilus with food. Powder can be sprinkled on foods or added to milk or juice. It is recommended that you take 1/4 tsp. (1.23 ml) of acidophilus powder daily, once each morning.

, Like yogurt, acidophilus supplements often contain multiple strains of bacterium in addition to acidophilus. If you wish to take only acidophilus, check labels.

, The product will have a guarantee if it contains at least 1 billion units of L. acidophilus. Without a guarantee, the supplement may still contain strains of good bacteria, but not necessarily acidophilus.

Download a medication reminder app.,
Buy a dedicated smart watch or similar device.,
Set up a phone call reminder service.,
Use an automated pill dispenser.",How to Set Medication Reminders Using Technology1," The widespread adoption of smartphones, tablets, and other mobile technology has resulted in an explosion in the number of applications available for download. Hundreds if not thousands of these are medication reminder apps.A 2013 research study tested and ranked 160 medication adherence apps, and chose three “best bets” based on features and functionality.Without endorsing any one product, one of the most popular apps, MyMedSchedule (http://www.mymedschedule.com/), offers email and/or text reminders, health tracking capabilities, printable schedules (to take to the doctor’s office, for instance), and many other features.
When choosing an app, look for features that appeal to you, but make sure that the actual medication reminder feature is particularly suited to your needs.;
, Wearable technology has become more popular recently, but some people may be intimidated by or not interested in multi-function devices that they deem too complicated. There are, however, simplified smart watches and similar devices that are designed and marketed specifically for medication management.Such devices are advertised as simple to program and use, even for technophobes, the elderly, and those with memory problems. They can be programmed with vibrating alarms and messages indicating when and which medication(s) to take.If you or the person requiring assistance is more comfortable with single-function technology, these watches may be a better alternative than a full-function smart watch.

, If the person who would benefit from medication reminders does not have a smartphone or is generally less tech-savvy, you have the option of utilizing traditional landline or simple cell phones to provide set reminders as well. Multiple companies provide internet-based phone reminder services that will provide personalized calls at the correct time.Say, for instance, that you sign up for one of these programs in order to remind your mother-in-law to take her heart pills. You can record personalized messages that will play when she picks up the phone at the designated time(s). Also, if she does not pick up the phone when called, you will be notified., Even people with good memory skills can lose track of which bottles they’ve opened and pills they’ve taken when on multiple medications. Simple multi-compartment pill dispensers, or dosing schedule-based blister packaging prepared by your pharmacy, can be smart options. For even more assistance, however, automatic pill dispensers may be the right choice.You (or someone else) pre-load the automated dispenser with your medications based on your dosing schedule. When it is time to take your pill(s), the dispenser will open, alert you with an alarm or similar notification, and provide only the correct pills.

Add your medication regimen to your digital calendar.,
Set alarms on watches, clocks, phones, etc.,
Call someone who requires reminders.",How to Set Medication Reminders Using Technology2," If you’re already using the calendar feature of your digital device(s) to keep track of business meetings, salon appointments, and birthday parties, why not add medication reminders to the list? Even with minimal tech skills, you should be able to add time-specific reminders and synchronize them across your devices.


With or without using the calendar function, you can set reminders on phones and digital devices that run on various operating systems.
Don’t just assume that you have a good memory and surely will be able to remember to take a couple of pills every day. It is surprisingly easy to forget amidst a busy daily schedule.

, Whether you prefer a smartphone or an old-fashioned bedside clock, most of us are familiar with using alarms to wake up. Well, if you can set an alarm to signal rise-and-shine-time, you can also set one to remind you that it is time to take your pills.


Most digital clocks and watches, and all cell phones, will permit you to set multiple alarms per day. Set them to coincide with your medication schedule — for instance at 8 am, 2 pm, and 8 pm.
If you have difficulty remembering not just to take your pills, but which pills to take, you should not rely on this method alone.

, It may be a bit annoying to call your Uncle Joe with the same “take your pills” reminder every day, but it is a simple, cheap, direct, and effective way to improve the odds of medication compliance. This may also be the best method if the person requiring assistance is an extreme technophobe, and wants nothing to do with fancy cell phones, the internet, or newfangled pill machines with (literal) bells and whistles.


Keep in mind how important medication adherence is to overall health. Thousands of people go to the hospital and billions of dollars are spent each year because of medication non-compliance."

Cut back or eliminate all drinks with large amounts of caffeine in them.,
Reduce the amount of processed foods in your diet.,
Make sure you're getting enough water.,
Try out rhodiola when your cortisol is high.,
Get more fish oil into your diet.",How to Reduce Cortisol1," This includes all sodas, energy drinks, and coffee. Drinking caffeine causes a spike in cortisol levels. The good news, if there is any, is that cortisol responses are reduced, but not eliminated, in people who drink caffeine regularly., Processed foods, especially simple carbohydrates and sugar, cause a spike in cortisol.Too many processed foods increase blood sugar levels, which in turn causes you to feel anxious.


The followingrefined carbohydrates are definitely things that you should try to avoid:

White bread
""Regular"" pasta (not whole wheat)
White rice
Candies, cakes, chocolates, etc.



, One study has found that just a half-liter of dehydration can raise cortisol levels.Dehydration is nasty because it's a vicious cycle: stress can cause dehydration, and dehydration can cause stress. Make sure you sip plenty of water throughout the day to cut back on your chance of unhealthy cortisol levels.


If your urine is darker colored when you go pee, it's probably a sign that you're not drinking enough water. Adequately-hydrated individuals have urine that is light, almost water-like, in appearance.

, Rhodiola is an herbal supplement related to ginseng, and a popular folk remedy for lowering cortisol. It reputedly ramps up your energy, helps you burn fat, and lowers your cortisol levels while it's at it.

Know the parts of the prescription.,
Understand how to read the drug name.,
Read the dosage information correctly.,
Learn the abbreviations for dosage methods.,
Decipher how you should take the medication.,
Look for refills.",How to Read a Doctor's Prescription1," There are certain pieces of information that your doctor will always include on a prescription. The doctor's professional information, such as her name, address, and phone number, will be at the top of the form. In the upper section of the prescription sheet, there will be a place for your name, your age or birth date, your address, and the date the prescription is given to you. Below this, your doctor will write the relevant drug information.This will include the medicine she is prescribing, the dosage, how many pills to take per dose, and how each dose should be taken.
There will also be information for the pharmacist about how much of the medicine to give you when your fill it the first time and how many times you can refill it.
Your doctor will also sign and date the bottom to verify that it was prescribed by a professional.
If the prescription is for a controlled substance -- one that the government has decided has the potential for ""abuse or dependence,"" such as morphine or methadone -- certain additional requirements must be included. The form must stipulate the number of refills (if any) and must be written in ink or typewritten. It must be manually signed by the prescribing physician.The prescription form will vary depending on what your doctor uses. For example, there may be boxes that she fills in for number of refills or it may be generated by a computer. Regardless of how it is written, the same basic information must always be written on the prescription form.Many practitioners will now send prescriptions electronically to the pharmacy of your choice. This is considered easier and more convenient by many practitioners, and also may reduce the chance of an error.;
, The main purpose of your prescription is to let the pharmacist know what drug you need in what concentration. Don't worry if you don't recognize the name of the drug. Typically, your doctor will write out the generic name for the drug. This is because the brand names for drugs can be spelled similarly and it might cause confusion or error at the pharmacy.If your doctor wants you to take a particular brand of medicine, she can write a note to your pharmacist that indicates this need. It will say something along the lines of ""no substitution"" or ""brand name medically necessary.""
There might also be a box on the prescription somewhere that indicates if your doctor prefers the generic or brand name version of the medication.

, The number behind the name of the drug is the amount you should take per dose. It will vary depending on the type of medication that you are taking. For example, most pills will be in milligrams, but measurements can also appear in grams or micrograms. The doctor may write out the full word for this or she may write the abbreviations. The abbreviation for milligrams is mg, g is for grams, and mcg is for micrograms.


If you are taking a liquid medicine or medicine by syringe, the dosage information will be in milliliters. The abbreviation for this is ml., On your prescription, the line underneath the drug and dosage concentration will be the instructions on how many doses you should take at one time and the method that should be used to take the medication. The main problem with being able to read these is that typically, doctors use medical shorthand, some based on Latin phrases, that you are not able to understand unless you have a medical background.


For the number of doses to take at one time, the doctor might write an i for the number of doses you need to take at a time. For example, if you are supposed to take 3 pills per dose, your doctor might write iii on your prescription. She may also write sig, which means to take it as it is labeled to be taken. There are other doctors, however, who will just write what you are supposed to have, such as ""1 tab,"" which indicates how much you should take.After the amount per day, the doctor will write how to administer your medication. Each method has an abbreviation that is Latin based. Po means to take it orally, pr means per rectum or suppository, sl means sublingual or under the tongue, IV means injected into the vein, IM means injected into the muscle, and SQ means subcutaneous or under the skin.

, Next to the dosage methods, the doctor will write an abbreviation for how often you should take your medication. This describes the number of times a day or week you should take your medication. Next to this, she will write any special circumstances under which you should take the medication. This will indicate things such as the need to take the medication with food.


The description of how often you should take your medicine is abbreviated using Latin phrases just like the method. Qd means every day, od means once daily, bid means twice a day, tid means three times a day, and qid means four times a day. The abbreviation qam means every morning, qpm means every night, q2h means every 2 hours, qod means every other day, and hs means at bedtime.
Any special instructions are also abbreviated based on Latin phrases. Pc means after meals or not on an empty stomach, ac means before meals, qhs means each night, and prn means as needed.Some doctors will write how often it should be taken instead, such as writing ""daily"" next to the dosage information. For controlled substances such as pain killers, she may write out the reason for taking the medication, such as the phrase ""pain"" if you need certain medications after surgery or for a chronic condition., Your doctor may authorize a certain number of refills for your prescription without needing you to come in for another examination or follow-up.

Prepare a pot of hot black tea.,
Try meditation techniques.,
Watch a funny movie or listen to a funny story.,
Try adaptive exercises to target a lowering of your cortisol.,
Listen to some tunes.",How to Reduce Cortisol2," Scientists have discovered that drinking black tea was found to lower overall cortisol levels in a group of people performing stressful tasks.So next time you feel the cortisol bubbling up and threatening to unleash itself in a torrent of stress, grab a cup of English breakfast tea and zen out.

, Meditation activates the Vagus nerve, which triggers a response in your body to lower cortisol levels, among other things.Meditation techniques can run the gamut, from taking deep breaths to allowing your mind to wander to a peaceful place. For best results, participate in meditation for 30 minutes a day, three to four times a week. After the first session, you should see a significant difference in how your body feels.


Sit in a quiet, dark, room. Allow your mind to meditate. If you need help relaxing, visualize a quiet, peaceful place. Imagine how your body feels when it is relaxed. Try to recreate this feeling within your body. This helps to relieve muscle tension within the body.
Allow the eyes to close. Take deep breaths in and out until you notice your heart rate slowing down. Notice the beating of your heart and its sounds when you are relaxed. Imagine that all of the tension is radiating out of your body through your fingertips and toes. Feel the release of tension throughout your entire body.

, Joyous laughter can actually curb your body's production of cortisol, according to FASEB.So sidle up to a funny friend or remind yourself of a mirthful memory in order to lower cortisol.

, Exercise is a stress-buster, right? So wouldn't all exercise be beneficial in lowering cortisol? Not exactly. The problem is that running and other cardio exercises raise your heart rate, ultimately increasing cortisol.


Try yoga or Pilates for an adaptive exercise that burns calories, works your muscles, and lowers cortisol too.
Try other adaptive exercises using the Wii console, for example, to get your heart rate up without that unhealthy spike in cortisol.

, Music therapy has been shown to reduce cortisol levels in patients undergoing screening colonoscopy.So the next time you're feeling stressed or slammed, put on some soothing music and let it put a curtain on your cortisol.

Write out your questions.,
Ask for an explanation of the prescription.,
Request that the pharmacist review the prescription.,
Review the information your pharmacist gives you.",How to Read a Doctor's Prescription2," Before you go to the doctor, you should have some questions ready in case you get prescribed medication. You should ask about the medication you are taking and all the details involved in its administration. This includes questions about the name of the medication, how often you are supposed to take it, the manner in which to take it, what disease the medication is treating, and if there are any side effects you should expect to have. You can also ask about what to do if you miss a dose and when you should stop taking the medication. It's a good idea to write these out in advance so you don't forget them.You might also want to ask what taking the medicine will accomplish, if there is a less expensive alternative, or if there are any interactions with other prescribed or over the counter medications, dietary supplements, foods, or herbal supplements., When you visit your doctor, if you are not exactly sure how to read the prescription you are given, you can ask them to explain their instructions for the medication before you leave the office. Use the questions you prepared before you went to the office to understand more about your prescription. Make sure you fully understand any terms they use or any descriptions that you may not know the meaning of.


Make sure you write down the answers that give you so you will be able to compare this with what you get from the pharmacy. This way you make sure you are always taking the right medication in the right doses., One way to make sure that all the right procedures are followed in regards to your prescription is to have your pharmacist review it when you drop it off and when you pick it up. Mistakes can take place when a pharmacist reads the directions differently than what the doctor intended.


You can help prevent dangerous medication errors by double checking and asking the pharmacist to verify the prescription with your physician.If you have any questions about the prescription or the medication, ask your pharmacist.

, Once you get your prescription filled, you will get a pamphlet from the pharmacist that explains the medication you are taking, what side effects may occur, and many other medicine intricacies that you may have questions about it. The pharmacist will usually offer to explain the medication and answer any lingering questions you have about your medications.If you experience side effects or interaction effects, you should call your health care provider immediately to report them and ask for a confirmation of your intended prescription, as well as further instructions for taking the medication.

Consult with your child's pediatrician.,
Read closely on the amount of dosage.,
Read any additional instructions.,
Weave medications into your child's daily schedule.,
Avoid stopping any doctor prescriptions when your child ""feels"" better.,
Watch closely during travel.",How to Schedule Children's Medications," It is very important to get the specific kinds of medication from them for your child's illness. A doctor might prescribe medicine for a particular reason and another bottle for something else.


Double check with the pediatrician concerning OTC (over the counter) medications that can be purchased from any pharmacy or drug store. While it may look ""safe"" to do so, many products are considered to be ""multi- symptoms"", meaning it may assist a sore throat, runny nose, coughing, or stomach aches. These are not needed whatsoever if your child does not have more than one symptom.;
, Note down on paper the specific amount of each medication you need to give your child and how often per day. Time spans can be varied from every 4 to 6 hours, 6 to 8 hours, or every 12 hours. Directions can also state daily amounts, such as twice or three times a day, or different amounts depending on weight.

, Unless it reads that it needs to be given on an empty stomach, this is the true treasure to prepare and schedule medications at the same time that your child eats.

, Never make them the most important thing or have it affect what your child already does. Have them have a dosage when they are alert and awake first thing in the morning. By doing so, the medicine can work into their bodies as the day starts and you can also calculate later medications easier. Always try to administrator medicine to them before they sleep for the night, so that the antibiotics can flow into their system overnight. You might find this very convenient over than choosing to wake them up in the middle of the night just to give them medicine.

, It's always advisable to continue them to the specified time so that the antibiotics and medication has enough time to completely kill off the bacteria. Stopping prescriptions mid-way or when the child feels better may cause the bacteria to grow again.

, If you know that you're crossing timezones, consult with the pediatrician and discuss the best methods to accommodate time shifting, especially bedtime hours. If you're staying within the same timezone, stay on the same hours as you planned out, for the best convenience and organization.

Be aware of the risk of constipationf.Constipation is the number one most prevalent side effect of opioid medications, affecting 80% of people who are prescribed opioid drugs.,
Take daily stool softeners.Everyone offered an opioid medication will also be offered a daily stool softening regimen.,
Practice lifestyle strategies to keep your stool loose.In addition to medications, there are also a number of lifestyle strategies you can use to keep your bowels moving as easily as possible while on the opioid medication.,
Try other medical treatments if you continue to have problems.If the first line stool softening methods and lifestyle strategies are insufficient to keep your bowels moving at a healthy pace, your doctor may suggest other medical alternatives to help treat your constipation.",How to Reverse Opioid Side Effects1," It is for this reason that medical treatment is always offered for constipation upfront at the same time as the opioid prescription is initiated. It is also easier to treat potential constipation prophylactically (preventatively), as opposed to allowing it to develop into a serious problem which in turn can make it more difficult to resolve.;
, An example would be taking Docusate twice daily and Senna once daily in order to maintain your normal bowels.


Your doctor will adjust the doses and choices of your stool softening medications depending on how they are working for you.
The goal ultimately is to maintain your bowels at the same frequency that you were having them prior to starting the opioid.
For example, if your normal is one bowel movement per day, the goal would be to maintain this even after starting the opioid,
Your doctor will tailor your stool softening medications to help you achieve this goal.

, These include:


Eating plenty of fibre. Fibre helps to bulk up your stool and allows it to pass more easily. The recommended daily amount is 20–35 g/day.
Drink plenty of fluids. Staying well-hydrated with at least eight to 10 8-oz glasses of water per day (and more with exercise) is key to helping your bowels stay soft and mobile.
Get regular exercise. Staying physically active with at least five exercise sessions of 30 minutes or more per week helps not only with your overall health, but also with passing your stools and keeping your gut healthy.
Try moving your bowels after a meal. There is a natural increase in colonic motility after meals, which may help. Colonic activity appears to be highest in the morning, so try going to the bathroom right after breakfast. Having a cup of coffee or other beverage with caffeine at breakfast may help with this.

, These may include:


Milk of Magnesia
The addition of an ""osmotic laxative"" such as Polyethylene glycol
A medication called Methylnaltrexone for severe constipation
Enemas and suppositories may be recommended as a last resort

Know your options.,
Ask about generics.,
Ask about pill-splitting.,
Make sure you need the drug.,
Be extremely careful with herbal supplements.",How to Save on Prescription Drug Costs1," The pharmaceutical industry spends loads of money to market brand-name drugs. This includes television commercials targeted at people like you, but also outreach to doctors like your GP. Often, the result is pressure to go with a brand-name, even when it is not cost-effective or the best choice.


Don’t insist on a brand-name. Just because you’ve seen it on TV or in a magazine doesn’t make one drug better than another.
Question your doctor about your meds. The drug industry uses “direct-to-physician” marketing to convince doctors to prescribe its products. This can include meetings with comped meals and other give-aways. Some people consider these activities influence-peddling.Do ask your doctor about options. Say something like, “I trust your judgment, doctor, but can you tell me more? Do I have more choices besides X-drug?”;
, Patents for medical drugs last about 20 years. After this, other companies can make “off-patent” or generic versions. Generic drugs have all the same active ingredients as brand-name drugs at a fraction of the price. In other words, they work the same but will cost you between 30% to 80% less.In general, let your doctor know if you need to save costs or can’t afford a certain drug.
Your doctor might assume you can afford brand-names or that your insurance will cover it. However, you may be paying more out of pocket that way.
Be proactive and ask whether there are any generic versions available.

, Did you know that some pills cost nearly the same as those with twice as much dosage? Sometimes, a pill with 80 mg has the same price as a pill with 40 mg of the same drug. You might be able to opt for the higher dosage pills and then split the pills in half to save money.Be aware of the risks. Not all pills split safely and it is sometimes hard to get the right dosage. For this reason, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t recommend the practice.Ask your doctor whether a drug is safe to split. Many pills – especially time-release, coated, and capsule pills – are not. You can also consult with a pharmacist.
If splitting the pill is safe, ask your doctor to prescribe you twice the dosage that you need in order to split the pills on your own.

, Are you already on multiple drugs? Have you lost track of what the medications are for? Some doctors overprescribe, pure and simple, so be sure that you need a new script in the first place. Taking too many drugs can be costly but also put a great deal of strain on your body.Be wary if your doctor tends to write you a prescription for every new symptom you report.
Have your doctor explain the medicine’s purpose. Then ask her, “OK, but why do I need it?”
Be sure to ask about reactions with other drugs you’re taking. In certain combinations, drugs can become less effective or even dangerous.

, Home remedies and herbal supplements are not necessarily bad for you and may help with some of your health conditions. But be careful. For one thing, herbal supplements aren’t regulated in the same way that drugs are. You should also NEVER use them as a replacement for your meds or a way to save on drug costs.Ask your doctor about each herbal remedy to see whether it’s safe or not.
Also ask about possible drug interactions. Some herbal remedies can interact with prescription medications and cause adverse, maybe dangerous, reactions.
Again, don’t use herbal remedies in place of prescription drugs to save money.

Understand that nausea is the second most bothersome side effect reported with opioid use.It does not occur nearly as frequently as constipation, and hence does not require prophylactic (preventative) treatment; however, people who do get nausea with opioid use (approximately 25%) often find it the most challenging side effect to deal with.

,
Use an antipsychotic medication to combat nausea.Although it may sound strange initially, the mechanism of action of antipsychotic medications actually works not only in psychotic patients, but also as a means to reduce opioid-induced nausea.,
Treat nausea related to the inner ear differently.Some people on opioid medications get nausea that is directly associated to positional changes, or to certain motions that may throw off their equilibrium and balance.,
Use metoclopramide if your nausea is related to constipation.The last subtype of opioid-induced nausea is nausea that comes and goes in relationship to your degree of constipation.,
Opt for dexamethasone as a last resort.Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that has been shown to be effective in treating nausea; however, the mechanism of action (the way in which it works) is no completely understood, so it is generally not used as a first line treatment.",How to Reverse Opioid Side Effects2,", Your doctor may suggest that you try haloperidol (an antipsychotic drug) as a treatment for opioid-induced nausea. Other options to try include prochlorperazine or promethazine.

, This type of nausea is specifically related to the inner ear (as opposed to other people who have constant nausea with opioid use that is not related to the inner ear). If you notice that your nausea comes and goes in relation to positional changes, ask your doctor to try an anticholinergic medication such as scopolamine. This has been shown to be most helpful in treating nausea related to the inner ear.

, If constipation is the triggering issue for your nausea, metoclopramide is the best choice of treatment as it specifically targets nausea related to the gut.

, Speak to your doctor about trying this as an option if other medical treatment has not been effective in alleviating your nausea.

Be aware of other potential side effects of opioid medications.Opioids can lead to a variety of different side effects.,
Use an antihistamine to treat itchiness.About 10% of people taking opioids suffer from itchiness as a side effect.,
Try dose reduction.If side effects such as drowsiness are bothering you, reducing the dose of opioid medication you are taking may be your best bet.,
Opt for a different opioid medication.Another way to combat the side effects of opioids is to rotate through different drugs.,
Speak to your physician if you are suffering from sexual side effects.Because opioid medications may lead to decreased libido and difficulty with orgasm, it is important to seek help from your physician if you are finding that your sex life is negatively affected.,
Know that there is the possibility of addiction.Addiction to opioid medication is rare in people who have not suffered from other addictions in their lives; however, for those who have a history of street drug abuse or other addictions, the possibility is there.",How to Reverse Opioid Side Effects3," Although constipation and nausea tend to be the two greatest concerns, other side effects to be aware of include:


Drowsiness and reduced focus and mental alertness
Respiratory depression (a decreased drive to breathe due to the effect that opioids can have on the brain; this can be lead to death if the patient overdoses on his opioid medication)
Itchiness
Decreased libido and difficulty with orgasm
The possibility of becoming addicted to the medication

, Trying an antihistamine medication such as Benadryl can help to alleviate the itch, but it can have a sedating effect. You may also want to try cetirizine, which is usually used in for chronic itchiness and has less sedating effects. Speak to your doctor about this if itchiness is a problem for you.

, Doctors tend not to use stimulant medications to combat opioid-induced drowsiness, except in palliative (end of life) situations. The general approach is to see if the drowsiness subsides as your body gets used to the opioid medication and, if not, to reduce the dose.


Note that this is another reason that your doctor will start you on a low dose of opioid medication, and gradually increase the dose as needed. This gives your body time to slowly adapt to the medication, as many of the opioid side effects decrease with time as your body gets used to it.
Doctors also start with a low dose of opioid in order to prevent respiratory depression. They will monitor you at a low dose and ensure that your breathing is not negatively affected before increasing the dose, in order to ensure that you are not at risk of respiratory complications.

, There are many different opioid medications available, so switching to another one (and rotating which one you take) can help to decrease the side effects you are suffering from. Your doctor can also vary the route of administration of the medication, such as switching it from an oral pill to a transdermal skin patch; varying the route of administration can also help to diminish side effects.

, Dose reduction or switching opioids may be enough to reduce the problem; if not, your doctor or a sex therapist may be able to help you in other ways to reclaim your sex life.

, The greatest risk factors for developing a dependency on opioid drugs is having a personal history of addiction or a family history of addictive behaviors.


Speak to your doctor about the possibility of addiction or drug dependency if this is a concern for you.
Know that everyone develops ""tolerance"" to opioid medications, meaning that the effectiveness of the drug gradually reduces with time as your body gets used to it.
However, developing tolerance with time is not the same as developing an addiction.
Addiction is when your ability to regulate your own behavior with regards to obtaining higher doses of the drug gets out of control.
Do not use opioids chronically. Use pain pills only for short periods to control pain or relieve discomfort and use them as directed by your doctor.
If you do become addicted to opioid pills, reach out to a loved one, friend, or doctor. This intervention may get you the help that you need to recover from using these powerful drugs.

Shop around.,
Shop online.,
Learn to spot “rogue” pharmacies.,
Don’t switch pharmacies frequently.",How to Save on Prescription Drug Costs2," Prescription drugs vary a lot in price. We’re not just talking about by region or by country, either, but store-by-store in your area. In one study, the generic version of the antidepressant Cymbalta varied between $43 to $249 depending on the pharmacy chain. In other words, don’t be satisfied with the first price you see.Call around for quotes to get a sense of high and low-end prices in your area. Ask at each store, “Is this your lowest price?” Prices at pharmacies are often negotiable.
Prefer independent pharmacies to large chains like CVS or Walgreens, at least in general, as the latter tend to price higher. Walk-in pharmacies at box stores like Costco also fare well.
If you have insurance, don’t always use it. Oddly enough, large pharmacy chains sometimes sell common generics in discount programs or at bargain prices – so long as you pay out of pocket.

, It’s possible to save money by by-passing your local pharmacy entirely. Look online for good prices for your prescription meds with reputable websites like Healthwarehouse.com and others. However, be very aware that there are risks with online shopping.Many online “pharmacies” sell fake, adulterated, or expired meds. These can make you sick. Some websites are also scams that will try to steal your financial information or infect your computer with viruses.
Buying drugs online can also mean that the meds you take haven’t been held to strict rules and regulations. Or, they might be slightly different in terms of ingredients.
Only use retailers that are based in the US and bear the symbol VIPPS: “Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Site.”
You can check through the FDA that the pharmacy is properly licensed, as well., Many or even most online pharmacies that are based in other countries and advertise discounted drugs are not legitimate. Most companies that bill themselves as “Canadian” pharmacies are fakes that sell low-quality or counterfeit drugs, as well. Beware of these “rogues” and learn to recognize warning signs.Watch out for websites with prices that seem too good to be true or that send you spam and unsolicited emails.
Don’t trust companies that aren’t based or licensed in the US.

, While shopping around can save you money, try to avoid switching your pharmacy too often in your quest for the lowest price. Frequent switching can erode the checks and balances that keep you safe and can make a harmful drug interaction more likely.Pharmacies keep data on your prescription history. These databases help to flag possible negative drug interactions. However, the system is less likely to catch these if you are always moving around.
Too frequent switching may raise suspicions, as well. Be aware that prescription drug addicts often try many different pharmacies to pass off fraudulent scripts. You may not be doing anything wrong, but your behavior could raise eyebrows.

File an appeal.,
Apply for government or non-profit assistance.,
Approach pharmaceutical companies.",How to Save on Prescription Drug Costs3," An appeal is an option when your doctor prescribes you a medicine that is not covered by your prescription drug insurance. The thing is, insurance companies may legally have to cover medically necessary drugs if you can show that you need it. There is actually very little to lose by appealing.To appeal to your insurer, you’ll need to file a request with the drug information, your personal details, your reasons for filing the appeal, supporting documents, and proof of medical necessity from your doctor.
You’ll get coverage if the appeal is successful. If not, however, you can contact your state regulator and ask for an independent review. This process is free. Check your insurer’s written decision letter for information on your regulator.

, There are lots of programs to help people – especially with low income – pay for prescription drugs. Check online through programs like Medicare/Medicaid or organizations like AARP or Needymeds and see whether you qualify.Keep in mind that your citizenship status, income, and insurance coverage may affect your eligibility.
Try the Medicare Rx Extra Help program. You are eligible for prescription drug help if you earn less than $17,655 (single) and $23,895 (married). You can apply online with your social security number and recent financial records.Contact organizations like AARP or Needymeds to ask about discount cards and programs. These generally work for multiple drugs, but you can’t use them together with other insurance or government programs.

, One last idea is to try the drug companies themselves. Many offer deep discounts or free medicines to people in need. GlaxoSmithKline offers a discount card program with cuts of between 20% to 40% off its drugs’ list price. Other companies like Merck have similar programs.Talk to your doctor about these kinds of programs. You can print out application forms on your own from the internet or call the company directly and request them.
Fill out the forms as best you can and take them to your doctor’s office for completion – you will need the doctor’s signature.

Talk to your doctor before giving birth.,
Identify if you need medication.,
Take medication properly.,
Breastfeed before taking your medication.,
Pay attention to warnings.",How to Safely Take Medication While Breastfeeding1," Your doctor should know before you give birth if you’ve been taking medications – both over-the-counter and prescription medications. Communicate clearly and directly about medications you are or have been taking recently. Your doctor will be able to let you know if the drug is safe, unsafe, or probably safe, and advise you how to proceed accordingly.For instance, if you’ve been taking medication before giving birth, say to your doctor, “I have been taking medication.” Your doctor will then ask you what medication you’ve been taking. Provide your doctor with an honest reply.
Most medications are safe to take while breastfeeding.For instance, most antibiotics, diabetes medications, acid-reflux medications, and sleep aids are generally safe.;
, If you have pain following your birth, you might need to use medication to manage it. Certain medical procedures related to your birth – such as C-sections, cuts or tears in the vaginal area, or related surgeries – could necessitate pain medications. In these cases, your doctor will prescribe pain medication in doses that you can take safely while breastfeeding.If you’re taking medication unrelated to pain or surgery caused by the birthing process, ask your doctor if it’s safe to take. For instance, you might show your doctor the medication bottle and ask, “Is this medication safe to take?”
Ask your doctor if there are alternatives to taking medication that you might be able to explore.For instance, you might ask, “Are there alternatives to this medication that would achieve similar results?”

, Always take medication in the amount prescribed. For instance, if your medication recommends taking two pills twice each day, do not take three pills twice each day.Additionally, take medication as frequently as prescribed.For instance, if the medicine you’ve been prescribed directs you to take it twice each day, do not take it three times each day. Doing so would not be in accordance with the medicine’s directions.
Using medicine in a way that is not prescribed could be unsafe for both you and your new baby.

, The medication levels in your body – and, therefore, in your breast milk – will typically be at their lowest right before you consume another dose. Therefore, the best time to breastfeed your baby is right before taking your medication.While this is true in most cases, it is not true in every case. Always discuss the timing of your feedings relative to your medications with your doctor., Many medications cannot be safely taken with other medicines, even if they are over-the-counter medicines like Tylenol or Motrin. Read the warning labels on your medication carefully when breastfeeding."
"
Take the child’s health and age into account.,
Know when to contact your doctor.,
Use a breast pump if necessary.",How to Safely Take Medication While Breastfeeding2," Premature babies may be more susceptible to the negative side effects that may accompany a particular medication. Newborns and babies with other health problems are also at elevated risk for reacting badly to medication in breast milk. Older, healthier children whose immune systems and kidney functions are more robust are more likely to withstand the presence of a small amount of harmless medication in the breast milk.If your doctor suspects that your child’s age or health place them at an elevated risk of absorbing medication through breast milk, they will prescribe an alternative to medication.

, There are several occasions in which you should contact your doctor. If the medication you’re taking is not alleviating the severity or frequency of your symptoms, you should contact your doctor. For instance, if you’re on pain medication and your pain gets worse even while taking your medication, your doctor should know. Another case in which you should contact your doctor is when your symptoms actually get worse – that is, they increase in severity or frequency., If your doctor believes that your breast milk contains medication in concentrations that make it unsuitable for your baby, or if you are taking a medication that makes your milk unfit for the baby’s consumption, you should use a breast pump to remove the milk you’re producing. Once you’ve pumped the milk from the breasts, dispose of it safely by pouring it down the drain. This way, you can keep milk production up for when you stop taking a short-term prescription.Feed your baby a high-quality formula mixture during periods when you’re taking medication and cannot provide your baby with breast milk.
If you have concerns about the safety of a medication on the health of your baby, express your milk into bottles, label them with the date and time pumped, and refrigerate until you have confirmed whether or not it is safe. If it is not safe to use, dispose of it.
Breast pumps are also useful for pumping “good” milk – that is, milk that is uncontaminated by the presence of medications – before you begin a medication regimen.Pump enough milk for several days into bottles and label them with the date and time. Feed your baby this milk while you’re taking the medication.
There are two main varieties of breast pumps – manual and electric. Both are safe and easy to use. Follow manufacturer's directions when using your breast pump."
"
Monitor your baby’s sleeping schedule.If your baby is much sleepier than usual or tends to sleep through occasions like feeding or other times when it is normally awake, it might be getting too much medication through your breast milk.Most babies should sleep most of the day and night (about eight to nine hours each day and eight hours each night), but will not sleep for more than two or three hours straight at a time.Babies are all unique, however, and some won’t sleep more than a few hours daily.

,
Pay attention to your baby’s feeding habits.If your baby suddenly stops being able to suckle as well as it used to, it might be suffering side effects from your medication.,
Track your baby’s bowel movements.,
Keep an eye on your baby’s behavior.Baby behavior might change in response to medication received through breast milk.",How to Safely Take Medication While Breastfeeding3,", Similarly, if your baby seems uninterested in suckling at times when it normally would be, you should contact your doctor. For instance, if your baby was ready to breastfeed immediately after it woke up for several weeks in a row, then suddenly it loses interest in breastfeeding as soon as it wakes, you should contact your doctor., Constipation could be a sign that your baby’s digestive tract is being affected by medication in your breast milk. In other words, if your baby is not defecating regularly, you should contact your doctor and determine if you need to adjust your feeding habits or medication dosages.Babies who have diarrhea might also be suffering from medication-related side-effects.During the baby’s first few days, it will poop a dark-colored goo called meconium. A few days later the stool will become yellow, tan, or yellow-green in color.After the first few days, the baby will have two to five bowel movements every 24 hours.
After six weeks, the frequency of a baby’s bowel movements becomes harder to predict. Your baby might poop once every day or two, or it might continue to poop up to five times daily.

, If your baby becomes fussy, irritable, or exhibits other behavioral abnormalities, contact your doctor.For instance, if your baby is normally relaxed and happy after breastfeeding, but – after you begin a new regimen of medication – starts crying loudly in an especially shrill and unpleasant way, its behavior may be affected by medication it absorbed through breast milk.
Your baby might also become exceptionally tired after absorbing medication through breast milk. For instance, if your baby normally likes to crawl about and babble happily after consuming breast milk, but after you begin taking medication it immediately falls asleep, this changed behavior could be due to increased levels of medication in your breast milk.

Gather the oregano.,
Choose your oil.,
Crush the oregano.,
Warm the oil.,
Add the oregano.,
Infuse the oil for a few weeks.,
Strain the oil.",How to Prepare Oregano Leaves for Cough Medicine1," To make oregano oil, you need to first make sure it is completely dry. If there is any excess water or damp spots, it can cause mold or bacteria to grow in your oil. Gather the amount of oregano you’d like for your oil, such as ½ cup or 1 cup., When you make oregano oil, you will use a 1:1 ratio of oil to oregano. This means you will add the same amount of oil as oregano. If you have ½ cup of oregano, you need ½ cup of oil.


You can use olive oil, grapeseed oil, avocado oil, or almond oil., You should crush the oregano before you add it to the oil to help it start releasing its own oils. You can do this a couple of different ways. You can tear or cut the leaves with a knife.


You can also place the oregano in a plastic bag and smash it with a mallet or rolling pin.If you have a mortar or something similar, you can crush the oregano that way, too.

, Before adding the oil to the oregano, you need make sure it is warm. You can do this by placing it in the microwave, or place the oil in a glass container that you sit in hot water. Just make sure the oil is warm, and not too hot or boiling.Warming the oil helps the oregano and oil infuse better.
Alternately, you can place the jar in hot water after you place the oregano inside and seal the jar to infuse it. If you do this, leave the jar in the hot water for up to 10 minutes., Once you have warm oil, add the oregano and oil to a sanitized jar. Stir is around to mix the oregano fully. You can even massage the leaves if you want to help release their oils.Place the lid on the jar when the oregano is added.

, The oil needs to infuse for a few weeks. You want to let it infuse for at least two weeks. You can set it on a sunny windowsill to let the sunlight heat the oil to help it infuse.Make sure to shake the jar every few days.
Some people think letting it infuse longer is better for medicinal use. If you want to let it infuse longer, keep it infused for up to six weeks, but no longer. It could go bad., After the oil has infused for a number of weeks, you need to strain the oregano from it. Use a strainer or a cheesecloth to strain the oregano from the oil. Make sure to squeeze out all the oil in the oregano leaves.Place the oil in a sanitized jar or a dropper bottle. Store it in a cool, dark place.
You can also store it in the refrigerator.

Gather the ingredients.,
Boil oregano and garlic.,
Combine with honey.,
Steep overnight.",How to Prepare Oregano Leaves for Cough Medicine2," To make a natural cough syrup, you need garlic, oregano, and honey. You need ½ cup of honey, 2 cloves of garlic, and 2 sprigs of fresh oregano.You can measure out about one teaspoon to one tablespoon of oregano instead.


Garlic, honey, and oregano are antimicrobials that help naturally fight colds and coughs.
You can also add ½ cup of onion and one lemon if you want.

, Boil the garlic cloves and the oregano with about ½ cup of water. Boil for about five minutes., Let the boiling mixture cool for a few minutes, then pour into a cup with the honey. Mix together. Now, it is ready to drink.

, An alternate way to make this cough syrup is to let it set overnight. In a jar, put the oregano at the bottom, then the garlic, then lemon and onion. Pour the honey and water over the ingredients, making sure the water covers all the ingredients completely. Put the lid on the jar so it is airtight, and let it steep overnight. Strain the liquid the next morning and only drink the liquid.Store in your refrigerator for a week.
This makes an even stronger cough syrup because the garlic and onion (if you add onion) are stronger and have more medicinal properties if they aren’t cooked.

Know the medicinal properties of oregano oil.",How to Prepare Oregano Leaves for Cough Medicine3," The oregano cough syrup can be taken orally. Take a spoonful as often as you need for coughs or sore throats.Don’t give the cough syrup to children under a year old because of the honey.

, Oregano oil can be taken orally for any cold or cough symptoms. If you have a dropper, you can take two droppers full if you feel any cold symptoms coming on, including a cough.Another way to use oregano oil for coughs is to take three to five drops daily when you have a cough. You can put the oil in water, tea, orange juice, or directly into your mouth., Some people take oregano oil daily for a general boost. Most people believe you should only take it when you are sick. Oregano oil is considered a powerfully effective herbal remedy, so taking it when you feel a cold or cough coming on, and while you are sick, helps emphasize the effectiveness of the oil., Oregano oil is an anti-inflammatory, antifungal, and antibacterial agent. It also is considered a natural pain reliever.Oregano is believed to fight coughs, colds, congestion, sinusitis, allergies, arthritis, sore muscles, tooth aches, burns, ear infections, insect bites, and digestive issues like diarrhea."

Be more patient with your illness.,
Ask your doctor to distinguish between viral and bacterial infections.,
Get a second opinion.,
Explore natural (non-pharmaceutical) antibiotics with the help of a licensed neuropath.",How to Reduce Unnecessary Antibiotic Use1," As a patient, it can be hard to have an illness that's causing uncomfortable symptoms and lots of distress; however, many respiratory and intestinal infections clear up within a few weeks and are not life threatening. As such, take the time to assess your symptoms before visiting the doctor. This can help avoid unnecessary antibiotic use.The rule of thumb is to allow symptoms like mild fever, congestion, running nose and/or cough to run their course, usually about seven to 10 days. These symptoms are generally indicative of viral infection and can be treated with rest, hydration, and bland diet.
Be on look out for key symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, high fever, uncontrolled nausea/vomiting and/or diarrhea without being able to keep liquids down, which predisposes one to dehydration. These symptoms indicate you need to be seen by a heath care professional.
Postponing a doctor's visit for a few weeks in order to see how your symptoms progress is generally safe, as long as you're able to see your doctor quickly if the symptoms suddenly get worse.
Most unnecessary antibiotics are prescribed for viral respiratory infections — the common cold, viral sore throats, bronchitis, sinus and ear infections.The millions of excess prescriptions each year in the U.S. put patients at needless risk for allergic reactions, serious diarrhea and other intestinal problems, along with the most important risk — antibiotic resistance due to unnecessary exposure.;
, Be proactive and ask your doctor to make a diagnosis supported by laboratory results before recommending antibiotics or other medications to you.Doctors are experienced in dealing with infections, but the clinical presentations of bacterial and non-bacterial infections are nearly identical in many instances. They need to offer you justification for their recommendations.


It takes less time to prescribe antibiotics than to determine the cause of an infection, so be cautious with doctors who are in a big rush. Your health is more important than their schedules.
Ask your doctor about when antibiotics are needed and when they're not. Your conversation should include information on risk for infections by antibiotic-resistant bacteria., If you get the sense your doctor is pushing antibiotics on you without substantiated evidence (lab support) that you have a bacterial infection, then consider getting a second opinion from a doctor who is more diligent in getting an accurate diagnosis.Two professional opinions is almost always better than one for significant health issues.


Further testing may reveal a viral/fungal/parasitic infection and lead to the correct diagnosis and treatment, as well as reduced risks associated with antibiotic usage.
Politely ask your doctor for a referral or ask family and friends if their primary healthcare physicians are taking new patients.

, If you're concerned about the risks and ineffectiveness of antibiotics, there are natural alternatives to consider. There are many plant-based compounds that can kill bacteria (and other microorganisms) which are good and safer alternatives to antibiotics. Healthy and affordable choices include coconut oil, olive leaf extract, andrographis, Pau D’Arco and garlic.Talk to a naturopath or a practitioner of Chinese herbal medicine before taking any plant-based medicines, and check with a pharmacist to make sure they don't interact with any medications (even over-the-counter meds like aspirin) you may be taking.


Coconut oil contains lauric acid which can kill C. difficile — a strain of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and a leading cause of diarrhea in hospitals.
Andrographis is used in Indian folk medicine and can fight influenza and upper-respiratory bacterial infections.
Pau D’Arco is the bark of a South American tree that has both antiviral and antibacterial properties.
Garlic contains allicin, which can kill various ""superbugs"" such as VRE and MRSA.

Pressure from friends and family may push you into getting help, but, ultimately, the decision is yours., Treatment for alcohol addiction involves multiple approaches. Expect to work with a doctor, possibly a psychiatrist, a therapist, possibly a nurse, support systems, like family therapy, and mutual help groups, like AA. Choose treatment opportunities that suit you. Success is very possible, especially if you build several treatment approaches into your plan.Alcohol and/or drug abuse are sometimes present simultaneously with other mental health issues such as depression, and therefore it is important to see a mental health provider for a comprehensive assessment if you or someone you know believes you may have a problem with alcohol. You may need treatment for this other disorder as well as treatment for alcohol abuse.

, Somewhere early in this process, you will be asked questions about your drinking habits. Be honest with your answers. Most doctors and therapists use routine screening tools, such as CAGE, to evaluate your drinking habits and determine the best course of treatment for you.The CAGE screening assessment tool includes 4 basic questions that follow the acronym C-A-G-E. Those questions are: C- Have you ever felt you needed to cut down on your drinking? A- Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking? G- Have you ever felt guilty about drinking? E- Have you ever felt you needed a drink first thing in the morning (eye opener) to steady your nerves or to get rid of a hangover?Physical exams and lab work are important steps in order to provide the best care. For example, you should not take the ant-craving medication naltrexone if your lab work reveals problems with your liver function., Your regular primary care physician is a good place to start. Your doctor can create a treatment plan that can work for you, or make a referral to a psychiatrist, mental health clinic, or treatment center.Working with an outpatient group or clinic, that provides easy access to multidisciplinary professionals trained in treating alcohol addiction, can make it easier for you by having all your care centered in one place., Develop your treatment goals with the guidance of your doctor or psychiatrist, get started with medications that may be helpful to you, work with a therapist to help change your behaviors, and get involved with a support program.Make a commitment to yourself to follow through with your plan for sobriety. For many people, committing to abstinence is a difficult step to take, especially at first. Work with your team of healthcare professionals to set realistic goals., Some people who are heavy users of alcohol may need to be initially treated in a hospital setting in order to be closely monitored for withdrawal symptoms, such as alcohol withdrawal delirium, delirium tremens, or DT's, can be serious, and possibly life-threatening.Consult with your doctor before beginning any treatment plan

, If your doctor determines that your condition is best managed at an inpatient level of care, you will be evaluated, and treatments will be started that help you get through the difficult detox period. The treatments are designed to make you as comfortable as possible and avoid serious harm that can sometimes occur from heavy alcohol consumption.Part of that care will likely be a short course of medication to make you comfortable as your body goes through withdrawal from the alcohol. Benzodiazepines are commonly used, but treatment protocols vary from one facility to another.The length of stay is usually just a few days. During that time, a physical exam and lab work will be done that provides information on the level of care you need. Plus, the physical and lab work evaluations can be helpful to your outpatient doctor after your discharge. You will likely meet with professionals of other disciplines during your stay that can help, such as nurses and therapistsThe inpatient team can help arrange your initial appointments, put you in contact with support groups, and get you started with your treatment goals., In addition to medications provided during your stay, you may be given prescriptions to get filled once you are discharged. The discharge prescriptions provided can help you avoid lingering problems with physical withdrawal, and feelings of anxiety. A prescription for an anti-craving medication that is suited to your needs may also be provided.

, Your treatment team, including at least your doctor and therapist, and are there to guide you through your treatment. They may ask you to participate in activities a little outside of your comfort zone, like possibly attending mutual support groups such as AA. Follow through with your treatment plan. Talk to your doctor and therapist if certain aspects are not for you. There are many ways to help you reach your goal., Remove all alcohol from your house. Seek the support of friends and family, especially people that live in your home. During the early stages of your treatment, avoid social situations that may trigger your desire to drink., Stay away from former drinking buddies, unless they want to join you in your effort to abstain. Enroll in evening classes, join a volunteer group, start a new hobby, exercise, or enjoy outdoor activities that do not include alcohol., Disulfiram is most commonly known by the original brand name, Antabuse®. Some people may confuse the way disulfiram works to help people quit drinking, with the way the newer medications work. The mechanisms of the available agents are different in each case.Disulfiram has been used effectively for more than 60 years to help people stop drinking. Disulfiram works by inhibiting one of the enzymes involved in the breakdown and elimination of alcohol by-products from the body. Build up of these by-products occurs if you were to drink after taking disulfiram, resulting in very unpleasant feeling that has been likened to a bad hangover. You may experience symptoms like nausea and vomiting, flushing, sweating, and heart palpitations.Taking disulfiram often involves the help of a close friend or family member to monitor the daily dosing of the medication as the medication will be cleared from the body and therefore not effective within about two to three days from the last dose. Compliance with treatment is important to ensure that the drug remains in their system at all times. Having someone to monitor compliance prevents the person from stopping the doses on their own, then going back to drinking alcohol. Using disulfiram requires a commitment to abstinence.Be aware of safety issues with disulfiram. Serious problems associated with disulfiram involve the dangerous reaction that can occur if you consume alcohol while taking this drug. Topical products that contain alcohol can also trigger that unwanted reaction. The alcohol warning is extended to other drugs that contain alcohol such as some cough syrups and tonics. Disulfiram should not be used in people that are taking metronidazole, or paraldehyde.Disulfiram is not to be used in people with severe heart disease, psychotic disorders, certain allergies to ingredients found in pesticides, and in people that are exposed to alcohol based chemicals in their work., Naltrexone comes in an oral dosing form, which is given once a day, and an extended-release injectable form, given once a month. There is no physical reaction or sickness if you drink alcohol while receiving naltrexone.The people that do the best with naltrexone are those that are trying to achieve abstinence. Not everyone is ready, especially at first, to make that commitment. That’s ok.Naltrexone works by blocking receptors in your brain that are involved in the rewarding, and positive, feelings that happen when you drink. Because it works in the reward center of the brain, naltrexone can also help to reduce cravings.Research with the oral dosing form of naltrexone has shown an overall reduction in the risk of relapse during the first 3 months of therapy by about 36%. Plus, about 25% of people taking the injectable form of naltrexone experienced fewer heavy drinking days.Use naltrexone safely. Naltrexone relies on your liver to metabolize the drug into other forms, and to keep your blood level of the drug in a safe range. If you have any liver problems, or signs of liver problems (such as swelling in your legs, bloated abdomen, or intense nausea) while you are taking naltrexone, contact your doctor immediately.Avoid opiates while taking naltrexone, as naltrexone works by blocking the same receptors that opiates bind to. A serious complication can occur if naltrexone is used when there are opiates, or opiate derivatives in your system. The reaction can be severe if any opiates linger in your system as you begin naltrexone therapy.Expect your doctor to perform blood work in order to proceed safely. Taking naltrexone while opiates are in your system can induce a sudden, and sometimes severe, situation of opiate withdrawal. Medical attention is warranted if this should occur. Completely avoid opiates during your therapy with naltrexone., Acamprosate, currently marketed under the brand name of Campral®, works in a different way. Again, there is no physical reaction that happens if you drink while taking acamprosate.Acamprosate is dosed orally, and given 3 times every day. The drug works in your brain by acting on the receptors that cause the uncomfortable symptoms when you are trying to stop drinking.Some of the symptoms acamprosate can help to minimize include insomnia, anxiety and jitteriness, restlessness, and feeling generally unhappy with life.Studies show that acamprosate may be especially helpful in people that have been drinking for a long time. Plus, the people that did the best with this drug were those that wanted to reach a goal of abstinence. As many as 36% of people taking acamprosate were able to maintain their abstinence for at least 6 months.Know more about taking acamprosate safely. Avoid using this drug if you have severe kidney problems. Acamprosate depends on your kidney function to remove the drug from your system with routine use. You should not take acamprosate if you have serious kidney disease.Do not take acamprosate if you have certain allergies. People that are allergic to sodium sulfite or sulfite containing products should not take acamprosate. Sulfite sensitivity is more common in people with asthma. Sulfites are found in a variety of foods.Some examples include prepared food products such as dried fruit, canned fruits or vegetables, some shellfish, and foods made with potatoes, like instant mashed potatoes. Let your doctor know if you have food allergies that may include sulfites.Watch for feelings of depression or suicidal thoughts. Let your doctor know immediately if you develop feelings of depression or suicide once you start taking acamprosate. These feelings have been reported with this drug, and warrant medical attention if they should develop., Topiramate has shown very promising results in clinical studies; however the drug is not yet approved for use in the treatment of alcohol disorders by the FDA. That means that your doctor can prescribe topiramate for you as an off-label use.Topiramate is given in oral doses, with the dosing gradually titrated upward to reach the desired results. This drug works by manipulating chemicals involved with the reward center in the brain. This helps to reduce alcohol use, and to reduce associated cravings.The clinical research studies included people that were still drinking alcohol at the time they were started on the drug. Participants were continuing to show improvement as the 14 week studies came to an end.Overall, topiramate increased the number of days some people were able to remain alcohol-free, and decreased the number of heavy drinking days for others. While comparative results are not available, the study results suggest that topiramate may be more effective than either naltrexone or acamprosate.Take topiramate safely. One of the more serious complications caused by the use of topiramate involves your eyes. If left unattended, changes in your vision can lead to potentially permanent damage. Any visual changes should be immediately reported to your doctor.Be aware of cognitive changes that can occur. Some people report problems with confusion and alertness when taking topiramate. In many cases, these symptoms can be addressed by adjusting the dose.Pay attention to feeling depressed or having thoughts of suicide. These feelings can possibly develop when taking topiramate. Contact your doctor immediately if you develop these thoughts or feelings.It is very important that you do not stop taking topiramate altogether. The amount of topiramate in your blood needs to be gradually lowered in order to avoid serious side effects such as seizures. Consult with your doctor before stopping this medication; she can help you taper the dose gradually to prevent unwanted effects., The information on the medications can be quite extensive. Know that all drugs have side effects, warnings, contraindications, drug interactions, and possible complications. The published literature about these medications can be overwhelming. Focus on the key points with each drug, and make a list of questions for your doctor.

, Talk to your doctor about including medications as a part of your treatment plan. Be sure you understand how to safely use the medication your doctor recommends for you. As you consider the possible treatment options, do not overlook the safety risks involved with doing nothing.

, Drug interactions can be critical if you are taking an existing medication that can cause problems when the new medication, to help you quit drinking, is added to your regimen.


Be sure to talk to your doctor about all medical conditions you may have, and every medication you are currently taking, including over-the-counter products.

, Taking a medication designed to help you manage your alcohol addiction may be critical to your success. Expand your knowledge about how the drugs work, how to take them safely, and how to stop them if they are not right for you.


Online and written materials are easily accessed, plus your doctor can provide additional information as you consider the use of medications. The detailed information describing possible side effects and drug interactions goes beyond the scope of the information presented here. A good understanding of the available agents can help you create a list of questions for your doctor. Selecting the drug best suited to your needs can help you conquer your alcohol addiction problem.

Take a wait and see approach.,
Properly diagnose bacterial infections.,
Avoid getting influenced by patient demands.,
Deflect the pressures of drug companies.,
Display posters that commit to reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions.",How to Reduce Unnecessary Antibiotic Use2," Most people who get antibiotics from doctors present with upper respiratory infections that cause symptoms such as coughing, runny nose, sore throat and mild fever. The problem is, most upper respiratory symptoms are caused by viruses (such as influenza or the common cold) which do not respond to antibiotics.Most upper respiratory infections (both bacterial and viral) run their course within a few weeks without serious symptoms, so taking a wait and see approach is a good strategy for doctors too.
Sending patients home without medicine is not always popular with patients, but it's helpful for cutting down on unnecessary antibiotic use.
If symptoms persist for longer than two weeks and/or get significantly worse, then taking blood/saliva samples is recommended for diagnosis purposes.

, Antibiotics are only effective against strains of bacteria and don't kill or significantly impact other pathogenic microorganisms such as viruses, fungi or parasites; however, infections caused by these other ""germs"" can cause symptoms nearly identical to bacterial infections. As such, it's crucial that doctors determine the real cause of the infection and not just guess based on symptomatology.To properly diagnose an infection, body fluids must be taken and examined by a medical lab (observed under a microscope, usually) to see what pathogens are infecting the patient.
For upper respiratory infections, a swab should be taken of the back of the patient's throat (which collects mucus) and sent to the lab.
The mucus is then ""cultured"" in a petri dish to see if disease-causing bacteria grow, which confirms a diagnosis of a bacterial infection.

, Patients often go to their doctors with the expectation of getting medications that can combat their infections, or at least make the symptoms better and less severe.With the advent of direct-to-consumer advertising, drug marketing increases patient demand; however, patients usually don't know which drugs are most appropriate for which conditions/symptoms/infections, so doctors should not be influenced by patient demands of antibiotics.


Explain to patients what antibiotics are for and what they don't treat. If the patient doesn't have a bacterial infection (substantiated by a medical lab) then they shouldn't be given antibiotics under any circumstances.
Other over-the-counter and prescription medications (such as anti-inflammatories and painkillers) are often appropriate and effective for non-bacterial infections and should be recommended instead of antibiotics. This allows patients to control their symptoms while their body fights the infections naturally.
Approximately 47 million unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions are issued in outpatient facilities in the U.S. every year., Another source of pressure that doctors must face is from the drug companies, specifically from the ""drug reps"" or pharmaceutical representatives who are the doctor's liaisons.Drug reps monitor their doctor's prescription habits and typically offer bonuses (trips or cruises, for example) for certain levels that are met.


Ignore the pressures and incentives from drug reps and prescribe in a responsible and ethical fashion.
Reduce the temptation to become more social with your drug reps — keep it on a strictly professional (in office) level.
Associate with drugs reps from more than one pharmaceutical company and use a variety of medicines based on safety, availability and affordability.

, Research has found that doctors who display posters in their offices stating their commitment to avoiding inappropriate prescription of antibiotics are much less likely to do so.The posters are cost effective and remind the doctors and patients of the serious issue concerning unnecessary antibiotic use.


Poster usage leads to an average of almost 20% less inappropriate antibiotic use in medical offices that participate.
However, even with a 20% reduction in unnecessary prescriptions, nearly 33% of patients still receive antibiotics without a substantiating diagnosis, so poster usage is only a partial solution.

Rest your injured wrist.,
Change your work station.,
Wear a wrist splint.,
Apply ice to the most tender area.,
Take over-the-counter (OTC) medication.,
Do some stretching and strengthening.,
Make an appointment with your physician.,
Take stronger prescription medications.,
Ask about steroidal injections.,
Get a referral for physiotherapy.,
Consider surgery if need be.",How to Relieve Wrist Pain," If you notice pain in one or both of your wrists, take a break from the aggravating activity and rest for a few minutes, hours or even days depending on the trigger of the pain. In addition to rest, keep your wrist elevated above the level of your heart as much as you can to help prevent swelling / inflammation from developing.Taking a 15 minute break at work may be all that's needed to reduce the irritation in your wrist if you do repetitive tasks, such as working as a cashier or constantly typing on a computer.
Serious trauma to your wrist, either at work or from playing sports, requires more rest and a doctor's examination (see below).;
, A significant proportion of mild-to-moderate wrist pain is caused by repetitive tasks at work or home. Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is an example of a repetitive stress injury to the wrist that irritates the main nerve running into the hand. To combat repetitive strains / sprains, make adjustments to your work environment, such as: lower your keyboard so your wrists are not extended upward while you type, adjust your chair so that your forearms are parallel to the floor, and use an ergonomic typing pad, mouse and split keyboard.Symptoms of CTS include aching, burning, numbness or tingling sensations in your hand and wrist palm, as well as weakness and reduced dexterity.
People who do lots of computer work, cashier jobs, racket sports, sewing, painting, writing and working with vibrating tools are at higher risk for CTS and other repetitive strain injuries.

, Another helpful strategy for preventing and relieving most types of wrist pain is wearing specially designed wrist splints (also called supports or braces).Wrist splints come in many sizes and are made of different materials, but all are designed to relieve wrist pain. Depending on your job / lifestyle, you may want to start with a less restrictive one (made of neoprene, for example) that allows more movement, instead of a stiffer variety that's more supportive and restrictive.


You may only have to wear the wrist splint(s) during the day while at work or at the gym to protect your wrists.
However, some people also need to wear the splints at night in order to keep their wrists in an extended position, which prevents irritation of nerves and blood vessels. This is common with people dealing with CTS or arthritis.
Wrist splints can be purchased at most pharmacies and all medical supply stores. If you ask, your doctor might provide you one at no cost.

, Wrist pain from sudden trauma, such as falling on an outstretched hand or lifting something too heavy, causes immediate pain, inflammation and potential bruising.An effective way of relieving this kind of wrist pain is to apply cold therapy as soon as possible because it reduces / prevents swelling and helps to numb the pain.


Types of appropriate cold therapy for the wrist include crushed ice, ice cubes, cold gel packs and small bags of frozen veggies (or fruit) from your freezer.
Apply cold therapy to the most tender and inflamed part of your wrist for about 10 to 15 minutes at a time, every hour, for approximately five hours post injury for best results.
Whichever type of cold therapy you use, don't put it directly onto the skin of your wrist. Instead, wrap it in a thin cloth or towel first in order to prevent frostbite.

, Regardless if your wrist pain is acute (from a sudden injury) or chronic (lasting for more than a few months), taking OTC medication can be helpful for pain control and allowing more functionality and range of movement. OTC anti-inflammatories, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, are often more effective for acute wrist pain because they combat both pain and inflammation.On the other hand, painkillers such as acetaminophen are more appropriate for chronic issues like arthritis.


Short term use of OTC anti-inflammatories and painkillers (less than two weeks at a time) is recommended to avoid common side effects, such as stomach irritation, intestinal upset and reduced organ function (liver, kidneys).
Don't combine anti-inflammatories and painkillers at the same time, and always follow the dosing information on the packaging for the safest results.

, As long as your wrist isn't broken or severely inflamed, do some flexibility and strengthening exercises every day in order to prevent and combat wrist pain.Increasing the flexibility and strength in the ligaments and tendons of your wrists enables them to withstand more ""wear and tear"" from your job and working out. And with CTS, stretching will take the pressure off the median nerve that innervates the muscles of the hand.


An effective extension-type stretch for the wrists involves striking a pray position with both of your palms together. Then raise your elbows up until you feel a nice stretch in your wrists. Hold for about 30 seconds and do it three to five times daily for best results.
Wrist strengthening can be done with light free weights (less than 10 pounds) or rubber bands / tubing. Hold your hands out with your palms facing up and grip the weights or handles of the tubing. Then flex your wrists towards your body against the tension.
Always stretch and strengthen both wrists together at the same time, even if only one is hurting you. Both sides should have similar strength and flexibility regardless of which hand is more dominant.

, If your wrist pain lasts for more than a week or you are in severe pain, make an appointment with your family doctor for a examination. Your doctor may take x-rays to see if your wrist bones are broken, dislocated, infected or arthritic. Your doctor may also take a blood test to rule out an infection, gout or inflammatory types of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis.


Signs of a broken or dislocated wrist include: severe pain, significantly reduced range of motion, unnatural angles (crooked) and widespread swelling and bruising.Fractures can occur in the small bones of your wrist (carpals) or at the ends of your forearm bones (radius and ulna). Slip and falls and punching solid objects are common causes of wrist fractures.
Bone infections of the wrist are rare, but do happen in illicit drug users and can be triggered by trauma. Severe pain, swelling, skin discoloration, nausea and a fever are signs of a bone infection.

, For more serious injuries and more advanced or serious forms of arthritis, stronger prescription medication may be needed longer term to manage the pain and inflammation in your wrist(s).Examples of prescription non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) include: diclofenac, Fenoprofen, indomethacin. COX-2 inhibitors, such as Celebrex, are a slightly different types of NSAID that are a little easier on the stomach.


Osteoarthritis of the wrist is the ""wear and tear"" type and typically causes stiffness, achy pain and grinding sounds with movement. Rheumatoid arthritis of the wrist is much more painful, inflamed and disfiguring.
Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are able to combat some forms of inflammatory arthritis by suppressing your immune system.
Biologic response modifiers (biologics) are another type of prescription drug used for rheumatoid arthritis, but they must be injected. They also work by altering the function of your immune system.

, Another type of anti-inflammatory medication is corticosteroids, which can be taken by pill, but they are usually injected into the wrist if the pain doesn't go away after a few months.Corticosteroids combat swelling and pain quickly and effectively, but they can cause weakening in the tendons and bones of the wrist. As such, treatments are limited to three to four injections per year typically.


Severe tendonitis, bursitis, CTS, stress fractures and flare-ups of inflammatory arthritis are all reasons to consider a corticosteroid injection.
The procedure is quick and can be done by your doctor. Results are often felt within minutes and can be dramatic, at least for a few weeks or months.

, If you wrist pain is chronic and also involves weakness, your doctor may refer you to a physical therapist in order to teach you tailored and specific stretches and exercises.They may also mobilize your joints to prevent them from getting too stiff, which is beneficial for osteoarthritis. Physical therapy is also very helpful for rehabilitating your wrist after any surgical procedure.


Your physical therapist may also use electronic machines to help with strengthening and pain relief, such as muscle stimulation, therapeutic ultrasound and TENS devices.
Physiotherapy treatments are usually 3x per week and last for 4-6 weeks for most chronic problems of the wrist.

, In some serious cases of wrist pain, surgery may be necessary, particularly to repair severely broken bones, dislocated joints, torn tendons and tight ligaments.For significant bone fractures, your surgeon may need to use metal hardware in your wrist, such as plates, pins and screws.


Most surgeries of the wrist are performed arthroscopically, which is a long, small cutting tool with a camera on the end.
Smaller stress or hairline fractures of the wrist typically don't need surgery -- they are either casted or braced for a few weeks.
Carpal tunnel surgery is relatively common and involves cutting into the wrist and/or hand to relieve pressure on the median nerve. Recovery time can be up to 6 weeks.

Take an NSAID to relieve pain.The first-line pain treatment for ovarian cyst(s) are NSAID pain medications.,
Consider a narcotic pain-killer for severe pain.In some severe cases, a narcotic pain-killer is necessary.,
Confirm that an ovarian cyst is the source of your pain, if you are not sure.,
Talk to your doctor about surgery if your ovarian cyst pain is persistent.For acute (short-term) ovarian cyst pain, a pain medication may be sufficient to relieve the pain until symptoms resolve.,
Have your ovarian cyst removed if there is any suspicion that it may be cancerous.Another key factor in deciding whether or not surgery is needed as a treatment for ovarian cyst(s) is assessing the cyst(s) for the possibility that they may one day become cancerous.,
Try ""watchful waiting"" if the cyst(s) is not immediately worrisome.If your ovarian cyst(s) is not yet showing signs of persistent pain and/or a risk for cancer, your doctor will likely advise that you try the approach of ""watchful waiting."",
Take birth control pills to prevent the formation of new cysts.Although birth control pills cannot help to control the pain of any cyst(s) that are currently present on your ovaries, the pills can serve to prevent any new cysts from forming.,
Ensure that you do not have any medical conditions that prevent you from taking birth control pills.If you have breast cancer, uterine cancer, or another cancer that is ""fed"" by estrogen, you will be advised not to take hormonal birth control pills.,
Continue taking birth control as a prophylactic measure.,
Consume ginger and/or turmeric for their anti-inflammatory properties.Rather than always opting for medical anti-inflammatories, such as Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), another option for less severe pain is to add natural anti-inflammatory ingredients to your diet.,
Use heat.,
See an acupuncturist or a hypnotist.,
Try distracting yourself from the pain.",How to Relieve Ovarian Cyst Pain," These can be obtained over-the-counter at your local pharmacy or drugstore. They can also be received in stronger formulations by asking your doctor for a prescription, if the over-the-counter (OTC) versions are insufficient to relieve your pain.


An example of an NSAID medication is ibuprofen (Advil, or Motrin). The typical dose is 400 – 600mg every four to six hours as needed. Follow the dosing instructions on the bottle.
Another NSAID option is naproxen (Aleve). This is available over-the-counter, or as a stronger version that is available via a prescription from your physician.;
, The first-line narcotic used in the treatment of ovarian cyst pain is morphine, an opiate.


Narcotics are the last option when it comes to pain relief. In light of the national epidemic of narcotic abuse/misuse in the United States, opiate medication should be only taken in an emergency room setting or for the shortest possible amount of time.
Additionally, if you have a substance abuse history and previous addiction to illicit or prescription medication, the decision to utilize this should be weighed against the risks of harm and/or relapse.
Morphine for ovarian cyst pain is most often given via an IV, and in a hospital setting.
This is because, to warrant this strength of medication, the pain is usually very severe, resulting in a visit to the Emergency Room.
Initially, a small dose of Morphine is administered via IV; the dose is increased incrementally until the pain gets under control.
Morphine is also a very safe option within the hospital setting. It can readily be reversed with Naloxone should any adverse reactions occur.

, If you are experiencing abdominal or pelvic pain, it is important to see your doctor and to receive a physical examination, an ultrasound, and any other necessary tests to confirm that the source of your pain is indeed an ovarian cyst(s).Many other conditions may cause pain similar to ovarian cyst(s), so it is important to see your doctor to confirm that is indeed an ovarian cyst(s) that is the source of your pain.


Your doctor may perform a pelvic ultrasound in which a wand-like device is inserted into your vagina and uses high-frequency sound waves to create a picture of your ovaries on a video screen. This imaging test can help your doctor confirm the presence of a cyst, identify its location and determine whether it's solid, filled with fluid or mixed., If the pain persists for two to three menstrual cycles, if it is large, doesn't look like a functional cyst, or is growing, you will likely be advised to proceed with surgery to have your ovarian cyst(s) removed.


The vast majority of ovarian cysts are benign.Either just the cyst can be removed from the ovary, or the entire ovary can be removed. The extent of the surgery will depend upon the number of cysts present on the ovary, as well as the age of the patient and reproductive considerations. (The surgery is generally more extensive following menopause.)
Fortunately, if the entire ovary needs to be removed surgically, there is still the ovary on the other side, so the woman does not need to lose her fertility by having a surgical procedure performed.

, If there is the risk of them developing into a cancer, your doctor will advise that surgery be performed to prevent this from occurring.


When an ovarian cyst(s) is removed due to the possibility of it becoming cancerous, it is advised to have the fallopian tubes and uterus removed in addition to both ovaries.
This, of course, has reproductive implications that need to be discussed with your doctor, because having all of these structures removed will make you infertile.

, This consists of using pain medications as needed to relieve your ovarian cyst pain, while hoping that the cyst ultimately resolves itself without the need for medical intervention. You must, however, commit to thorough follow-up with serial ultrasounds.This will ensure the cysts don't get worse.


If the cysts do not improve with time, surgery may be advised.

, As such, doctors advise patients with ovarian cyst(s) to begin hormonal birth control pills as a method to prevent the problem from getting any worse than it currently is.


You can receive a prescription for birth control pills from your family doctor.
The pills are taken once a day for three weeks, followed by one week off (or one week of ""sugar pills""). This cycle repeats monthly.
The hormones in the birth control pills replace the hormones that are normally produced by your ovaries.
The ovaries then temporarily ""shut down"" hormone production while you are on the pill, and this greatly reduces the risk of any new cysts forming.

, If you are a current smoker and older than 35 years old, you will also be advised against taking the pills due to a heightened risk of developing blood clots. Similarly, if you have another bleeding disorders (such as a hereditary bleeding disorder), you should not take the pill due to the risk of blood clots.


Your doctor will go over your medical history with you to determine the safety of taking hormonal birth control pills.
For the majority of people, it is completely safe to take the pills.

, Taking birth control pills will reduce the chance of developing new cysts in the future. In addition, it can reduce your chances of developing ovarian cancer. In fact, the longer you take birth control pills, the more your risk is reduced.

, Examples include ginger and turmeric. Both ginger and turmeric can be added as spices to foods, and you can make them part of your home recipes to decrease the painful inflammation that can be associated with ovarian cysts.

, Applying heat over your abdominal/pelvic area (over the source of the pain) can help to relax your muscles and to ease the pain. Try using a hot water bottle or a heating pad for 15 minutes at a time, as needed, to relieve ovarian cyst pain.


You may also opt for a hot bath as a means to apply heat to the area.
An Epsom salt bath is even better, as the magnesium in the salts helps with muscle relaxation, which can reduce the pain even further., Although acupuncture and hypnosis are not generally recommended by traditional western medical doctors, some people find them helpful with pain management (such as helping with the pain of ovarian cysts). Acupuncturists work with needles to correct the flow of energy through the body, with the ultimate goal of relieving (or diminishing) pain. Hypnotists work to decrease your mind's perception of pain., Find an activity you can do that will distract you from the pain from your cyst. Reading a good book, using guided imagery, playing a video game, doing something crafty, or doing anything that will take your mind off the pain can help.

Try deep breathing or meditation to cope with your pain.

Recognize the symptoms of a fractured clavicle.,
Go to the doctor so the bone can be set properly.,
Have surgery if the broken ends of the bone don’t connect.,
Reduce pain and swelling with ice.,
Rest.,
Get relief from over-the-counter painkillers.,
Eat a diet that is rich in calcium.,
Get enough vitamin D. Vitamin D is necessary for people to absorb calcium.,
Help your body heal with physical therapy.,
Ease stiffness with warmth.,
Ask your doctor if you are strong enough for other pain reduction methods.",How to Relieve Pain from Clavicle Fracture," It hurts and has a distinctive set of symptoms. People with clavicle fractures often have:Pain that gets worse when the shoulder moves
Swelling
Pain when the clavicle is touched
Bruising
A bump on or near the shoulder
A crunching noise or grinding sensation when you move your shoulder
Difficulty moving the shoulder
Tingling or numbness in your arm or fingers
A sagging shoulder;
, This is important so that it can heal as quickly as possible and in the proper position. Bones that don't heal in the proper position often heal with strange-looking lumps.The doctor will do an X-ray and maybe even a CT scan to figure out exactly where the fracture is.
The doctor will put your arm in a sling. This is because when you move your shoulder, your clavicle also moves. It may also reduce the pain by taking some of the weight off the fractured clavicle.
Children will have to wear the sling for one to two months. Adults will have to wear it for two to four months.
The doctor might have you wear a figure-eight bandage to keep your arm and collarbone in the correct position.

, If this is the case, it may be necessary to have surgery to hold the pieces in the correct position while they heal. While surgery is unpleasant, it will make sure that it heals without any remaining marks or lumps.The doctor may use plates, screws, or rods to stabilize the bone.

, The cold will slow down the rate of swelling. It will also help numb it a little bit.Use an ice pack or a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a towel. Don’t put the ice directly on your skin because this can damage your skin.
On the first day, ice the fracture for 20 minutes per hour each hour during the day.
For the next few days afterwards, use the ice every three to four hours.

, If you stay quiet your body will be able to direct more energy into healing. Resting will also reduce your chances of injuring yourself more.If it hurts to move your arm, don’t. That is your body telling you that it is too soon.
You may need more sleep while healing. Be sure to get at least eight hours.
Being rested will also put you in a better mood and help you cope with the pain.

, These medications will also reduce inflammation. But wait 24 hours after the injury occurred before using these medications because they can increase bleeding or may decrease bone healing.Waiting 24 hours allows your body to begin healing naturally.


Try ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin)
Take naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn)
Follow the manufacturer’s instructions and your doctor’s orders. Do not take more.
Do not give medications containing aspirin to children under 19.
Consult your doctor if you have or have previously had heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney problems, stomach ulcers or internal bleeding.
Do not mix these medications with alcohol or other medications including over-the-counter medications, herbal remedies, or supplements.
Talk to your doctor if your pain is still unbearable. Your doctor can write you a prescription for something stronger.

, Calcium is vital for your body to build bone. The following foods are good sources of calcium:Cheese, milk, yogurt, and other dairy.
Broccoli, kale, and other dark, green, leafy vegetables.
Fish with bones soft enough to eat, such as sardines or canned salmon
Foods where calcium has been added. Examples include soy, cereal, fruit juice, and milk substitutes.

, You can get vitamin D from:Spending time in the sun. Your body will produce vitamin D when sunlight hits your skin.
Eating eggs, meat, salmon, mackerel, and sardines.
Eating foods that have had vitamin D added, such as cereal, soy products, dairy, and powdered milk.

, This will help reduce stiffness while you are wearing the sling. After the sling is off, it will help you strengthen the muscles and regain flexibility.The physical therapist will give you exercises that are designed for your level of strength and healing. Be sure to do them as directed.
Build up slowly. If it hurts, stop. Don’t do too much too soon.

, Once the injury is no longer swelling, you can apply heat. This will feel good and increase circulation. Either warm or dry heat should help.


If you feel sore after physical therapy, this may help.
Apply a warm pack for about 15 minutes. But don’t put it directly onto your skin. Wrap it in a towel so you won’t burn yourself.

, But don’t do these activities before your doctor says you are ready. Possibilities include:


Acupuncture
Massage
Yoga

"
Construct a chart of how your preventive medications should be taken.,
Laminate the chart or put it in a clear sheet protector, and keep it in or near your medicine box.

,
Purchase a divided weekly medication box at the pharmacy that is appropriate to the size of pills taken and the number of times per day.,
Choose a day of the week to fill your weekly container.,
Keep a sticky note in your master container and note the date on which you filled your container.,
If you find that you regularly forget to take your pills, you will need to set alarms.,
If you need to take daily medication while not at home, purchase a smaller pillbox, pill fob, or small plastic daily pill bag (sold at pharmacies, can be written on with a Sharpie).",How to Organize Migraine Medication2," Include the following columns: Brand name, generic name, dosage, and a separate column for each time of day that medication is taken. When filling in the columns, put in a number for how many pills should be taken at that time. For example, if you take a certain medication once at breakfast and two pills at bedtime, put a “1” in the breakfast column and a “2” in the bedtime column.

,, It will be labeled with the days of the week. If you take pills only once per day, there will be sections for seven days of pills. Other boxes have sections for seven days, four pill times per day. Choose a box with secure flip tops or secure sliding tops. A childproof lock can be helpful as well.

, Use your chart to fill it accurately. Now you can put away your master container somewhere secure (such as in the top of your closet) where it will not be in the way. Keep your weekly container wherever you are most likely to remember to take your medicine. Although medication should not be stored in humid or hot areas, it is still possible to keep your box in a kitchen cupboard or even in your bathroom cupboard, especially if you stick it in a ziplock bag.

, When you have three dates listed, call your pharmacy for refills, helping you avoid last minute refill emergencies.

, Two methods work best. Either buy a watch with alarms (preferably multiple ones) and set them to go off at daily regular times, or use alarms on your cell phone. Choose a unique ringtone that will mean “take meds” to you.

, Make a label for the pill container or write on it with a permanent marker (“lunch”) and put it in your pocket, briefcase, purse, or wherever it will be available during the day. You will find many different designs for pill boxes. They should either have tops that screw on, or latch in some way. You do not want to open your purse and find loose medication all over the bottom! Many pill fobs can be attached to a key chain, and there are even attractive fobs that can be worn as a necklace if you do some careful web shopping.

"
"
See #7 above about portable pill containers.,
Clearly label each container with the medication name (or an abbreviation).,
If there are other places where you know you might need emergency meds, make a duplicate set of containers to keep there.,
Make a small card that fits in your wallet listing each medication name, the dosage, and guidelines given to you from your doctor about how frequently the medication can be taken.,
Remember to check and refill these containers regularly.,
Note your use of emergency meds on your headache diary, so that you can show your doctor at your next appointment.

,
Check the bottles of emergency medications and refill as needed when you refill your preventive medications.

",How to Organize Migraine Medication3," Purchase as many pill containers as you have types of emergency medications. Make sure each container will hold the maximum number of emergency pills that you would be allowed to use over the course of two days. This will ensure that you do not end up short of pills.

, Keep them with you in your purse or briefcase. I prefer fobs with rings on the top that can be fastened together on a spare key chain – then I can grab them easily from my purse.

, This might include your desk at work, your gym bag, your car, or the nurse’s office if you are a student.

, This will help prevent accidents with overly frequent dosing.

, You can do this when you do your preventive meds, or more frequently if necessary.

Use an ice pack.,
Try a heating pad.,
Apply a topical pain relief medicine.,
Take an Epsom salt bath.,
Add essential oils to a bath.,
Get an essential oil massage.",How to Relieve Muscle Pain1," You can use an ice pack to reduce pain, swelling, and inflammation. Ice is often recommended for acute injuries or as a treatment for pain when it first starts. To use an ice to relieve muscle pain, wrap an ice pack in a paper towel and place it on the affected area.Leave the ice pack in place for about 10 minutes, then remove it and give your skin a break for a about an hour. Using an ice pack for too long can cause tissue damage.
Make sure you always wrap an ice pack in a towel or cloth, as applying it directly to your skin can lead to frostbite.;
, You might find heat useful for chronic (long-term) pain, stress, and for muscle pain after the first 12–24 hours after your muscle pain begins.


Keep in mind that heat can make inflammation feel worse.If heat makes the pain feel worse, then stick with ice packs.
If you don’t have a heating pad, then you can just fill a water bottle with warm water and wrap it in a towel. Then, apply the bottle to the affected area.
Make sure that you remove the heating pad after about 10-15 minutes and give your skin a break. Using a heating pad for too long may cause burns.

, There are many topical pain relief products available as well. These products are often in the form of a cream or salve that you can rub into your skin over the affected muscles. Just make sure that you do not use any of these products on broken skin. These products often include ingredients such as:


Capsaicin, which is derived from the chili pepper and it helps to reduce pain in muscles and joints.Arnica Montana, a plant that has been used for centuries to relieve muscle pain.
Menthol, camphor, and other herbs. Camphor and menthol act as anti-inflammatory agents, which may help with muscle pain., Hot soaks in water filled with minerals may also help to relieve muscle pain. The heat relaxes your muscles and your body can absorb the minerals, such as magnesium, through your skin. These minerals are thought to provide pain relief.To take an Epsom salt bath, add 1–2 cups of Epsom salts to a tub of warm-hot bath water. Soak in the water for about 20 minutes. Don't stay in the bath too long or you risk dehydrating yourself.

, You can also add essential oils to an Epsom salt bath or just use them in a regular bath. Try adding eight to 10 drops of oil directly to the bath water. Some essential oils that may help relieve muscle pain include:


Lavender
Bergamot
Peppermint
Marjoram
Ginger
Pine
Eucalyptus

, Massage is also an effective way to get fast relief from muscle pain.It is necessary to add essential oils to a base oil, diluting it slightly to avoid irritation or other side effects. Choose an anti-inflammatory oil such as coconut oil or almond oil as a base. Add a total of 12–15 drops of essential oils to two ounces of the base oil. Make sure that the mixture is at room temperature before using it.


If you can reach the affected muscles, then you can massage the oil into your aching muscles yourself. If not, then ask a friend to help you.
If you can afford it, then you may want to consider a professional massage. They can be expensive, but a professional massage therapist will be able to target the areas that are giving you the most trouble.

Rest as much as possible.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Stretch your muscles.,
Breathe deeply.",How to Relieve Muscle Pain2," It is essential to rest if you are experiencing muscle pain. If you continue to work and exercise through your pain, then you may end up making it worse. Take a day off to give your body to rest and recover.


If you do not want to take a day off from your normal exercise routine, then try working a different part of your body. For example, if your arms and back feel sore, then do exercises that focus only on your legs., Muscles are made of up of 75% water, so staying hydrated is a good way to help support healing.Most people need to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water every day, but you may need more or less depending on your size, age, and activity level.

, Doing some gentle stretching might also help to relieve muscle pain. For example, if your back muscles hurt, then doing a forward bend may help stretch the muscles and bring you some relief. Try incorporating some gentle stretching into your daily routine.


If you have chronic muscle pain, then you may want to check with a physical therapist to find out what sorts of stretches will help.
It is a good idea to warm up your muscles before stretching them. You can warm up your muscles by doing about five minutes of aerobic activity such as walking or riding a bike., Deep, slow breathing exercises may also help to relieve muscle pain.Try taking some slow, deep breaths to help your muscles relax.


To take a slow, deep breath, first get into a comfortable position. Try sitting in a comfortable chair or lying down on your bed. Then, count up to five as you breathe in through your nose, then count down from five as you breathe out through your mouth. Repeat this process several times.
You might also find it helpful to listen to some relaxing music or nature sounds as you breathe. The sounds might help you to relax even more.

See your doctor if muscle pain does not improve within three to four days.,
Take an over-the-counter pain reliever.,
Ask your doctor about anti-inflammatory supplements.",How to Relieve Muscle Pain3," If nothing helps or if you still have pain after three to four days, call your physician. Your physician may need to take a history, run general and specific lab tests, and perform a physical examination to determine the cause. You should also call your physician if you have:Severe, persistent or unexplained pain
Signs of infection such as swelling, warmth, and/or redness around the affected area
Poor circulation around the injured muscle
A tick bite or a rash that occurs after an insect bite
Started on a new medication or changed the dose of a medication

, Over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen may help to relieve muscle pain as well. Make sure that you read the packaging and follow the instructions. Check with your doctor first if you are taking any medications or if you are being treated for any medical condition., Some supplements may help to treat and prevent muscle pain relief due to their anti-inflammatory properties. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions when taking any supplements and always check with your physician before trying any supplements. Supplements can interact with over-the-counter and prescription medications. Some supplements to consider include:


Bromelain. Bromelain has anti-inflammatory properties that may be comparable to taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as ibuprofen.
White willow bark. Aspirin is made from white willow bark so this supplement may have similar effects.Wobenzym. Wobenzym is a combination of anti-inflammatory enzymes that may help treat muscle pain."

Notice if the drug is taken alone.",How to Prevent Benzodiazepine Overdose," The easiest way to avoid overdose is to follow the medication dosage provided by your doctor. Generally, you will start on a smaller dose, but your doctor may gradually move you up over time if you begin to develop a tolerance to the medication. Either way, sticking to the prescribed dosage should help you avoid an overdose.If you're unclear about how often you should take your medication, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.;
, Don't try to change your dose on your own, even if you think the drug is not working. Always change dosages as advised by your doctor. If you up your dose on your own, you could risk overdosing. In addition, trying to wean off the drugs on your own could lead to major withdrawal symptoms. Any change in dosage should be under the advice of a doctor and closely monitored by your doctor., You should take your medication at the same time every day (if you take it every day), as varying when you take it could lead to accidental overdose. That is, if you take the drug at 10 pm one day and noon the next day (on a once-a-day schedule), there's not a full 24 hours between doses, and you'll have more in your system than you should.Also, you should only take benzodiazepines as often as your doctor or pharmacist says you can, especially if you are not taking them regularly. Taking them more often will up the amount of the drug in your system, which could lead to overdosing.

, Taking other people's benzodiazepines can lead to overdosing, as you don't know how the medication will affect you. The medication affects different groups of people differently, and your doctor may start you out on a much lower dose of a medication than what another person is currently taking.


For instance, benzodiazepines, including drugs like alprazolam, can affect seniors more than other adults. Specifically, the half-life is longer for seniors than for other adults, meaning it stays in your system longer. Therefore, it's easier to overdose, as you may take too much based on what's already in your system.Teens taking benzodiazepines may have similar problems. It's important to only take these medications if they are prescribed for you by a doctor.
In addition, elderly patients who are on benzodiazepines are more susceptible to falls and vehicle crashes.Another concern is obesity. The half-life of benzodiazepines can be longer in obese patients than in other patients.

, Benzodiazepines may be prescribed by someone other than your primary doctor, such as a psychiatrist. For that reason, it's imperative that you tell them about all your medical conditions and any other medications you may be taking, so that they know what could affect your absorption of these drugs. For instance, if your liver is not functioning as it should, that could cause absorption problems. Similarly, if you have problems with your kidneys, that could also affect how you absorb these drugs.Some medications when combined with benzodiazepines can have an increased sedative effective, especially if absorption rates are affected.
While not a disease, alcohol can also be problematic. If you drink alcohol regularly, that could change how you absorb these drugs, as well as make it easier to overdose. Avoid taking alcohol with benzodiazepines, or at the very least, be honest about your usage with your doctor.

, If you miss a dose, you may automatically try to take the next dose. If it is not very long after you missed your dose, that's fine. However, if you're closer to the time when you would take your next dose, you should just wait and take your next dose, skipping the missed dose. Taking two doses too close together can lead to an overdose., These drugs are generally taken orally, though some are given intravenously in the hospital. Either way is safe, as long as it is under the direction of a doctor.However, some people who abuse the drug crush it and ingest it through the nose.One of the main problems with this method is you can easily take more than you intend to, which could lead to an overdose.


Similarly, you shouldn't inject the drug yourself unless instructed by a doctor, as this can make it easier to overdose., Even without overdosing, you can have other serious side effects. For instance, some people experience anterograde amnesia, which is when your brain has trouble creating new memories. In addition, many patients become dependent on these drugs as well as developing a tolerance, meaning they will want to continually take higher doses as time goes on. Talk to your doctor if you experience these symptoms.You may notice other side effects, including drowsiness, confusion, depression, vision problems, slurred speech, dizziness, and tremors. You may also notice stomach problems and dry mouth. In higher doses, you may notice mood swings and slower reflexes., This class of medications are used as tranquilizers that work on the central nervous system.They are used for things like anti-anxiety (such as diazepam, lorazepam, alprazolam, clorazepate, and chlordiazepoxide), muscle relaxation (such as diazepam), and sedation (such as estazolam, flurazepam, and temazepam).They can also be used to treat things like convulsions (using diazepam or clonazepam, for instance) or alcohol withdrawal (using chlordiazepoxide). In some cases, they can be prescribed to help with anesthesia, such as the drug midazolam.
However, because of their depressant effects, they are often used recreationally, which can lead to overdosing.

, People who use other drugs recreationally, such as methadone or cocaine, will often take a benzodiazepine to mitigate the side effects. However, if you do take this drug with other drugs, you're less likely to use caution when taking benzodiazepine, which in turn could lead to an overdose. It's best not to use any drug recreationally because of the potential problems., While taking benzodiazepines with other depressants may not seem like that big of a deal, it can make it easier for you to overdose. Many other depressants, such as opioid painkillers, barbiturates, and alcohol, are legal to take. However, they work in similar ways on your system (as sedatives), which could lead to an overdose.Make sure any drugs you take are under the direction of a doctor and that you take them as prescribed.

, Overdosing can happen even if you've only taken the drug once, though it's unlikely if you are taking it under the direction of a doctor. Nonetheless, you should be on the lookout for short-term overdose symptoms, which include rapid breathing, rapid pulse (that's weaker than normal), clammy skin, and dilated pupils.If left untreated, you can go into a coma or even die from a benzodiazepine overdose.

, Long-acting benzodiazepines (as opposed to short-acting benzodiazepines) can build up in your system over time because your body rids itself of the drug slowly. Specifically, it can build up in your body fat. This problem can occur even if you are taking your medication properly, but it is more likely to occur if you are taking more than you should every day for long periods. Regardless, you should watch for symptoms of sedation.You may find you're disoriented, confused, or feel groggy. You may feel klutzy or weak, and you might find you have slurred speech.

, Seek emergency medical care if you are exhibiting signs of short- or long-term overdose. Go to the emergency room if you are exhibiting signs of short-term overdose, particularly if you used the drug with another drug or substance (such as alcohol), as that can make it more life-threatening., If a person is abusing benzodiazepines, they'll like seem detached or sedated from life. Because these drugs are depressants, they can make the person uninterested in what's going on around them, including avoiding social events and not seeming to care about their future.You should also check for these signs in yourself. If you find that you've stopped caring about your life and you don't even want to visit loved ones (and you're taking these drugs), it could be a sign of addiction.

, Another symptom that can occur with benzodiazepine abuse is the person has intense mood swings, somewhat like bipolar disorder. Also, people who are abusing these drugs may experience panic attacks, as well as anxiety. If you notice a person's moods have changed (including your own), that could be a sign of abuse in conjunction with other symptoms., If someone is abusing these drugs, they are likely getting them from multiple sources, such as obtaining prescriptions from more than one doctor. You may notice more bottles around, a drop in cash flow, or an uptick in the number of doctor's visits.Other people may even fake the prescription, while still others may ask friends and family members for pills.You might also see bags of pills lying around, if the person got them from a dealer.
If you find that you're trying to get these drugs on a regular basis from multiple sources, you may have a problem. Talk to your doctor or an addiction counselor for help.

, People who abuse benzodiazepines often do so by mixing them with other drugs and depressants. For instance, taking the drug with something like alcohol or opioid painkillers will increase the effects of the drugs. However, because these drugs work in a similar fashion, it makes it much easier to overdose if they are mixed.Similarly, it's not a good idea to mix benzodiazepines with recreational drugs, such as cocaine or methadone. When mixing these drugs, you're less likely to pay attention to dosage, making it easier to overdose."

Rest your foot.,
Use a foot support.,
Use an ice pack.",How to Relieve Plantar Fasciitis Pain1," One of the best ways to relieve the pain of plantar fasciitis is to rest it. This means staying off of it as much as you can. When you are home or at work, try to stay seated and only walk on it if you have to. You might consider using crutches for a few days to take all pressure off the foot.If you usually do exercises that use your foot, consider doing something different, like swimming or weight lifting.;
, An arch support can help distribute the pressure of your foot in an even way, which can take the extra stress off your plantar fascia. You can also use a heel cup. You can get an arch support without a prescription at many drug stores, medical supply stores, and pharmacies.


These foot supports go inside your shoes.
Examples of arch supports that come with a soft cushion are Spenco and Cross Trainers. For some people, a custom-made support may be needed. These can be acquired through your doctor.

, Ice is helpful with plantar fasciitis pain because it works to reduce inflammation. You can use an ice pack on the bottom of your foot for 20 minutes three to four times a day. You can also try using an ice bath, which is where you soak your foot in an ice and water mixture for about ten to fifteen minutes.Make sure to place a cloth or towel between the ice pack and your skin.
Heat generally doesn’t help plantar fasciitis pain, but if the ice doesn’t help, you can try a heating pad after a couple days to see if it will relieve pain.

You can do this once or twice a day after approval from your doctor. Cold packs may reduce swelling and inflammation.Never apply ice or an ice pack directly to your skin. Make sure to wrap the ice pack in a thin cloth or towel before placing it on your skin. This will prevent damage to your skin tissue.;
, If you're experiencing moderate hernia pain, you may get some relief from over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Always follow the manufacturer's dosing instructions.If you find yourself relying on OTC pain medications for more than a week, talk with your doctor. Your doctor might be able to prescribe a stronger pain medication.

, If you have a hiatal hernia (of the stomach), you probably have hyperacidity known as reflux. You can take over-the-counter (OTC) antacids and medications to reduce acid production, as well as prescription medications like proton pump inhibitors (PPI) that reduce acid production.If your reflux symptoms don't improve after several days, you should see your doctor. If left untreated, reflux can severely damage your esophagus. Instead, your doctor can prescribe medications that treat the reflux and heal your digestive organs.

, If you have an inguinal hernia (of the groin), you may want to wear a special support which can also reduce your pain. Talk with your doctor about wearing a truss which is like supportive underwear. Or, you might wear a support belt or harness that helps keep the hernia in place. To wear a support, lay down and wrap the belt or harness around the hernia to keep it snug.


Supports or trusses should only be worn for a short period of time. You should realize that they won't heal your hernia., Acupuncture is a traditional medicine that adjusts the body's energies by inserting slender needles into specific energy points. You may be able to manage your hernia pain by stimulating pressure points that are known to reduce pain. Find a certified acupuncturist who has experience relieving hernia pain.Acupuncture may relieve your hernia pain, but you should still seek medical treatment to treat the actual hernia.

, If you suspect you have a hernia, you feel any unusual mass in your abdomen or groin, or you have hyperacidity or heartburn, make an appointment to see your doctor. Most hernias can be diagnosed by a physical exam and review of symptoms. If you've already seen your doctor, but your symptoms haven't improved after a few weeks, contact your doctor for another appointment.


If you are experiencing unusual pain with your hernia and you have been diagnosed with a abdominal, inguinal or femoral hernia, call your physician or the ER right away-- the pain could indicate a medical emergency.

, Although you can manage your hernia pain at home, you won't be able to treat the hernia. Talk with your doctor about surgery options. Your doctor may recommend a surgical procedure where a surgeon operates to push the protruding muscle back into place. Or, a surgeon may do a less invasive procedure where small incisions are made in order to repair the hernia with a synthetic mesh.If your hernia doesn't bother you often and your doctor believes it to be small, the doctor may not recommend surgery.

, If you're experiencing heartburn from a hiatal hernia, put less pressure on your stomach. To do this, eat smaller portions of food in each sitting. You should also eat slowly so that your stomach digests food easier and faster. This can also reduce pressure on the stomach sphincter (LES), a muscle that is already weakened.Try to avoid eating 2 to 3 hours before going to bed. This will prevent food from putting pressure on your stomach muscles as you try to fall asleep.
You may also want to change your diet to reduce excess stomach acid. Avoid high fat foods, chocolate, peppermint, alcohol, onions, tomatoes, and citrus., Wear clothing that doesn’t constrict your stomach or abdomen. Avoid wearing tight clothing or belts. Instead, choose tops that are loose around your waist. If you do wear a belt, adjust it so that it doesn't tightly hug your waist.When you constrict your stomach or abdomen, you can cause recurrent hernias and make hyperacidity worse. The acid in your stomach can be forced back into your esophagus.

, If you're overweight, you're putting extra pressure on your stomach and abdominal muscles. This extra pressure can increase your risk for developing another hernia. It can also make acid in your stomach back up into your esophagus. This can cause reflux and hyperacidity.Try to lose weight slowly. Aim to lose no more than a pound or two a week. Talk to your doctor about adjusting your diet and exercise plan.

, Since you shouldn't lift heavy things or strain, try to do exercises that strengthen and support your muscles. Lay flat on your back and try one of the following stretches:


Bring your knees up so that your legs are slightly bent. Place a pillow in between your legs and use your thigh muscles to squeeze the pillow. Relax your muscles and repeat this stretch ten times.
Keep your hands at your sides and lift your knees off the ground and into the air. Using both legs, do a pedaling motion in the air. Keep doing this until you feel muscle strain in your abdomen.
Bring your knees up so that your legs are slightly bent. Place your hands on the back of your head and bend your torso up by about 30 degrees. Your torso should be closer to your knees. Hold this position and carefully recline. You can repeat this 15 times.

, If you're experiencing reflux, try to stop smoking. Smoking can increase your stomach acid, making the reflux worse. And, if you're planning on getting surgery to treat your hernia, your doctor will most likely advise you to quit smoking in the months leading up to the surgery.


Smoking will make it harder for your body to heal after the surgery and it can raise your blood pressure during the surgery. Smoking also increases your risk for developing recurrent hernias and infection from surgery., This plant (considered to be a weed) has traditionally been used to relieve swelling and pain. Apply shepherd's purse essential oil to the area where you're feeling hernia pain. You could also purchase shepherd's purse supplements to take it orally. Always follow the manufacturer's dosing instructions.Studies have shown that shepherd's purse is an anti-inflammatory.It can also prevent infection.

, If you're experiencing nausea, vomiting, and reflux caused by your hernia, drink a ginger tea. Ginger is anti-inflammatory and soothes the stomach. Steep ginger tea bags or cut up 1 teaspoon of fresh ginger. Steep the fresh ginger in boiling water for 5 minutes. It's especially helpful to drink ginger tea about half an hour before eating. It's also safe for pregnant and nursing women.Consider drinking fennel tea to settle your stomach and reduce the acid in your stomach. Crush up a teaspoon of fennel seeds and steep them in a cup of boiling water for 5 minutes. Drink 2 to 3 cups a day.
You can also drink powdered or prepared mustard dissolved in water or drink chamomile tea. All of these are anti-inflammatory and can calm your stomach by reducing acid., Look for licorice root (deglycyrrhizinated licorice root) in chewable tablet form. Licorice root has been shown to heal the stomach while controlling hyperacidity. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions. This usually means taking 2 or 3 tablets every 4 to 6 hours.Be aware that licorice root can cause a lack of potassium in your body, which can lead to heart arrhythmias. Talk to your doctor if you take large quantities of licorice or use it for more than two weeks.
Slippery elm is another herbal supplement to try as a drink or tablet. It coats and soothes irritated tissues and is safe to use during pregnancy., If you have severe reflux, you might try drinking apple cider vinegar. Some believe that the extra acid will tell your body to reduce its own acid production in a process called feedback inhibition although more research is needed. Mix 1 tablespoon of organic apple cider vinegar to 6 ounces of water and drink it.If you like, you can also add a bit of honey to improve the flavor.


A variation of this approach is to make you own lemonade or limeade. Just mix a few teaspoons of pure lemon or lime juice and add water to taste. If you want, add a bit of honey to the drink. Drink this before, during and after meals.

, Choose organic aloe vera juice (not gel) and drink 1/2 cup. Although you can sip this throughout the day, you should limit your daily intake to 1 to 2 cups. This is because aloe vera can act as a laxative.Studies have shown that aloe vera syrup can treat symptoms of acid reflux by reducing inflammation and neutralizing stomach acid."

Try to find a physician who is knowledgeable about herbs and supplements. Be sure to tell your doctor about any prescription medications that you are taking as well.


Herbs and supplements can interact with prescription medications by either decreasing their actions or increasing them. Naturopaths and integrative/holistic physicians are trained to balance medications and natural products.;
, Herbal medicines that may be used as pain relievers are called anodynes. Other herbal medicines that are anti-inflammatory or can be used to relax muscles may also be used to relieve pain. If you take herbs or supplements, talk to your naturopath or integrative physician first to make certain there are no potential interactions and to determine your dosage. Do not take anodynes except under the care of an experienced professional. Examples of anodynes include:Valerian root
Jamaican dogwood
California poppy
Henbane
Jimson weed
Gelsemium
Marijuana (where medical marijuana is legal)

, You may use anti-inflammatory herbs under the supervision of an experienced professional, but you can safely include anti-inflammatory culinary herbs and spices. Use anti-inflammatory culinary herbs and spices in quantities common in foods. Don’t overdo them-- just add these herbs and spices to flavor your foods. In general, that means ½ -2 teaspoons while cooking. These include:Cloves

In particular, you should try non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs come in tablet, capsule, and spray form and help to relieve pain as quickly as possible. This sort of medicine works to block prostaglandins — involved in the inflammatory process, which can cause pain. When they become blocked, inflammation is reduced, relieving pain. However, keep in mind that you should never go over the dosage directions written on the bottle of the medication. The main NSAIDs are:Ibuprofen: This is a regular NSAID — it reduces prostaglandin production and reduces muscle aches. The most common form of ibuprofen is Advil and Motrin.
Naproxen: This works to reduce inflammation caused by bone and muscle strain. It is also an effective pain reliever. The most common form of naproxen is Aleve.
Aspirin: (Not very affective) This works to reduce inflammation. Common forms of aspirin include Bayer and Excedrin. Children and teenagers should not be given aspirin without doctor's approval, as it can increase their risk of Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal condition.Acetaminophen: This drug is not an NSAID, but it helps to block pain centers in the brain and control the central nervous system. The most common form of Acetaminophen is Tylenol.;
, If you are experiencing muscle spasms that are causing pain, use a hot pack. The heat will work to soothe the pain, calm the muscle spasms, and reduce joint stiffness.Wrap the hot pack in a towel and then gently place the hot pack on the affected spot. Leave the hot pack on for 20 to 30 minutes.

, Cold compresses can be used on strained muscles. Ice is generally more useful to reduce swelling and inflammation.In the case of a cold compress, you should cover the affected area for 20 minute increments over the course of 24 hours.If you don’t have a cold compress, you can make your own by wrapping an unopened bag of frozen vegetables in a cloth.

, If you are experiencing extreme back pain, it may be your back telling you it needs to rest. Stop doing whatever activity was causing the pain and lie down or do something that is not physically demanding. Keep in mind that movement is a part of pain relief as well — you should resume doing some undemanding physical activities after the intense pain has subsided.

Do a wall stretch.,
Perform a squat stretch.,
Stretch the sole of your foot with your hands.,
Do all foot stretches gently.",How to Relieve Plantar Fasciitis Pain2," This stretch helps to lengthen and stretch your arch and Achilles tendon. Start by leaning forward against a wall, keeping one knee straight and the same leg’s heel flat on the ground. Bend your other knee. You will feel the Achilles tendon and foot arch on the straight leg stretch as you lean forward.Hold this pose for 10 seconds. Then, relax and straighten up.
Repeat 20 times with both legs.

, This stretch also focuses on your arch and tendons. Lean forward onto a counter top. Spread your feet shoulder width apart, keeping one foot in front of the other. Bend your knees and slowly squat down. Try to keep your heels on the ground for as long as you can.You will feel your Achilles tendon and foot arch stretch as you squat down.
Hold the squat for 10 to 15 seconds. Then, relax and straighten up.
Repeat 20 to 25 times.

, This stretch helps to lengthen the plantar fascia and is similar to what you will do if you wrap your foot. Cross whichever leg is affected over your other leg. Using the hand on the same side as the hurt foot, grab the sore foot and gently pull your toes back towards your shin.This creates some tension or stretch in the arch of the foot and at the plantar fascia.
Hold this stretch for 10 to 20 seconds and repeat 10 times.

, The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society recommends doing stretches that target your Achilles tendon and plantar fascia to help treat plantar fasciitis and reduce the risk of a recurring injury. For these exercises, make certain you move slowly, gently, and smoothly. Don’t make any quick movements because this may re-injure the plantar fascia.Repeat these exercises at least three times a day. Do these stretches especially after you have been sitting for a long time and when you get out of bed in the morning.

Sit in a comfortable position.,
Wrap the bandage around your ankle.,
Continue wrapping the bandage around your foot.",How to Relieve Plantar Fasciitis Pain3," The first thing you need to do when wrapping your foot is to get into a comfortable position. You can rest the affected foot on the opposite knee if that is comfortable. Make sure you have good access to your foot so you can stretch it and wrap it properly.Wrapping your foot can reduce the pain in your foot by keeping it stretched. It also helps minimize any stress and inflammation. There are night splints available at most medical supply stores, but you can often replicate these for much less money.

, Gently pull your toes up toward your head. You should feel a light stretch, but no serious pain. Place one end of the elastic bandage on the top of your foot. Keeping your foot flexed, wrap the elastic band around your foot. Then bring it around your ankle.The main goal of wrapping your foot is to keep the foot flexed with the toes pointing or pulled toward your head until you feel a stretch in the bottom of your foot. Remember this should only be a gentle stretch.

, After one wrap around your ankle, loop the elastic bandage back to your foot. Fold the bandage and slip the folded bandage between your big toe and first toe. Then pull the bandage back to the ankle. Continue wrapping around your ankle, tucking the end of the elastic bandage under the wrapped bandage when you are finished.Make sure you keep your foot flexed with toes pointed toward your head during the entire process.
You don’t have to wrap tightly. The point of the elastic bandage is not to compress but to keep your foot flexed and the plantar fascia gently stretched.
Be careful when standing up or getting out of bed. Do this slowly.

Use OTC pain medications.,
Try corticosteroids.,
Undergo surgery.",How to Relieve Plantar Fasciitis Pain4," A common way to relieve pain from plantar fasciitis is to take over-the-counter pain medication. You can use OTC anti-inflammatory medications to help decrease the inflammation and the pain in your foot. These medications include Ibuprofen, such as Advil and Motrin, and Naproxen, like Aleve.Use the medication only as directed on the package. You can take these medications for up to two weeks.

, If you have plantar fasciitis pain that doesn’t respond to any of the home treatments, you may want to see your doctor. Your doctor may suggest corticosteroids if you have pain that just won’t go away. Usually, these injections work better if done early; however, doctors usually only administer them in more severe cases.Your doctor will probably suggest other at-home methods before giving you these injections.
Multiple shots are not recommended. This can weaken your plantar fascia or diminish the pad that covers your heel bone.
Before you get an injection, you will have to get a radiograph of the food.

, In the most severe cases where the pain doesn’t decrease and the plantar fascia doesn’t heal with other treatments, a physician may suggest surgery. In the surgery, a surgeon will release your plantar fascia from the heel bone. This is the last resort option for pain.If you undergo this surgery, you may end up with a weakened foot arch.

Discuss a pain reducing exercise regimen with your doctor.,
Consider acupuncture.,
Visit a chiropractor.",How to Relieve Chronic Pain Naturally2," Mild to moderate exercise such as Tai chi, Qigong and yoga as well as walking, gardening and low-impact exercise may help to relieve chronic pain. Speak to an exercise specialist about specific types of exercises because some exercise types can make the pain worse instead of making it better.


Exercise releases natural pain killers such as endorphins. These chemicals can relieve pain as well as providing many other positive health benefits., Acupuncture has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for thousands of years. The basic concept of acupuncture is that if there is a blockage in qi (one’s life energy), then illness or pain is the result. The very thin needles used in acupuncture and the pressure in acupressure can unblock these energy pathways and restore the easy and unimpeded flow of qi.


Acupuncture has been shown to be effective for chronic pain, cutting pain levels by as much as 50%. , Practitioners of chiropractic medicine are trained in the structure and mechanics of the muscular and skeletal system, using this knowledge to correct and re-align the muscles and bones. Recent studies have indicated that chiropractic manipulation and other approaches can be very effective for low back pain, neck, shoulder, hip, and knee pain.While many chiropractors work on spinal alignment, all chiropractors are also trained to:


use manual adjustment or manipulation
provide guidance on exercises to restore strength and function
provide nutritional advice
use ultrasound and laser therapies to treat pain

Learn about the “Anti-Inflammatory Diet.” The Anti-Inflammatory diet is designed to reduce inflammation “from the inside out.”The guidelines are simple, but they may represent a significant change in your current diet.,
Increase the amounts of vegetables and fruit in your diet.Fruits and vegetables are excellent sources of vitamins, minerals and fiber.,
Limit red meats.,
Increase your intake of foods that contain omega-3 fats.,
Select complex carbohydrates.,
Drink plenty of water and stay hydrated!,
Limit high fat foods.,
Enhance your fiber intake.",How to Relieve Chronic Pain Naturally3," Start by changing those things that seem easier to you and adopt more changes as you move forward.


In general, these guidelines will increase the amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, B-vitamins like niacin and vitamins and minerals in your diet.

, Select bright colored fruits and vegetables for the highest level of antioxidants. These include:


Berries (blueberries, raspberries)
apples
plums
oranges and other citrus fruits (Vitamin C is an excellent anti-oxidant)
leafy green vegetables
winter and summer squash
bell peppers

, Corn-fed beef contains much higher levels of omega-6 (pro-inflammatory) fats, so it is best to avoid red meat if you want to adopt an anti-inflammatory diet. If you do have red meat, make sure it is grass fed and has no added antibiotics and/or hormones and limit it to 2-4 times a month. Grass-fed meat has the more natural ratio of omega-3 and omega-6 fats so it does not cause as much inflammation.Eat skinless poultry that is free-range and antibiotic-free to reduce your intake of unhealthy fats and additives.

, Fish is good quality protein and has good amounts of the healthier omega-3 fats. You can also get omega-3 fats from plant sources. Excellent sources of omega-3 fatty acids can be found in the following fish, shellfish and plants:Salmon
Tuna
Sardines
Herring
Mussels
Rainbow trout
Flaxseed
Chia seeds
Walnuts
Tofu and soybean products
Brussel sprouts and cauliflower

, Make sure you include only complex carbohydrates in your diet. The industrial processing breaks down the carbohydrates into the simple carbohydrates, which cause inflammation and may contribute to chronic pain.Limit your intake of processed and prepackaged foods to limit the additives and preservatives even further.
Go for less processed carbohydrates such as whole grain breads, brown rice and whole grain pasta.
Avoid foods with added sugar and sugar substitutes. Sugar is an inflammatory substance, so it may contribute to chronic pain.
Try using the herb stevia as a sugar substitute if you have a hard time giving up sweets.
You can still have a treat now and then, just try to limit your intake of sugar to a few times per week.

, To reduce inflammation, it is crucial to increase your intake of water. Stay away from soft drinks and alcohol because these drinks may increase inflammation. Substitute water, green tea, fruit juices, and herbal teas instead., To reduce inflammation, you should reduce your overall fat intake. Eating lots of fruits and vegetables should make it easier to consume less fat. If possible, avoid all fatty foods, such as fried foods, baked goods, fast foods, and junk foods.Limit your total fat intake to about 25-30% of your total daily calories
Use anti-inflammatory oils for cooking, such as olive oil and canola oil.

, The current recommendation for fiber is 25-30 grams per day, but many people only get 10-12 grams. Naturopaths and other holistic practitioners often recommend that people eat 40-50 grams of fiber a day. This has many health benefits in addition to reducing inflammation, such as regular bowel movements, reduced risk of colon cancer, weight management, and blood sugar control.Foods that are high in fiber include:


Brans including oats, wheat, corn and rice brans
Beans and legumes
Berries
Whole grains including barley, oats, rye, wheat, quinoa, brown and wild rice and millet.
Leafy green vegetables
Nuts and seeds

If you begin to feel pain creeping into your back, stand up as straight as you can and reach your arms above your head with your hands pointing up to the sky. This stretch will help to release pressure on your nerves caused by distorted vertebrae.
Try a split stance stretch. Step forward with the leg that appears longer. Keep your torso as upright as possible. Shift your weight to your forward knee as you bend it. As you shift, raise the arm on the opposite side from your forward leg as high as you can. Reach back with the other arm, keeping your palm up. Hold this pose for a few seconds. Do two to three sets of five to 10 reps each.

, Pain is a sign that you are doing the activity incorrectly, or that it is not good for your body right now. Any sharp pain or discomfort, tenderness, or swelling is a sign you should stop your activity immediately.Mild soreness may be common after physical activity. Soreness usually occurs after you have finished the activity, not during it, and it should be temporary.If you are not sure how to do your exercises properly, consider seeing a physical therapist.

The stretching involved will also help to relieve back pain.Consult with your doctor or physical therapist before trying pilates. Most of the time, people suffering from scoliosis pain will need to have a pilates routine tailored to their specific needs.

, As stated above, stretching can really help to relieve back pain. Yoga stretches that target pain caused by scoliosis focus on the spine, scapula, feet, legs, and abdominal muscles. Practicing yoga will help relieve pain while also promoting relaxation of the mind which can help in overcoming pain.Try triangle pose. This pose focuses on strengthening and stretching the arms, legs, and abdominal muscles. It is an excellent way to open up your core and help your spine to become more flexible.
Do a knee-to-chin press. This pose is also called Pavan Muktasana and helps increase blood flow to your hip joints while also helping the spine to relax. Lie on your back and bring to your knees to your chin. Wrap your arms around your knees and legs and remain in that position for several moments.

Perform a cat stretch. This is one of the best poses for relieving tension in the back. It will help make your back muscles strong while helping your spine to become more flexible.
Do the side plank pose. Begin in a plank pose, supporting your weight on your hands and feet. Press your weight down on your right hand and roll your body to your right. Stack your left foot on top of your right foot. Extend your left arm straight up.Hold this pose for a minimum of 10–20 seconds, or longer if you can. Do this at least once a day to relieve pain and strengthen your back."

Talk to your doctor.,
Wear a brace.,
Get surgery.",How to Relieve Back Pain from Scoliosis4," The following treatments will have to be confirmed by a doctor before they can be employed. Some types of scoliosis do not have to be treated at all as they are caused by another ailment in the body that needs to be corrected. Consult with your doctor about the steps you can take to treat your scoliosis., Braces cannot treat scoliosis, but they can slow down the progression of the effects of scoliosis. When you first start using the brace, you will need to wear the brace each day and night. However, as your time with the braces progresses, you may be able to wear it less. Braces are particularly important because they can reduce the need for surgery.If you begin wearing a brace soon after being diagnosed with scoliosis, it may keep your back from curving further. If the curve of your back stays at 25 to 40 degrees, you will not need surgery.

, If your back curves more than 40 degrees, you will most likely need to get surgery to ensure that your back stops curving. If you do not get surgery, you spine may continue to curve one to two degrees each year. You will have have to consult with your doctor about the next steps you will have to take."

Stop moving and do not put weight on the injured leg.,
Apply ice packs to the hamstring.,
Wrap your upper leg in a compression bandage or wear compression shorts.,
Elevate your leg above the level of your heart.,
Take over-the-counter pain medication.",How to Relieve Hamstring Pain1," If you injure your hamstring while doing sports or any physical activity, you should stop moving and take any weight off your leg. This will ensure you do not make the injury any worse and can protect your hamstring from further damage., Icing your hamstring will reduce any swelling or inflammation. Use ice packs or a bag of frozen peas. You can also fill a long tube sock with rice and put it in the freezer overnight, then apply it to your injured hamstring.Put the ice on your hamstring for 10–15 minutes at a time, every hour on the first 24 hours of injury. Leave the ice pack off at night while you sleep.
After the first 24 hours, ice the hamstring four to five times, or two to three hours, a day.
Once you can walk on your injured leg without any pain, you should alternate heat and cold, following the pattern: two minutes hot, one minute cold, for six cycles. Repeat the cycle twice a day.

, The compression will help to reduce any swelling in the injured area. Make sure the bandage is wrapped tightly enough around your upper leg to apply medium pressure, but not too tightly. The bandage should not cause any bulging around the injured area or stop blood flow to the area.


To put on the compression bandage, begin by wrapping the bandage high on your leg, above the injured area. Once the swelling goes down, you no longer need to wrap your injured hamstring.
If the pain around the injured area increases once you wrap it with the compression bandage, the bandage is too tight. Loosen it up or re wrap it so it is not as tight around your leg.

, Elevating your leg will help to improve blood flow to the area and reduce any pain. You should rest your leg on several pillows or a raised chair as much as possible to encourage healing.


After the first or second day of the injury, try to move a little bit every hour or so, slowly and carefully. Do not overdo your movements or put too much weight on the leg as this can make the hamstring injury worse.

, To reduce the pain and the swelling in the injured area, take OTC pain medication. You can find ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) at your local grocery store or drugstore.

Find a quiet place.,
Lie down.,
Be present in the moment.,
Focus on your breath.,
Scan over your body with your mind.,
Bring your mind back if it wanders.,
Connect your body together.,
Open your eyes.",How to Reduce Physical Pain with Meditation1," To receive the full effects of body scan meditation, find a quiet, calm room to meditate in. The point is to focus inward on your mind and body, so you want to eliminate outside distractions. Set aside at least half an hour for this.You can do this in your bedroom, living room, or any other quiet room that is free from distractions.
If you have to, ask your family or friends to not disturb you for the duration of your meditation.
Turn off your cell phone. Leave it in another room so you will not be tempted by it.;
, To do the body scan meditation, you need to lie down somewhere comfortable. This can be your bed, a mat on the floor, or anywhere else you find comfortable. Close your eyes. Either rest your hands on your torso or on the floor.Relax into the position. As you first lie there, think about where your body connects with the mat or bed. Try to soften the areas that are touching the floor. Relax any parts of your body that are holding tension, such as the neck, shoulders, or even legs.

, The first step in body scan meditation is to be present in the moment. This means removing all thought of the past or the future along with other thoughts. Concentrate only on the moment you are in.Focus only on your body. Ignore everything else.
Make sure that as you focus on your body that you let go of any negativity. Accept your body as it is in that moment. Don’t worry or stress about what’s wrong, what should be different, or what you can do in the future or what you should have done in the past. View your body positively, as a friend, not as an enemy.

, As you begin the body scan meditation, focus on your breath. Take a few moments just to breath. Feel the rhythm of your breath.In your mind, think about what your breath is like. Are they deep or smooth? Are they wheezing or loud? Where do you feel the breath in other parts of your body?

, With your mind, you should move over your body. Do this slowly, focusing on one body part at a time. Experience each body part; don’t visualize or move them. Feel the body part.Start with your left foot. Focus on the toes, the move through each part of the foot, including the heel and the sole. Move to the ankle, the calf, and the shin as you continue up the left leg. Go all the way up to the left hip and groin before you begin the same process on the right foot, starting with the toes. Continue up through the body, focusing on the pelvic region, including the hips and genitals, then up through the torso, back, the chest, and shoulders. Do each arm after the shoulders, starting with your fingers. Continue to the neck, throat, face, and head.As you think of each body part, don’t visualize it. Instead, feel and experience it. Think about whether it is cold or hot. Feel the texture and weight of the clothing on it, or the floor underneath it. Feel each sensation on the body part. If you feel pain, acknowledge the pain. If that part of your body is pain free, acknowledge that.
When you move on to the next body part, let go of the previous body part. Don’t dwell on a body part. Stay in the present, thinking about the body part you are currently on.

, Your mind will naturally wander as you lie on the floor. It will continuously wander. If your mind wanders, gently bring your mind back to the body scan meditation.If your mind wanders while you are focusing on your legs, calmly make your mind come back from where it wandered and focus again on the legs.
Remember, if this happens, stay positive and don’t criticize yourself. Instead, stay focused on the present moment in a positive way.

, After you complete the whole body scan, think about connecting your body together. Feel the foot connected to the leg, the leg connected to the hips, the hips to the torso, the torso to the arms, and so forth. End by feeling the skin that holds the body together., When you are finished, open your eyes. You should have a greater awareness about yourself, and feel more relaxed. You should also feel less pain, since much of your pain is connected to tension in your body.Body scan meditation can help you have a greater awareness of your pain after you are finished. For example, if you have chronic pain, after body scan meditation you may realize that your entire body and life is not full of pain. You have localized your pain and discovered many places in your body that are pain free."

Apply heat.,
Use a cold pack.,
Use a foam roller.,
Improve your posture.,
Set up an ergonomically correct workstation.,
Practice progressive muscle relaxation.,
Try an inversion table or chair.,
Change your mattress.",How to Relieve Back Pain Without Drugs1," Heat is commonly recommended for alleviating back pain, especially lower back pain. Heat will help your muscles relax, which can relieve tension and spasms. If your pain is chronic, or not the result of injury, heat is more likely to help.Use a hot water bottle or heating pad to apply dry heat. Wrap a hot water in a towel to avoid burns. Do not fall asleep while using a heating pad. Do not use heat applications for more than 15-20 minutes at a time.A hot shower or bath may also provide relief for some back pain. You may also find a sauna or hot tub helpful.;
, Icing or using a cold pack is not always helpful for back pain. It is usually more helpful when inflammation is involved, such as with arthritis-related back pain. Icing can also reduce swelling from injuries.To make a cold pack, wet a towel with cold water. Wring to remove excess water. Fold the towel and put it into a plastic zip-top bag. Freeze the bag for about 15 minutes. Apply to the affected area for 10 minutes. Repeat up to 3 times a day.
A bag of frozen veggies can act as a cold pack in a pinch. Try to use something fairly small and evenly shaped, such as peas or corn. This will help distribute the cold more evenly.

, Using a foam roller can help relieve muscle pain and soreness.These are usually 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8 m) long, and look like very thick pool noodles. (You can even use a large pool noodle at first.)Lie on a flat surface with the roller perpendicular to your back. Position the roller so that it just beneath your shoulder blades. Lift your hips off the ground a few inches. Keep your head and shoulders off the ground. Use your feet to roll yourself backward and forward on the roller for a few minutes.Start with a lower-density foam roller at first. Some foam rollers are very firm and may have bumps or nodules on them to get at trigger points. These may be too intense for beginners., Slouching and standing improperly can increase the pressure on your back and cause pain. Improving your posture can relieve back pressure and help soothe existing back pain. It can also help prevent recurrence of back pain.Strengthening your core muscles, as recommended in method 1, will help improve your posture. These muscles connect to your spine and pelvis and help hold your body up.Flexibility exercises, such as yoga and pilates, are another good way to improve your posture. These exercises emphasize slow, fluid motion as opposed to the sometimes herky-jerky movements of traditional exercises. Thus, they’re less likely to aggravate back pain.Pay attention to how you sit and stand throughout the day. Your shoulders should be down and back, not slumped forward. Your head should be at a level position, not bent forward or down. It may feel a little awkward to correct your posture at first, but with a little vigilance, you may begin to feel better., Back and shoulder pain can be caused by sitting long hours at a desk. Improper workstation layout can cause your head to droop and your shoulders to slump forward. Setting up an ergonomically correct workstation can help relieve your back pain.Aim to keep your feet flat on the floor. Make sure your elbows and lower back are supported.
Make sure that your monitor is at or just below eye level, so that you’re not slumping your head forward to look at it. Don’t put your keyboard and mouse too far away; stretching forward for a long period of time may put stress on your back.There is no one posture or workstation that will work for everyone. However, keeping the basic principles in mind may help relieve your back pain., Some types of back pain can be aggravated by stress and tension. Progressive muscle relaxation therapy can help you learn to relax and soothe your sore muscles.With PMR, you tense and then release groups of muscles, all while breathing deeply.PMR can lead to a feeling of relaxation and well-being.Find a calm, quiet place to do your exercises. Plan for about 15 minutes.
Make yourself comfortable. Loosen any tight clothing. Sit or lie down. If you’d like, you can play soothing music.
Begin with your facial muscles or your feet. Work down or up, accordingly.
Clench the muscles in one group as hard as you can. For example, for your forehead, raise your eyebrows as far as possible. Wrinkle your forehead. Hold this tension for 5 seconds, then relax.
Move to your eyes and nose. Close your eyes as tightly as possible. Hold the tension for 5 seconds, then relax.
Continue to tense the muscle groups along your body. Hold the tension in each group for 5 seconds before relaxing.
The major muscle groups you will work on are forehead, eyes/nose, lips/cheeks/jaw, hands, forearms, upper arms, shoulders, back, stomach, hips/buttocks, thighs, feet, and toes., An inversion table may help you stretch and decompress your spine and temporarily relieve back pain. While it’s unlikely to offer long-term relief, some people may find inversion helpful in the short term. Consult with your physician before trying inversion.Inversion raises your blood pressure when you are inverted. If you have high blood pressure, heart disease, or glaucoma, do not use inversion.Start slowly, with small degrees of inversion. Trying too much too fast could result in injury.

, If other self-care tactics haven't worked, your mattress could be contributing to your back pain. There is no one type of mattress that is “best” for people who suffer from back pain.A lot depends on your preferred sleeping position. Changing your mattress may help relieve back pain, especially if your mattress is saggy or unsupportive.


Consumer guides such as Consumer Reports often rate mattresses by sleeping position.You can also find mattress-buying guides that will help you figure out what your mattress needs might be.Try out mattresses in person before buying them. What works for one person may not work for another. Find the mattress that is comfortable to you.
You can also use pillows and cushions to improve your sleeping position. If you sleep on your back, put a pillow beneath your knees to offer support. If you sleep on your side, put a pillow between your knees to maintain a neutral spine position. Try to avoid sleeping on your stomach. It can twist and put tension on back muscles."

Talk to a physician about more invasive options.",How to Relieve Neck Pain," Your cervical spine (neck) is a complex collection of bones, joints, ligaments, nerves, muscles and blood vessels.As such, there are many structures that can generate pain if you move your neck the wrong way or experience some trauma, such as whiplash. Significant neck pain can come on quickly but it can sometimes go away just as quickly (without any treatment) because the body has a fantastic ability to sort itself out and heal. Thus, be patient for a few hours if you experience a bout of neck pain, avoid any strenuous or irritating activities and keep a positive attitude.


Neck injury symptoms that indicate you should immediately seek medical attention include: severe neck pain that gets progressively worse, muscle weakness and/or loss of sensation in your arms, throbbing headache, blurry vision, loss of balance and/or nausea.Resting your stiff or painful neck is a good idea, but completely immobilizing it in a neck collar or brace is not recommended for most injuries — it promotes weak muscles and less mobile joints. At least some gentle neck movement is needed to encourage blood flow and stimulate healing.
If your neck pain is exercise-related, you may be working out too aggressively or with bad form — talk to a personal trainer.;
, The application of cold therapy is an effective treatment for essentially all acute (recent) musculoskeletal injuries, including neck pain.Cold therapy (whether it be ice, a frozen gel pack or a bag of veggies from the freezer) should be applied to the most painful part of your neck in order to reduce inflammation and pain. The cold causes the local blood vessels to constrict, which prevents excessive swelling, and it numbs small nerve fibers. Apply Cold therapy for 15 minutes every hour for the first three to four hours post injury, then reduce the frequency as the pain and swelling subside.


Compressing the ice (heat aswell)against your neck with a stretchy bandage or elastic wrap will also help combat inflammation, but be careful not to completely cut off circulation.
Wrap frozen items in a thin towel in order to prevent skin irritation or frostbite on your neck.
Acute pain typically lasts for less than a few weeks, but can transition into chronic pain if it lingers for a few months or longer.
Keep in mind that cold therapy may not be appropriate for chronic (long-term) neck pain that doesn't involve much inflammation — applying moist heat may provide more relief.

, If your neck pain has become chronic (lasting for a few months or longer) and feels more stiff and achy instead of inflamed and painful, then avoid cold therapy and apply moist heat.Microwavable herbal bags are tailor made for neck pain and work well for relaxing the tension in muscles and reducing achiness in spinal joints, especially those products that are infused with aromatherapy (such as lavender or rosemary). Unlike an acutely injured neck, chronic neck stiffness benefits from the increased blood flow that heat provides. Apply the herbal bag for about 20 minutes at a time, up to 3x daily.


As an alternative, soak your chronically sore neck and shoulders in a hot Epsom salt bath for 20 minutes. The hot water improves circulation and the magnesium-rich salt works well to reduce ligament and tendon tension, joint stiffness and pain.Applying some form of moist heat to your neck just prior to performing stretches (see below) is a good idea in most instances because it will make the muscles more pliable and less likely to become more strained.

, Consider taking over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin for acute neck issues, but keep in mind they are best used as short-term solutions to help you deal with inflammation and pain.These drugs can be hard on your stomach and kidneys, so try not to use them for more than 2 weeks at a stretch. Always remember that aspirin and ibuprofen are not appropriate for young children to take.


Alternatively, if your neck is more stiff then inflamed, you can try over-the-counter analgesics such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), which is much easier on your stomach, but can negatively impact your liver.
If muscle spasm or guarding is a major element of your neck pain (common with whiplash injuries), then consider taking muscle relaxants such as cyclobenzaprine, but never take them concurrently with NSAIDs. Check whether muscle relaxants are available over-the-counter where you live.
As a general guideline, achy pain is usually indicative of a muscle pull or tightness, whereas sharp pain with movement is often caused by joint / ligament injuries.

, Whatever is triggering your neck pain, chances are that the surrounding muscles are reacting to it by getting tight and restricting movement. Therefore, as long as you don't feel sharp, electric or stabbing pain with neck movements (which may indicate a disc herniation or a bone fracture), then light neck stretches are likely of benefit. Sore and tight muscles respond well to stretching because it reduces muscle tension and improves flexibility.Doing stretches and neck movements after a warm shower is helpful, regardless if your neck pain is acute or chronic.


Good mobilizations to start with include shoulder rolls and circular movements with your head. Then progress to neck rotations (looking side to side) and flexion / extensions (looking up and down). Spend a few minutes on each set of movements.
Once your neck is warmed up, start stretching by laterally flexing your neck and head, — trying to bring your ear closer to your shoulder. Do both sides. Then flex your neck forward (chin to chest) and slightly rotate it to the side until you're staring down at your foot. Switch and do the other side.
Hold all neck stretches for about 30 seconds per side while deeply breathing and do them three to five times daily until the pain diminishes.
Always stretch or move your neck within pain tolerance. If you stretch your neck and feel pain, gradually bring your neck back to where you don't feel any pain. Do not stretch beyond that point.
Over time, your range of pain-free motion will gradually increase.

, Stomach sleeping is a common cause of neck and shoulder pain because the neck gets twisted to the side for long periods of time to allow for breathing. Excessive neck twisting irritates the small spinal facet joints, ligaments, tendons and nerves of the neck. The best sleeping position for your neck is either on your back or on your side (similar to the classic fetal position).Stomach sleeping is a difficult habit to break for some people, but the benefits to your neck and the rest of your spine are worth the effort to switch positions.


While on your back, don't prop your head up with more than one pillow as the increased neck flexion can lead to pain.
While on your side, choose a pillow that isn't much thicker than the distance from the tip of your shoulder to your ear. Pillows that are too thick cause too much lateral flexion in the neck.
Consider buying a special orthopedic pillow for your neck — they are designed to support the normal curves of your neck and prevent any irritation or strain / sprain while you sleep.

, As noted above, virtually all neck injuries involve the muscles to some extent, so addressing the tight or spasming muscles is a sensible strategy for relieving neck pain. A deep tissue massage is helpful for mild-to-moderate strains because it reduces muscle spasm, combats inflammation and promotes relaxation.Start with a 30 minute massage, focusing on your neck, upper shoulder and base of your skull. Allow the therapist to go as deep as you can tolerate it without wincing.


Always drink lots of water right after a deep tissue massage in order to flush out inflammatory by-products and lactic acid from your body. Not doing so might trigger a headache or mild nausea.
A single massage may greatly relieve acute neck pain, depending on its cause and degree of seriousness, but sometimes a few more sessions are required. For chronic neck pain, longer-duration (one hour) and more frequent massages (three times per week) may be needed to ""break the cycle of chronicity"" and trigger healing.

, Chiropractors and osteopaths are spine specialists who focus on establishing normal movement and function within the small spinal facet joints that connect the vertebrae of the spinal column together. They will examine your neck and try to determine the cause of your pain, whether it's more muscle related or more joint related. Manual joint manipulation, also called a spinal adjustment, can be used to reposition facet joints in the neck that are slightly jammed or misaligned, which triggers inflammation and sharp pain (particularly with movement).


Chiropractors and osteopaths often take neck x-rays to better understand your condition and to make sure a spinal adjustment is appropriate and safe.
Although a single adjustment can sometimes completely relieve neck pain, more than likely it will take three to five treatments to notice significant results. Your health insurance may not cover chiropractic care, so check your policy.
Chiropractors and osteopaths use a variety of other therapies tailored more towards muscle strains, which may be more appropriate for your neck issue.

, If your neck pain is recurring (chronic) and caused by weak spinal muscles, poor posture or degenerative conditions such as osteoarthritis, then you need to consider undertaking some spinal rehabilitation. A physiotherapist can show you specific and tailored stretches and strengthening exercises for your neck, which is especially important when recovering from serious injuries such as severe whiplash from car accidents.Physiotherapy involving spinal rehabilitation is usually required two to three times per week for four to eight weeks to positively impact chronic or serious neck issues.


In addition to strengthening exercises and stretches, physiotherapists can also use devices to treat your neck pain, such as electronic muscle stimulation (EMS), therapeutic ultrasound and/or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).
Good strengthening exercises for your neck include swimming, rowing and abdominal crunches, but make sure your pain is under control first.

, Your muscle pain might be caused by a tight knot of muscle you can't relax, or a ""trigger point."" This is especially true of more chronic neck conditions. The trigger point will feel dense and tight to the touch, like a rope or a knot.To relieve this pain, find a specialist certified in trigger point therapy. Otherwise, you can attempt some simple treatments at home.A trigger point therapist may be a massage therapist, physical therapist, chiropractor and even a physician.
To treat a trigger point yourself, try laying down on your back on a mat on the floor. Take a tennis ball and place it under your back, positioning it beneath the trigger point. Use your own weight to apply pressure to the trigger point. If this is too painful, you are using too much pressure. The feeling as you work out the knot should be strong and satisfying; you might describe it as ""hurting so good.""

, Acupuncture involves inserting very thin needles into specific energy points within your skin in efforts to reduce pain and inflammation.Acupuncture for neck pain can be very effective, especially if it's done when your acute symptoms first occur. Based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture works by triggering the body to release various substances, including endorphins and serotonin, which act to reduce pain. Acupuncture has a strong safety record and is relatively affordable, so it's worth a try for your neck pain if other treatments don't work.


There is mixed scientific evidence that acupuncture is helpful in relieving chronic neck and back pain, but there's numerous anecdotal reports that suggest it can be a viable treatment option.Keep in mind that the acupuncture points used to reduce your neck pain may not be located in or near the neck — some points can be in distant areas of the body.
Acupuncture is now practiced by a variety of healthcare professionals including some physicians, chiropractors, physiotherapists and massage therapists — but whoever you choose should be certified by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine., If your neck pain does not respond to home remedies or other more conservative (alternative) therapies, then consult with your family doctor about more invasive treatments, such as corticosteroid injections and/or surgical options. A corticosteroid injection into an inflamed neck joint, muscle or tendon can quickly reduce inflammation and pain, and allow for greater range of motion and function.However, steroidal injections should not be given more than a few times per year due to side effects, such as muscle / tendon weakening and compromised immune function. Neck surgery should be considered only as a last resort, although it's obviously indicated for fractures and dislocations caused from either trauma or osteoporosis (brittle bones from lack of minerals). Other conditions of the neck that often warrant surgery include intervertebral disc herniations (""slipped"" disc), severe inflammatory arthritis and bone infection (osteomyelitis).


Your doctor may take x-rays, CT scans, MRI, diagnostic ultrasound or a nerve conductance study to better understand the cause and seriousness of your neck pain.
If surgery is indicated, your family doctor will refer your to an orthopedic surgeon who specializes in spinal pathology.

From week 9, do squats to strengthen the knees.,
From week 13, practice jogging on a treadmill.",How to Rehab Your Knee After ACL Surgery," In the hours following surgery, a knee brace will be place around your knee to support and stabilize it. This knee brace should be worn over the next 4 to 6 weeks, while your knee is at rest (i.e. it shouldn't be worn while you are performing rehabilitation exercises). Make sure the brace is worn around the kneecap and that it is secured tightly.;
, For the first week following surgery, your knee will be placed in a passive motion machine (CPM). This machine keeps your leg elevated above heart level, in order to prevent swelling. The CPM can also be adjusted to bend your knee at a 0 to 30 degree angle, which is the first step in knee rehabilitation., It's necessary to take pain medication following knee surgery to relieve pain and bring down and inflammation or swelling. Aside from being unpleasant, pain and swelling can actually be detrimental to proper recovery, as it weakens the muscles surrounding the knee joint and causes the knee to become weak and stiff. A drug called Ketorolac is commonly prescribed in the days immediately following surgery.

, If your knee starts to swell following the surgery, you can bring down the swelling by applying an ice pack. The coldness of the ice constricts the blood vessels, leading to decreased fluid around the knee. Ice packs should only be applied for 20 minutes at a time to prevent the ice from melting and the wound from becoming wet. Take a break after each 20 minute period, then reapply the ice pack once the knee has warmed up again.

, Placing pillows behind your knee to elevate or support it is a bad idea, as it will prevent the knee from straightening properly. Straightening the knee is an essential part of knee rehabilitation, otherwise follow-up surgery may be required. If you wish to support or elevate your leg, try placing a pillow beneath your heel instead, as this will aid the straightening process.

, As mentioned above, the ability to fully straighten the knee is crucial to successful recovery. Straightening the knee helps to bring down swelling, leading to faster recovery time. Try the following led straightening exercises:


Sit down with your legs extended in front of you and place a towel underneath the ankle of the injured leg to help to keep it straight. Lock the knee and hold it for six seconds before relaxing. This counts as 1 repetition. Do 3 sets of 10 repetitions with one-minute rests in between. You shouldn't feel any pain while performing this exercise.
Lie down, keeping the injured leg straight and the “healthy” leg bent. Lift the injured leg vertically until it is in line with the height of the other kneecap. Avoid lifting the knee so high that it causes pain. Do 3 sets of 10 repetitions with one-minute rest in between.

, Heel slides are an example of a range of movement exercise (ROM) which allows the leg to go through its natural movement with minimal stress or resistance. The heel slides help the knee to regain its bending movement, using only muscle tension as resistance.Lie down with your legs extended straight in front of you. You'll find the exercise easier if you lie on a smooth surface and wear socks, as this decreases friction between the heel and the floor.
Slowly draw the heel of your injured leg towards your body by bending the knee. The heel should be in contact with the floor at all times, while the healthy leg remains straight.

, Wall slides are another ROM exercise which allow you to practice bending your knee while bearing the weight of your body.


Stand approximately one foot away from a wall and lean back against the wall while keeping the legs straight. Keep the back of your head, shoulder blades, and butt in contact with the wall at all times during the exercise.
Suck in your abdomen while breathing in a relaxed manner. This engages the core muscles, which is important in preventing ACL re-injury.
Slowly slide your back down the wall by bending the knees — it may help to pretend that you are sitting in an imaginary chair. Keep going until you start to feel resistance in your knees, but don't allow it to become painful.
Rise back up to the starting position, maintaining proper posture. This counts as one repetition. Do 3 sets of 10 repetitions while resting for a minute between sets.

, Pillow squats are an example of a functional exercise that helps to improve weight bearing, balance, and coordination. In addition, these squats help to strengthen the vastus medialis obliquus (VMO), a teardrop-shaped muscle that is essential in stabilizing the knee joint.


Stand tall with your feet one hip-width apart. Suck in the abdomen and keep the shoulder blades back and down. This posture provides a steady base for the exercise while keeping the core active.
Fold a thick pillow in half and squeeze it between your knees to hold it firmly in place. This activates the VMO muscle.
Hinge your hips and bend your knees, pushing your butt out as if you were about to sit down. Keep going until your knees are halfway from being parallel to the ground. Don't try to go any further — a half-squat is sufficient to train the VMO.
Return to starting position. Do 3 sets of 10 repetitions with a minute of rest between sets.

, Exercising underwater provides a low impact workout for your knee, which helps to strengthen in without straining it. One of the simplest, yest most effective pool exercises you can try is pool walking:


Pool walking allows your knees to readjust to the patterns of normal walking, without putting too much pressure on the knee joints. All you need to do is walk from one end of the pool to the other until you feel tired.
Gradually work your way up to 30 minutes of walking per session. Try to incorporate one or two pool sessions into your weekly rehabilitation routine.

, Ultrasound therapy transmits high frequency waves to the soft tissues underneath the skin, including the ligaments and tendons.


These sound waves help to rejuvenate the soft tissues and produce heat within them, which promotes better flexibility and speeds up the healing process.
Ask your doctor or physical therapist about receiving ultrasound therapy.

, Balance and coordination is often affected following a knee injury. Therefore, it is important to perform balance exercises to regain proper balance and coordination. One good balance exercise is single-leg balancing, where the entire weight of the body is shifted from one leg to the other (ideally without falling). Here’s how to do it:


Stand up straight and lift your good leg off the floor, maintaining balance with the affected leg. Keep the eyes looking straight ahead, your shoulder blades back and down, and your abs sucked in.
Maintain this position for 10 seconds. Repeat for 3 times with the affected leg and repeat once with the good leg.
Stop the exercise whenever you wobble. The body must be maintained in an upright stance. This exercise may sound easy, but it can be extremely challenging for patients recovering from ACL surgery.

, Loop band squats are an example of a functional exercise that helps to build up lower body strength. With these types of exercises, resistance is gradually added to build up the strength of ligaments, muscles, and tendons surrounding the knee joint.


Stand tall with the feet hip-width apart and place loop bands at the level of the knee joints. Loop bands put inward pressure on the knees, forcing the knees to oppose the pressure by pushing outward. This reaction activates the VMO muscles instantly.
Hinge your hips and bend your knees, pushing your butt backwards as of sitting into a chair. The goal is to reach a level where your thighs are parallel to the ground, however if you feel any pain or start to wobble, don't go any further.
Return to starting position. Do 3 sets of 10 repetitions with one-minute rests.

, Forward lunges are an example of a unilateral exercise, which is used to train your injured leg to bear the same amount of weight as the healthy leg. This is important, as your body tends to naturally shift its weight to the good leg following an injury.


Stand tall and take one step forward with your injured leg, until there is approximately a foot of space between your feet. Lift the heel of the rear foot, so that only the ball of the rear foot is touching the ground.
Shift your body weight onto the front foot as you descend. Keep going until the thigh of the front leg is parallel to the ground, but don't allow the front kneecap to extend beyond the toes, as this increases stress to the knee joint.
Return to the starting position, then repeat for 3 sets of 10 repetitions with 1-minute rests in between, before switching feet., Plank exercises are used to strengthen and trim the core. Although this may seem unnecessary when rehabilitating a knee injury, core exercises are very important, as a strong core alleviates the burden on the knee joints. Core exercises also help you to keep your upper body trim, which spares the knees from excessive daily wear and tear.


Assume a push-up position, keeping your hands directly beneath the shoulders and the feet together. Your head, shoulder blades, and butt must form one-straight horizontal line.
Brace the abdomen as if you are about to be punched in the gut. Try to keep it tucked in, as this helps to maintain the proper hip positioning throughout the exercise.
Hold this position for 10 seconds, then relax. Repeat this exercise 3 times with 30 second rest periods in between.Over time, you can work your way up to holding the plank position for 30 seconds each time.

, Bent-over dumbbell rows train the back and core muscles, while also engaging the lower body muscles. To perform bent-over dumbbell rows:


Stand up straight with your feet one hip-width apart and your knees slightly bent. Hold a ten-pound dumbbell in each hand. Ten pound dumbbells are usually challenging enough for beginners while maintaining proper form, but you can use a higher weight if strength allows.
Bend at the waist by pushing your hips back and your butt out, as if you were closing a door with your butt. Stop when you feel a stretch in the hamstrings (the muscles at the back of the thighs). Remember to keep your abs braced throughout the exercise.
Try to maintain the natural arch of your back, don't allow it to become hunched over. Squeeze your shoulder blades together to engages all of the muscle fibers in your back.
Pull the dumbbells up to the level of your rib cage, squeezing your shoulder blades closer together at the top of the movement. Lower the dumbbells and repeat. Do 3 sets of 10 repetitions while resting for 1 minute between sets.

, Stationary biking is a good cardiovascular exercise that keeps the muscles, ligaments, and tendons warm and active, without putting too much pressure or strain on the knees. Start with zero resistance and work your way up to cycling for 30 minutes at a time., Six weeks after your ACL surgery you should continue to perform all of the exercises from previous weeks, as they are all essential for the proper rehabilitation of the knee. However, you should aim to increase the difficulty level and intensity of each exercise by increasing the resistance level or number of repetitions for each.

, From week six onward, it's a good idea to incorporate some lateral movement exercises into your rehab routine. Up to this point, the focus of the exercises has been on the forward and backward movement of the knee. However, it is important to note that the knee moves in a 3-dimensional plane. Therefore, lateral movement exercises — such as loop band side steps — is essential for knee stability.


then stand in an athletic stance with your knees slightly bent and your butt pushed back and out. Keep your upper body upright with your chest out.
Wrap a loop band around the ankles, then step sideways towards the right while keeping the toes pointing forward. Take five steps towards the right, maintaining an athletic stance at all times.
Take five steps in the opposite direction, towards the left. Repeat the entire exercise two more times, taking a full minute's rest between each repetition.

, After 9 weeks have passed, you will have reached the final stages of the rehabilitation process. At this point it's just a matter of fine tuning your knee by strengthening any weak angles that may have been neglected thus far. One good exercise for this is pausing squats.


Stand tall with an erect posture and your abs braced. The feet should be one hip-width apart.
Push your hips back and bend the knees, as if you were sitting into a chair. Keep lowering yourself down until your thighs are parallel to the ground, then hold this position for 3 seconds.
Holding the position creates tension and recruits more muscle fibers, helping to strengthens them.
After three seconds, return to starting position. Do 3 sets of 10 reps with one minute of rest between each set.

, From week 13 onward, you should have regained more or less full movement in your knee, provided there were no problems or setbacks during the rehabilitation process. As a result, you should be able to start jogging on a treadmill.


For the first few sessions, your jogging will need to be supervised by a physiologist who will watch you carefully to ensure that you maintain the correct form while running.
From this observation, the physiologist will determine whether your knees are ready for running outdoors, on harder terrain. This will allow you to resume your regular strength training and cardiovascular exercise routine.
However, you will need to undergo a return-to-sport strength preparation course before you can participate in sports. This protects the knees from future injuries by preparing them with movements that mimic the sport’s movement."

See a doctor if you cannot put any weight at all on the injured leg or if you are in severe pain.,
Get a referral for a massage therapist or a physical therapist.,
Talk to the doctor about surgery if the hamstring is torn or detached from the bone.",How to Relieve Hamstring Pain2," The doctor will do a physical exam of the leg and talk to you about how the injury occurred. She may also do imaging testing, such as an X-ray, an MRI, or an ultrasound to check for more severe injuries.


You should also see your doctor if the injured area is still painful despite the use of home care for five to seven days.

, If your injury is severe, your doctor may recommend a massage therapist or a physical therapist. The physical therapist may then apply electrotherapy to the injury using ultrasound, laser, and pulse shortwave.


The therapist may also recommend stretches that you can do before any physical activity to prevent another hamstring injury.
She may also suggest using a foam roller to stretch and massage your hamstring once you can walk on the injured leg without any pain. The foam roller is a foam tube that you can put under the injured leg. You can then roll back and forth on the foam roller to massage your hamstring. You can find a video on how to use the foam roller here., Your doctor may recommend surgery on your hamstring if the muscle is seriously injured, with a tear of the muscle or a detachment of the muscle from the bone.During the procedure, the surgeon will pull your hamstring muscle back into place and remove any scar tissue. She will then reattach the tendon to the bone using stitches or staples. If you have a complete tear within your hamstring muscle, it will need to be sewn back together with stitches.
During recovery from the surgery, you should keep weight off of your injured leg and use crutches to get around. You may also need to wear a brace so your hamstring stays in a relaxed position. Your doctor will likely suggest a physical therapy program that involves gentle stretches and strengthening exercises. It usually takes about six months to recover from proximal hamstring reattachment surgery, and three months to recover from distal hamstring re-attachments. Your doctor can also give you a timeline of when you can return to normal use of your injured leg.

You can do static hamstring stretches, where you are seated on the floor, as well as standing hamstring stretches.Dynamic stretching done prior to activity has been shown to reduce injury.Dynamic stretching, done prior to activity, is designed to increase circulation and slowly warm up the muscles, which may be the key reasons for preventing further injury.

, If you have a history of hamstring pulls, this may mean you have weakened hamstrings and are more prone to hamstring injuries. Try not to put too much stress on your hamstring muscles while doing physical activity.Be conscious of how you are moving and stretching your hamstrings to prevent injuring it again. This may mean not over stretching your hamstring while stretching or supporting your leg with a brace while doing physical activity so you are not putting any stress on your hamstring.
You may also do an alternative physical movement in a fitness class that will not put stress on your hamstring. Talk to the instructor before class about your injury and any modifications you can do in the class to prevent overexerting your hamstring.

, Yoga and pilates are good for improving your overall flexibility, as well as your hamstring flexibility. Stronger, more flexible hamstrings are less prone to injury.


If you are recovering from a hamstring injury and are cleared to strength train, look into starting the Norwegian hamstring exercise program. This program was designed in 2001 and shown to reduce the risk of acute hamstring injuries in football players by 50%."

Stand and focus on the sensations.,
Move your arms.,
Rotate your wrists.,
Rotate your shoulders and head.,
Hug yourself.",How to Reduce Physical Pain with Meditation2," Begin your mindful movement meditation by standing straight, legs shoulder-width apart. Close your eyes. Then, start to focus on the sensations of your body. Pay attention to your breath and to the way your body feels as it stands there.Identify places in your body that feel tense, painful, or uncomfortable.

, Focusing on your breathing, move your arms up and down. As you breathe in, lift your arms, and as you exhale, lower your arms.

Get comfortable.,
Identify the pain.,
Be present.,
Focus on your breathing.,
Notice your pain.,
Stay here for a few moments.,
End the meditation.",How to Reduce Physical Pain with Meditation3," To go through these breathing exercises, you need to get in a comfortable position. This can be sitting down and lying down. Make sure you sit or lie down somewhere comfortable, like a bed, comfortable chair, or a mat on the floor.Place your hands either loosely by your side with the palms facing up or resting lightly on your torso. The key is to be comfortable.
Make sure your body is not tense. Soften any places that might be tense, like your shoulders or jaw.
Settle into the position, feeling all the places where your body connects with the surface beneath you.

, Make a note of the pain you feel. Where is the pain? What does this pain feel like? How are you reacting to this pain? Bring awareness to the pain so you can deal with it through the next steps of your meditation., Focus only on this moment. Let go of the past and the future. Focus only on the moment where you are. Be aware of the physical sensations of your body, from the temperature, to where it touches the surface beneath you, to the clothes you’re wearing, to any pain or discomfort.Focus on your thoughts and feelings in this moment. Try to keep it about this particular moment, not the past or present.
Refrain from passing judgment on your feelings, thoughts, or physical sensations. One of the keys of meditation is to become aware without passing judgment. Get rid of all criticism and negativity in your mind. Replace it with positivity. Be kind to yourself.

, Next, breathe. Don’t try to breathe differently, but just let yourself breathe naturally. Notice the way you breathe. Listen to the sounds, and notice how it feels physically.Think about how your chest and abdomen responds to your breath. Think about how the breaths feel as you inhale and exhale. Notice any details about them.
Remember to stay non-judgmental. You are only observing and not making any judgments about your breathing. You are just breathing and being in the moment.

, After you have focused solely on your breathing for a few minutes, start broadening your awareness to other parts of your body. Focus on your pain. Wrap your mental awareness around that pain. As you breathe in and out, allow the breaths to soften your pain, massage those areas, and take away the rough edges.As your wrap your breath around the pain, put kindness, love, and gentleness into those breaths. Treat your pain as you treat someone you love who is in pain.

If this gets too intense for you, expand your awareness back to your whole body and focus on relaxing and settling down into the surface beneath you.

, Remain with your mind and breath focused on your pain as you soothe and soften the pain. You may continuously broaden your awareness and bring it back to the pain as the pain sensations change.Expand your sensations broader than yourself and your pain. Try to find pleasant sensations and experiences around you. This can be the way your legs rest on the floor, the feeling of your breath, the softness of your shirt, or the sun on your face.

, After you have focused on your breath and pain for as long as you want, end the meditation. To do this, expand your mind from the pain and your breath to your body, then the world around you.

Reduce stress.,
Use meditation any time you need it.,
Adjust your thoughts about pain.,
Acknowledge the pain.",How to Reduce Physical Pain with Meditation4," Pain can cause stress, anxiety, and helpless feelings. You may feel upset about your pain all the time, which causes tension and stress, which feeds your pain. Pain and stress are a vicious cycle. Meditation is a proven stress-reliever, and reducing stress can help your pain. It can also help to calm both your body and mind., Meditation can be used any time you feel pain. Since meditation helps you refocus your mental energies away from your pain, you can meditate even when you are out in public or surrounded by people. For the best results, meditate every day. This helps keep the effects from lessening.Deep breathing and even certain mindful meditation movements can be done whenever you feel pain. At first, it may be harder to concentrate in public places or busy situations, but the more you practice these techniques, the easier they will become.
You can meditate as often as you like with any of the three methods. If you find that meditation helps reduce your pain, you can meditate four to six times a day.

, One of the things meditation offers is a way to rethink your concept of pain. For people who suffer pain, it dominates a lot of their life, and the pain takes on a life of its own. Meditation can help you understand that pain is a sensation, not a larger entity. Meditation helps you learn how to deal with the pain by controlling your emotional response to it.Focusing on your body helps you localize the pain. Many times, pain feels like it is everywhere in the body. Meditation can help you adjust those thoughts. Instead of the pain being in your whole body, you begin to understand it is only in certain parts of your body, leaving most of your body pain free.

, Meditation helps you acknowledge pain. If you try to ignore the pain, it might consume your thoughts or feel worse. With meditation, you can learn to be aware of your pain without judging yourself or focusing on it. You acknowledge the pain alongside everything else at that you experience in the same moment. This includes good things.By acknowledging your pain and everything else you experience at the same time, pain becomes only one of many things going on for you. If you can focus your awareness to the pain, but also the sun on your face, the smell of food cooking, the sound of birds chirping, the feeling of someone near you, you realize pain is a small part of your experience at every given moment.
Doing this helps you lessen the power pain has over you, giving you control over your life and the moment.

Know your limits.,
Recognize severe symptoms.,
Try massage therapy.,
Consider spinal manipulation.,
Consider acupuncture.,
Consider cognitive-behavioral therapy.",How to Relieve Back Pain Without Drugs2," In general, acute back pain will improve on its own with proper self-care. Lower back pain is particularly common among adults. If your back pain does not improve after 4 weeks, see a doctor. You may need to consider other treatment options.Common causes of back pain include arthritis, degenerative disc disease, and other nerve and muscular problems. If your back pain persists, see a doctor., A lot of back pain can be managed on your own, or with complementary treatments. However, if you have certain symptoms, your back pain could be a sign of more severe health issues. Seek medical attention immediately if you have any of the following symptoms:Pain extending from the back down the leg
Pain gets worse when you bend over or bend your legs
Pain gets worse at night, or wakes you up
Fever with back pain
Back pain with bladder or bowel trouble
Back pain with numbness or weakness in the legs

, Regular massage has been shown to relieve back pain and disability.Massage is especially helpful at providing fairly quick back pain relief; one study demonstrated that weekly massage treatments significantly improved back pain and function after 10 weeks compared to typical back pain care routines.Some health insurance companies and health providers will cover “medical massage” when you are referred by your doctor to a licensed massage therapist for treatment. Talk with your doctor to see whether this is an option for you.
In a trial that compared massage, acupuncture, and self-care education as treatments for lower back pain, massage was shown to be the most effective treatment for pain and disability. The massage treatment group also used the least amount of pain medication., Spinal manipulation, also known as “spinal manipulative therapy,” is performed by several types of health care providers, including chiropractors and physical therapists. Several studies have shown that spinal manipulation is effective for treating mild to moderate lower-back pain.Always have this and other complementary procedures done by a trained, licensed professional. While spinal manipulation is usually safe when done by a professional, it can cause serious health issues if done incorrectly.
Spinal manipulation is not a good choice if you have nerve pain or damage. Consult with your doctor before starting this type of treatment to ensure it is safe for you., Acupuncture is not a “magic bullet” treatment for back pain. It tends to work best at treating acute lower back pain. Several clinical trials have shown that professional acupuncture is helpful at relieving pain from lower back pain.It is important to note that while several studies show that acupuncture is generally effective at relieving back pain, acupuncture may not be effective at improving function or disability. Acupuncture in conjunction with medication appears to be more effective at reducing pain and improving functionality than either treatment alone.Ask your doctor for a referral to an acupuncture practitioner. It’s important that all of your healthcare providers work together to care for you.The national certification board for acupuncturists in the United States is the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine.Not all health insurance will cover complementary medicine, but insurance is more likely to cover a certified practitioner.

, Cognitive-behavioral therapy, or CBT, identifies negative and unhelpful thoughts and beliefs and replaces them with positive, healthy ones. A CBT approach to treating pain focuses on how you respond to pain symptoms.CBT has been shown by several studies to effectively treat some types of chronic pain, including back pain.CBT can be a good choice when there is no obvious cause of back pain.
Consult your doctor or your insurance company for the names of therapists in your area. Interview a couple of them and ask about their experience in using CBT."

Consult with your physician.,
Get moving.,
Get some aerobic exercise.,
Improve your flexibility.,
Develop your stability.,
Take up tai chi and/or yoga.,
Learn to lift correctly.,
Lose weight.,
Stop smoking.",How to Relieve Back Pain Without Drugs3," Because back pain can have so many different causes, it is important to talk with your doctor before starting any exercise or treatment regimen. This is particularly important if you have suffered a major injury like a fall or a car crash. Some injuries or causes of back pain must be treated with rehabilitation therapy and medication.


It is important to let your regular doctor know about any treatments and steps you are taking to relieve your back pain. This will ensure that your doctor is able to give you the most effective care.

, If your back pain is not the result of a serious injury, returning to normal movement after a few days will help you recover from short-term back pain faster. Unless recommended by your doctor, try to avoid more than 3 days of bed rest.Always consult with your doctor before returning to your normal activities. If you have serious injuries or trauma, trying to “tough it out” could result in re-injury or further trauma.

, Low-impact aerobic exercises, such as swimming, walking, and biking, can relieve chronic back pain.Exercise may aggravate acute back pain, however, so do not begin an exercise regimen immediately. Usually, it is safe to begin an exercise program after 4-8 weeks.Do not put extra pressure or strain on your back muscles immediately. Exercises that can strain your lower back include leg curls on exercise machines, straight-leg sit ups, and toe touches.Gradually strengthen and tone your muscles, and don’t try too much at once.
When possible, work with a professional to create a personalized exercise plan. Your doctor, physical therapist, personal trainer, or exercise physiologist can help you figure out what exercises are right for you., Improving your body’s flexibility may help reduce pain. Stretching exercises and yoga have been shown to reduce back pain and keep it from recurring. Below are a few exercises to try.Lie on your back with your legs together. Bend your knees. Lay your arms to your sides. Roll your knees to one side of your body, keeping your arms at your sides. Hold this position for 20 seconds. Breathe slowly and evenly as you hold and release. Repeat for the other side.
Lie on your back and bend your knees. Take hold of one leg behind your knee. Pull your leg gently toward your chest. Don’t pull it farther than is comfortable. Hold this for 20 seconds, then release. Repeat with the other leg.
Stretch your hip flexors. Kneel on one knee. Raise the same arm straight up (e.g., if you are kneeling on the left knee, raise your left arm). Shift your hips slightly forward. Hold for 20-30 seconds.

, Chronic low back pain can be irritated when your core is not strong enough to properly support your body. Doing some lumbar/core strength and stability exercises will strengthen your core muscles and improve your posture.



Supermans. Lie on your stomach with your arms and legs extended (hence the “superhero” posture). Keeping your hips on the floor, draw your shoulder blades down towards your lower back. Lift your arms and legs off the floor. Hold this for 3-5 seconds, then release. Repeat 10-20 times.

Pelvic tilts. Lie on the floor on your back. Bend your knees and keep your feet flat on the floor. Contract your stomach muscles. You should feel your back press into the floor and your hips rise. Hold this for 10 seconds while breathing evenly, then release. Repeat 8-12 times.Bridging. Lie on the floor on your back. Bend your knees. Keep just your heels on the floor. Pushing your heels into the floor, lift your hips off the floor. You should feel your buttocks contract. Lift your hips until your knees, hips, and shoulders are in a straight line. Hold this for 6 seconds, then release. Repeat 8-12 times.Crunches with an exercise ball. Use a large exercise ball to improve your crunches. Begin by lying on your back on the exercise ball. Slide down until your hips are just off the ball. Plant your feet shoulder-width apart, and keep them flat on the ground. Cross your arms over your chest. Contract your stomach muscles to draw yourself forward. You should feel the crunch in your abdomen, not your shoulders or back. Repeat 10-20 times.

, Tai Chi is a gentle Chinese martial art that combines fluid movement with meditation.. It has been shown by several studies to be effective in relieving lower back pain.Yoga has also been shown to be effective in treating chronic low back pain.It is thought that the combination of mindfulness, meditation, and low-impact physical movement in tai chi and yoga promote pain relief.If you are pregnant, have joint problems, fractures, or hernias, consult your doctor before starting tai chi or yoga., Back pain can be caused by improper lifting technique. Whether you’re working out or just working, be sure you don’t put additional stress on your back by lifting incorrectly.Keep your back straight and bend at your knees. Never bend over at your hips.
Hold the weight or object securely. Do not lift and twist at the same time.
If you’re a fan of squats and similar exercises, make sure you do them with proper form. Poor form in squatting, such as hunching your back or shoulders, can result in pain and injury. Consult a physical therapist or personal trainer to learn proper form, or at least watch videos of correct squatting.If you frequently lift heavy objects at work, use a back brace -- but only in moderation. Wear the brace in 15-minute intervals, or only when you need to lift something heavy. Otherwise, your back muscles may not get the strengthening they need., Being overweight creates additional pressure on the intervertebral disks in your spine.These disks act as “shock absorbers” for the vertebrae in your spine.Americans who are obese are four times more likely to suffer back pain than individuals at a healthy weight.Fortunately, exercising even 20-30 minutes each day can lower your risk of back pain by 32%. Even light exercise is helpful., Smoking is a factor in many health problems, and back pain is no exception. In one recent study, researchers found that people who smoked were much more likely to experience back pain than non-smokers. This finding was consistent across all weight ranges, from healthy weight to obese.Smoking is thought to interfere with your brain circuitry. It is likely that smoking reduces your body’s ability to handle chronic pain. People who smoke are, according to one study, 3 times more likely to suffer from chronic back pain than people who don’t smoke.Good news: stopping smoking reduces your vulnerability to chronic pain, including back pain."

Try short-acting opioids for acute pain.,
Use long-acting opioids for chronic pain.,
Use corticosteroids.,
Consider antidepressants for chronic pain.,
Consider cannabinoids for chronic pain.",How to Reduce Physical Pain with Medication3," Opioids are prescription narcotic pain relievers. They are used for acute pain, generally after surgery. Your physician can also provide opioids to you intravenously in a medical setting.Opioids are generally prescribed for:


Moderate to severe burns
Moderate to severe wounds
Moderate to severe fractures or sprains
Kidney stones
Common opioids include oxycodone, Demerol, hydrocodone, and codeine.
Opioids do not cause stomach bleeding. People rarely get addicted to opioids if they are used for short periods of time to treat acute pain.
Side effects of opioids are nausea, constipation, breathing problems, and drowsiness. If the use of opioids is abused, patients can get abused.

, Long-lasting, slow release opioids can be used in the treatment for chronic pain. This needs to be discussed with your physician, and you should be monitored while taking them. In some cases, patients have formed an addition to these opioids.Examples of long-lasting opioids include morphine, oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and methadone.
Side effects include nausea, vomiting, mental impairment, constipation, and drowsiness. Opioids can be dangerous used with antidepressants, sleeping pills, and antihistamines.
Over a third of people who use opioids for chronic pain management have constipation and must manage that with diet and laxatives.
Taking opioids for an extended amount of time can result in tolerance, dependence, and addiction.
Never stop taking opioids without using a physician-approved weaning method.
The use of opioids for chronic pain not due to cancer is controversial. The controversy is due to the prolonged use, safety, effectiveness, and potential for abuse.Discuss with your doctor whether this option is right for you.

, Corticosteroids are commonly used for bony, visceral, and neuropathic pain. This medication should be used in the lowest dose possible because of the common side effects.

Learn which types of willow trees contain the most salicylic acid.,
Look for a white willow tree first.,
Keep in mind that any willow tree will do.,
Harvest some willow bark.,
Dry the strips if you have time.,
Start a fire.,
Gather some water from a nearby water source.,
Add the willow bark strips to boiling water and simmer.,
Allow the willow bark tea to cool down a bit before drinking.,
Be aware of potential side effects.,
Know when to avoid using willow bark tea.",How to Make Aspirin if You're Lost in the Woods," There are many different types of willow trees and not all of them have high levels of salicylic acid. Salicylic acid is the active pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory component that is used to make aspirin. The types of willow trees with the highest levels of salicylic acid include:Salix alba (White or European Willow)

Salix purpurea (Purple Willow)

Salix nigra (Black or Pussy Willow)

Salix fragilis (Crack Willow);
, Your best bet is to find a white willow tree. White willow trees grow throughout much of the US, Europe and Asia and they are common in forested areas.Features of a white willow tree include:A rough grayish bark
Irregular “furrows”
Smaller branches and twigs that are slender, golden brown and flexible
Leaves that are long and slender (2–4 inches long) with a fine serration at the edges
Tops of the leaves are shiny and green, while the undersides of the leaves are white and silky
Leaves alternate instead of being opposite one another

, All willow trees all contain some amount of salicylic acid in the bark, so it is okay to use a different type of willow tree. For example, if you are by a river, then you can use a river weeping willow.


When in doubt check the leaves to see if they share the features of white willow leaves. Willow tree leaves are distinctive, so checking the leaves may be the best way to identify the tree as a willow.

, Once you find a willow tree, try to find some loose bark and pull it off. As you pull off the bark, make sure that you are getting the papery material that underlies the bark.


It is a good idea to strip the bark from younger branches rather than the trunk. The bark from the trunk is harder to remove and it is also tougher to break up for boiling.

, If you are not in immediate need of the medicine, you should allow the strips to dry out a bit before using them. Lay them on a rock or other dry place in the sun for several hours. If you need the medicine right away, you can skip the drying step.

, The best way to make willow bark tea is to boil the bark in water. To do that, you will need to make a fire. Boiling the water that you will be using for your tea is also the best way to disinfect and purify the water.


You will also need a container to boil the water in, ideally made of metal. If you do not have a container, then you will need to search the area for something made from metal, glass, or clay that you can use to boil water.

, Collect about 3 cups of water and purify it by adding chlorine or ozone. If you don’t have these purifiers, make a fire and boil the water for at least 10 minutes before using.


If you can’t start a fire, let the willow bark soak in the water for at least an hour. Keep in mind that even though wilderness water can be purer in many ways than other water, it does contain various parasites. Boiling water or using a purifier is the best approach to protect yourself from these parasites.
If you are in an area where giardia (a parasite found in water) is present, or may be present, make certain you follow the correct purification procedure. Giardia can cause severe gastrointestinal symptoms that may cause abdominal pain and may also cause you to become severely dehydrated., After the water has started to boil, add the strips of willow bark to the water. Use about one tablespoon of willow bark per cup of water. Allow the willow bark to simmer for five to 10 minutes and then remove it from the fire., After you have finished simmering the willow bark in water, pour the liquid into a cup (if you have one). Let the tea cool down for about 20 minutes so that you will not burn your mouth. After the tea has cooled, drink it slowly.Take the willow bark tea with some food if possible. Salicylic acid has an irritating effect on the stomach.
Be aware that it will take a little while before you feel the effects of the tea, so be prepared to wait a couple of hours after drinking the tea.

, The most common adverse effect of willow bark tea is mild to moderate stomach upset, but there are a few other things that you should be aware of before you decide to drink willow bark tea.Taking too much willow bark can cause nausea, vomiting, and tinnitus, or a ringing in the ears. Drink one cup and wait several hours before taking another dose.
Prolonged use of willow bark tea may cause increased bleeding and slow down blood clotting., Not everyone should use willow bark tea. Consider your age, medical condition, and other factors as well before deciding to use willow bark tea. Do not use willow bark tea if you fall into any of the following categories:Children. Children under the age of 18 should not drink willow bark tea due to the risk of developing a disorder called Reye’s syndrome. This condition causes swelling in the liver and brain.
Pregnant or nursing women. Pregnant and nursing women should not use willow bark tea.
Taking medications. Salicylic acid interacts with several different types of medications, so do not use willow bark tea if you are taking any medications.

Choose a storage location.,
Clean out the space.,
Bring all your medications together.,
Check expiration dates and pare down.,
Create a system to organize medications in the storage area.",How to Organize Your Medications1," If you have lots of medication in your home, there's a good chance you are storing it in several different places. The first thing you should do is find one place to store it all. This allows you to always know where any medication can be found.This could be your bathroom medicine cabinet, or a medicine chest, or some other type of bin. While many people keep pills in a bathroom medicine cabinet, you may want to consider a different room to store your medications in, because the heat and humidity of the shower can negatively affect some medications.In choosing your medication storage location, be mindful of safety concerns. If you have children, or if children visit your home often, you'll want to make sure your medications are stored somewhere that they can't get into.;
, Once you've chosen a place to keep all your medication, empty it completely. If you already have a medicine chest or bin, for example, take everything out.This will make organizing things much easier.


If you already have medications stored in this space, you might sort them into piles based on what they're for as you take them out.This can make it easier to organize them later.

, Get every medication you'll be storing together in one place. This will make it easier to organize them and to see if you have unnecessary duplicates of anything., Before you organize your medications, it's a good idea to make sure you aren't hanging onto expired medications or other medications you no longer need. Check the labels and expiration dates and get rid of any unwanted or unsafe medications.Note that many medications should not be thrown in the garbage because of the possibility of misuse by others. Flushing them down the toilet may create other hazards. Consult the directions that came with the medication or the Food and Drug Administration website for details about how to properly dispose of medication. Often you can take them to your local pharmacy for safe disposal., Once you've collected all your medications in one place and ensured that they are all up to date, your next step is to create a system for organizing them within your chosen space. Choose a method that works well for you. Here are some suggestions:


Organize alphabetically, or by frequency of use.Place medications in plastic bags with cards labeling what's inside each in large font.If multiple people will be storing medication in the space, clearly label which medicines belong to whom using a permanent marker or colored stickers.If using a medicine cabinet, organize by shelf. For example, you could put over-the-counter medications on the top shelf, medications for your heart condition on one shelf, and medications for your migraines on another shelf."
"
Create a list and dosage schedule.,
Get a pill organizer.,
Create reminders.,
Fill the organizer and check reserves routinely.",How to Organize Your Medications2," In addition to organizing all your pill bottles in one space, medications should also be organized for daily consumption on a weekly basis. The first step is to compile a list of all medications you are taking, indicating how many times and when they should be taken each day.This will help you organize your medications and remember which ones to take when. It's a good idea to keep this list with you at all times, in a wallet for example.It's also a good idea to give copies of this list to your primary care doctor and regular pharmacist.Include a physical description of each pill on the list. This will make it easier to organize your weekly pills., A pill organizer is a container with at least one compartment per day of the week.This will help you to quickly and easily determine which pills you are supposed to take each day, and whether you've taken your medication for the day or not.


If you live in a home with more than one person taking medication, you can get different colored pill organizers for each person so that it is clear which one belongs to whom.Make sure to keep your pill organizer out of reach of children, who might take the medication or mix up your pills. Either one is a major safety hazard.Electronic pill organizers are available that dispense pills automatically when it's time to take them. These make it easy to ensure you take your pills at the right time, but may be challenging to program for people who aren't technology savvy., Find a way to remind yourself to take your medications at the correct time. This can be as simple as a note on your mirror or a designated alarm clock or alarm on your phone. Or, you can use one of many apps that give you alerts on your phone when it is time to take medication.


Use the method that works best for you. If you have to take medications several times a day and are comfortable with technology, a phone app or one of the many available electronic medication reminder devices may work best., Pick one day of the week that you always refill your pill organizer.Get in the habit of checking how many doses you have left of each medication at the same time, so you can be sure to refill your prescriptions before you run out.


As a rule of thumb, if you have one week left of your medication after filling up your organizer, it's a good idea to reorder.If you buy your medications online, some online drug stores allow you to set up automatic refill reminders."
"
Use a whiteboard or bulletin board.,
Use a binder.,
Create a spreadsheet.,
Use an app.",How to Organize Your Medications3," Another way to be organized in your medication use is to track your doses to ensure you've taken the right pills each day. There are many ways to do this. One is with a whiteboard or bulletin board.You can post your medication schedule on the bulletin board or whiteboard, and use it to check off each dose you take.
A whiteboard is good for this because you can erase your check marks at the end of the week, or each morning, rather than having to post a new schedule every day or week;however, a whiteboard can also be erased accidentally, resulting in the possibility of missed or extra doses., Another way to track your medication doses and whether or not you've taken them is to put together a three-ring binder with a new page to log each day's doses.Simple medication logs are available online that are formatted to fit a single page. You can just print some out and put them in a binder.An advantage of this method is that it creates a long-term record of your medication doses. You or your doctor can use it to assess your consistency over a long period of time. This can help you determine if your reminders are working or not.

, If you're comfortable with technology, you can also create spreadsheet to track your medication consumption using Microsoft Excel or some similar program.


There are templates available online, or you can just make your own, with a row for each day and a column for each medication., If you are comfortable with cell phone or tablet apps, there are several that will not only remind you to take your medication, but also create a log of whether or not you have taken it.Some of these apps can also provide you with information about the medications themselves, alerting you to possible drug interactions between your medicines. Some of these apps will also remind you when it's time to refill your prescription and can even be used to order a refill."

Bake the cookies.",How to Make Marijuana Cookies," Cannabutter is butter that has been infused with THC from marijuana leaves. It is essential for making marijuana cookies. Making cannabutter is easy, but it is also time consuming and you need a decent amount of marijuana to make it. You will need:2 sticks of unsalted butter
1/2 ounce of marijuana (ground and with seeds/stems removed)
1 cup of water;
, The double boiler will melt the butter and allow the marijuana to steep without using too much heat. If you have a double boiler, then you can use it. If not, then you can just set one up on your own.








To set up a double boiler, place a large stock pot on your stove and fill it about 1/3 of the way full with water. Then, place a medium sized bowl over the stockpot. The bowl should be large enough to overlap the edges of the stock pot, but small enough so that the bottom of the bowl will be in or near the water.
Heating cannabis is necessary to extract the THC and reap the psychoactive effects of the herb.You cannot digest the THC in raw marijuana, so eating raw marijuana would have no effect., Place your two sticks of butter into the bowl of the double boiler and turn the heat on low to medium. The water will heat up and the steam will cause the butter to melt slowly.








Keep the heat low. Do not allow the butter to come to a boil.
The THC in cannabis is fat soluble, not water soluble. This means that it is necessary to heat the cannabis in butter or oil to capture the THC for use in baking.If you do not eat dairy and do not want to use butter, then you could use some non-dairy margarine or coconut oil instead.

, While the butter is melting, you can prepare the marijuana. Place a piece of cheese cloth on a clean surface and fold it in half twice. This will help to ensure that no marijuana escapes the cheese cloth. The place your marijuana on the center of the cheese cloth.








Fold over the shorter edges of the cheese cloth first. Then fold over one of the long edges and roll the marijuana towards the other edge, as if you are rolling a burrito.
Use the cooking twine to tie up the burrito. Make sure that you wrap the string around the burrito evenly and secure it well or it might fall apart.

, Put your marijuana tea bag into the melted butter. You may need to bend it slightly to make it fit into the bowl. You can also use a metal spoon to push it down into the butter a little further.







, Adding water will help to cover all of the marijuana with liquid and it will also help the marijuana to release its THC. Pour one cup of hot water into the bowl with the butter and marijuana tea bag.








Remember that the THC in marijuana is fat soluble, not water soluble. That means that water alone will not extract much of the THC from your marijuana.The water will just help to heat the marijuana so that the THC can be absorbed by the fat in the butter.

, Next, cover the bowl with a heat proof lid and let the marijuana steep in the butter and water for four to six hours. Keep in mind that the longer you steep the marijuana in the butter, the more potent the cannabutter will be.








If you do not want the cannabutter to have too much THC in it, then you might want to stop steeping it at around three to four hours. However, if you want it to be strong, then let it steep for a full six hours.

, When the marijuana is done steeping, the butter will have a green tinge to it.Remove the bowl from the double boiler using oven mitts to protect your hands from the heat. Then, remove the marijuana teabag from the butter with a slotted metal spoon and set it aside.








You may also want to use a second metal spoon to press the marijuana tea bag and squeeze out any excess liquid from the teabag back into the bowl.

, You can leave the marijuana butter in the bowl to cool or transfer it to a different container if you prefer. Let the bowl and marijuana butter cool down to room temperature slowly and then transfer the bowl to the refrigerator.








You can leave the butter in the fridge for a few hours or overnight.If you transfer the liquid to a foil pan, then you can easily drain away the water after it cools.

, After the butter has cooled down to room temperature, it will be back in a solid form. The butter will also have risen to the top of the bowl and the water you added will be at the bottom of the bowl.








Pour out the water and keep the butter. You can use a strainer or just punch a hole in the bottom of your foil pan if you transferred the butter.
The butter is now ready to use to make chocolate chip cookies or as a one to one substitute for regular butter in your favorite cookie recipe. For example, if the recipe calls for ½ cup of butter, then replace the butter with ½ cup of cannabutter.

, Measure out your 1 and 1







, Measure out ½ cup of cannabutter, 2








Make sure that the cannabutter is at room temperature before you start mixing the cannabutter and sugar.

, Next, add 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and the egg to the cannabutter and sugar mixture. Use the hand mixer to combine all of the ingredients together until they create a uniform mixture.







, Measure out 1 and 1







, To complete the dough, you will need to sift in the dry ingredients that you prepared. Add the flour, salt, and baking soda to the wet ingredients. As you add the dry ingredients, use a spatula or spoon to mix the dry and wet ingredients together until a dough forms.







, Line the cookie sheet with parchment paper or spray it with some non-stick cooking spray. Space out the dough balls evenly on the cookie sheet.For large cookies, scoop ¼ cup of dough at a time onto the cookie sheet.
If you want smaller cookies, then try adding one tablespoon at a time onto the cookie sheet.

, For small cookies, bake your cookies at 375 degrees for 10 to 12 minutes.If you want your cookies to be chewier, then cook them for around 10 minutes. If you want them to be crunchier, then cook them for around 12 minutes.








For larger cookies, bake the cookies at 325 degrees for 18 to 25 minutes. Closer to 18 minutes will result in a chewier cookies, while closer to 25 minutes will result in a crunchier cookie.

Look for writing or imprinting.,
Take note of the color.,
Identify the shape and size.,
Use NLM Pillbox.,
Contact the FDA.,
Use a pill identifier through a pharmacy's website.,
Go to Drugs.com.,
Call poison control, if necessary.,
Never take a pill without confirmation from your pharmacist or doctor.,
Check your medicine cabinets.,
Visit a pharmacy.,
Dispose of the pill properly if you cannot identify it.",How to Identify Pills," The first and easiest way to identify a pill is by looking for writing or imprinting on the pill.


Many pills contain small inscriptions that may be numbers, letters, or a combination of the two. These are usually used to identify the pills. If a person uses a pillbox, for example, they can easily tell which pill is which by the inscription if pills are otherwise similar in color, shape, and size.Inscriptions can be hard to read, especially if you are vision impaired. You may have to use reading glasses or a magnifying lens. You can also ask someone else to help you.;
, Pills come in a variety of colors. If there is no inscription, a pill can also be identified by factors like this.


Pills come in a variety of colors, like blues, whites, and tans. Do not just take note of the color, however, but the specific hue or shade. The more specific information you have, the easier it will be to identify the pill., In addition to color, shape and color should be noted.


Pills come in a variety of shapes. They can be round, oblong, kidney-shaped, bow-tie shaped, and more. If you're not familiar with geometry, familiarize yourself with different types of shapes. Hexagons, for example, refer to a shape with six even sizes. Octagons have eight even sides. When talking to a pharmacist or using a pill database, you may need to identify a pill in this way.Also, take note of a pill's size. A pill can be small, large, or medium. You will need to have a rough idea of the pill's size when trying to identify its type., NLM Pillbox is another online resource where you can identify pills based on a variety of factors. It may be slightly more helpful than other online databases as it asks for slightly more criteria.NLM pillbox will ask for the shape, color, and the size. It asks for specific measurements in millimeters, so be sure you have a ruler of some kind.It will, like the other sites, provide you with a catalogue of possible matches with pictures., FDA stands for Food and Drug Administration and is a federal agency that promotes public health by monitoring the production of food, drinks, and medications. The FDA can help you identify unknown pills.


Email the FDA at druginfo@cder.fda.gov with a description of the drug's appearance, including its size, shape, colors, and any markings it has.Someone from the FDA will get back to you as soon as possible with information identifying the drug. They may ask you for more information if the drug cannot be identified based on your initial email.

, Many nationwide pharmacies, such as CVS and Walgreens, have pill identifiers online.


Usually, a database will first ask for any markings the pill has. This is where you would enter the inscription, if any. If there's not an inscription, you will be asked about factors like color, shape, and size.A catalogue of different types of pills will come up when you search, including pictures. You can use this to identify the pill you found.Using a pharmacy you're familiar with can be helpful as you know the pills you're likely to use will be in their database., Drugs.com is a pharmaceutical website that has a feature known as the Pill Wizard which can help you identify pills based on a variety of factors.


Much like a pharmacy website, the Pill Wizard asks you for any imprints as well as the pill's shape and color. After you enter this information and hit ""search,"" a catalogue of potential matches will pop up that includes pictures., If you've ingested a pill and you're not sure what you've taken, call poison control at 1-800-222-1222. They are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If you experience symptoms like shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, or any other unusual health concerns after ingesting a pill call 911., Even if you think you've successfully identified a pill, aways get confirmation from a doctor or pharmacist beforehand to make sure you're safe to take the pill. Even if your identification was correct, the pill may be expired or otherwise tampered with.

, If you cannot identify a pill using an online database, you can go check your own medicine cabinets. Look at the pills you have and see if any of them match the one you found. This is probably the quickest and easiest route to identify a pill if you do not have an internet connection or have no luck identifying the pill online., If your pills do not match any of the pills in your cabinets, go to a pharmacy. A pharmacist should be able to identify the pill for you and tell you whether or not the pill is still safe to take or if it should be thrown out., If you cannot identify the pill, it's best to throw it away. Depending on where you found it, it could potentially be an illegal medication or one that is harmful to you.


Mix the pill in with another substance you're going to throw away, such as cat litter or coffee grounds. Place the mixture in a sealable container and throw it in the garbage.Certain medications are best disposed of by flushing them down the toilet. Find more information on the FDA website here.
There are drug disposal services available through most pharmacies.

Check with your doctor or pharmacist.,
Find a nice small cup, such as a teacup or a tumbler.,
Have a very good pill crusher at hand.,
Buy a safe sweetener like Equal or Sweet-N-Low.,
Get a tiny whisk or spoon, as well as a chopstick, for stirring.,
Once you have your cup with water, add some sweetener to it.,
Stir this well.,
Add the liquid sweetener.",How to Make a Liquid Suspension with Ground Pills," Not all medications will work if they're crushed or put in a suspension; checking whether this approach is effective for the specific pill you're taking is essential.;
, If you use a teacup, use a tough Chinese style. Otherwise use a plastic tumbler.

, Any pill crusher will work and you can ask your pharmacist: they sell pill crushers, sometimes even at the grocery store.

, Sugar is not recommended. Secondly, it is important to also use a liquid sweetener such as blue agave syrup or monk-fruit liquid sweetener. They are easy to get at the grocery store.

, Some people use a battery-powered latte mixer but they are too violent and messy.

, Crush your pills thoroughly and add the crushed medication.

, Don't worry about residue because many medications are not water soluble, which means they won't dissolve in the water. This is why you need to crush the medication thoroughly.

, This gives a better taste but it is more important as a ""binder"" or what the pharmacists call ""the vehicle"". It helps bind the crushed medication in the same way medical syrup works. All you need to do now is stir thoroughly and then take your medicine.

Recognize common varieties.,
Look for information on the pill bottle.,
Find a book or website listing oral steroids.",How to Identify Oral Steroid Pills2," There are several common varieties of oral steroids that you may come across. Recognizing these by name will make it easy to determine if a pill is one of them. Among these are:Cortisone
Hydrocortisone
Deltasone (Prednisone)
Dianabol (Methandrostenolone)
Winstrol (Stanozolol)
Anavar (Oxandrolone)
Anadrol (Oxymetholone)
Turinabol (Chlorodehydromethyltestosterone)

, If you have the bottle the pill came in, it may be significantly easier to determine whether or what type of oral steroid it might be. Simply look for the name of the medication printed on the label.


This information will usually be printed horizontally in black text. Often the name of the drug will be in bold type, at or near the top of the label., Next, enter the name into a search engine, or find a book or reputable website that lists the names of oral steroid pills. Good options include steroidal.com and steroids.org.Look for the name of your pill on the list.


Some pill identification websites will also allow you to enter a name rather than visual identifiers."
"
Call the Center for Poison Control.,
Take a photo and submit it online.,
Take a pill to your doctor or pharmacist.",How to Identify Oral Steroid Pills3," Another way to identify a pill that might be an oral steroid is to call the center for poison control. Their hotline is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.The CPC hotline can be reached at 1-800-222-1222. Call and describe the pill as best as you are able, including information about shape, color, and markings.
Their services are confidential and anonymous.

, There are also websites that allow you to simply send in a photograph of any pill you have found for identification. One such website is http://www.steroidabuse.com.A medical professional will look at the pill you have submitted and will respond as soon as possible via email to let you know what the pill is.
This service is particularly useful for identifying black-market steroids that might not appear in databases of legal or commercially available pills.

, A medical professional such as your doctor or pharmacist should be able to identify pills you have found and let you know whether they might be steroids.


If you have been unable to identify a pill using the methods described above and need to know what it, consult a medical professional."

Exercise regularly.,
Drink plenty of fluids.,
Eat a balanced diet.,
Avoid caffeinated beverages, alcohol, and tobacco.",How to Manage Sleeping Pill Side Effects1," Exercise can help you manage constipation, depression, a lack of attention or focus, and fatigue/drowsiness. Manage these side effects by getting at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise per week. Moderate aerobic exercise includes swimming, brisk walking, and biking.For example, bike for an hour three times a week after work, or take a 30-minute brisk walk four to five times a week during your lunch break.;
, Drinking plenty of fluids, such as water, can help you manage constipation and urinary retention, dry mouth, headaches and dizziness. It is recommended that men drink 13 cups (3 liters) and women drink 9 cups (2.2 liters) of water per day.Sucking on ice chips and chewing on sugarless gum may also alleviate a dry mouth.

, A balanced diet consists of fruits and vegetables, milk and dairy products, healthy meats such as fish and chicken, and healthy starches (potatoes, bread, pasta). Try to stay away from foods that are high in sugar and unhealthy fats.Eating a balanced diet will help your body manage many, if not all, of the side effects associated with sleeping pills.

, Caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco can exacerbate side effects such as dry mouth, headaches, and dizziness. These substances may also worsen your ability to focus and remember things.Never consume alcohol after taking a sleeping pill. Not only will the alcohol disrupt your sleep, it will also increase the sedative effect of the sleeping pill, creating a dangerous and possibly fatal combination.

Be familiar with chemical compounds that are used as inhibitors of the function of the central nervous system.",How to Learn About the Inhibitory Pharmacoligcal Drugs of the Central Nervous System in Humans," This article tries to give an overview about the suspected pharmacological function of inhibitory drugs of the central nervous system in humans. The central nervous system of humans is composed anatomically of the brain and the spinal cord. These two anatomical structures of the nervous system are continuous with each other through the foramen magnum that is an opening in the bones of the skull through which the brain stem passes through and becomes the spinal cord. This part of the nervous system is the target of inhibitory pharmacological drugs that are used to treat psychiatric as well as psychological disorders such as episodes of anxiety and of panic attacks. the normal physiological inhibitory neurotransmitter that is used to treat such psychological conditions is an atypical form of one amino acid that is called gamma-amino-butyric-acid or shortly GABA. This is the normal physiological compound in the body of humans that mediates the physiological inhibition of the function of the central nervous system.;
, Pharmacological drugs that are used to treat anxiety disorders and panic attacks have identical function to this neurotransmitter (GABA). This means that these drugs have inhibitory function on the transmission of sensory stimuli along the anatomical pathways of the central nervous system. the net result of the effect of these drugs is the induction of sedative effect on the person that administers these drugs. most inhibitory drugs of the central nervous system are pharmacological analogues of GABA that are agonists to its physiological function.

, The presumed function of these agonist drugs is through their binding to the natural cellular receptors of GABA within the neurons of the central nervous system that are located either in the spinal cord or within the brain tissue. The manner of pharmacological function of these agonist drugs is possible through several postulated mechanisms. One of them is their effect on the K+ ion channels in the sensory neurons that are responsible for the transmission of the arousing signal. By blocking the K+ ion channel the transmission of the stimulatory electric signal along the neurons of the nervous system is blocked. This is just one of several possible mechanisms for this blocking of the transmission of stimulatory signals along the neurons of the central nervous system.

, The other possible pharmacological effect of this blocking can be performed through the blocking of Cl- ion channels in the cellular membrane of the sensory neurons of the central nervous system.

,, Its entry into the neurons can initiate an action potential within these neurons that can in turn lead to the propagation of sensory stimulatory signals into the central nervous system along its sensory neurons. By blocking the inflow of the Cl- ions into the neuronal cells the initiation of action potential in these cells is blocked and terminated. the clinical manifestations of this pharmacological effect of this type of drugs is the induction of sedative situation in the affected persons that administer these drugs.

, Also other clinical symptoms can include the tendency to initiate a state of sleeplessness due to the depression of the stimulatory cells of this nervous system. This is especially true of the sensory neurons of that are located at various sites along the spinal cord and in the brain. The activation of the autonomic nervous system at its sympathetic part can also induce anxiety states that are similar to those that are observed in the case of activation of the central nervous system. the mechanism of stimulation in both of these systems similar. However it uses different types of signaling molecules or neurotransmitters. also the role of each of these two nervous systems is different in mediating the sensory and motor functions of the various parts of the body.

, The central nervous system is mainly concerned with the brain and spinal cord functions such as mental cognition and memory processing. the autonomic nervous system on the other hand is concerned with the functions of the internal organs of the body that are usually under involuntary form of independent function. The types of neurotransmitters in these two different nervous systems are also different organic compounds. These organic compounds are epinephrine and norepinephrine in the case of the autonomic nervous system. they are both stimulators of the function of this part of the nervous system.

, Inhibitors of the function of this nervous system are usually synthetic pharmacological drugs that are produced in the pharmaceutical industry. The main neurotransmitter of the central nervous system is the GABA molecule or Gamma-Amino-Butyric-Acid. This only known neurotransmitter of the central nervous system is inhibitory in its pharmacological effect on the neurons of this nervous system. excitatory neurotransmitters of this part of the nervous system include synthetic compounds such as amphetamines and the naturally occurring glycine compound which is a typical amino acid that is one of the building blocks of most proteins in the body.

Sleep for at least eight hours to prevent drowsiness.,
Include high-fiber foods in your diet to prevent constipation.,
Alleviate symptoms of depression with vitamin B12 supplements.,
Use eye drops to treat blurred vision.,
Take your medication with milk or food to reduce nausea.,
Take the correct dosage to avoid tolerance.",How to Manage Sleeping Pill Side Effects2," Drowsiness is a common side effect of both over-the-counter and prescription sleeping pills. To manage drowsiness, only take your pills on the nights where you are able to get at least eight hours of sleep.Before taking your pills, make sure to complete your nightly activities and use the restroom. This way, you can prevent having to get up during the night to use the restroom.
Brief naps during the day may also help drowsiness.

, These include foods such as raspberries, apples, pears, artichoke, peas, broccoli, lentils, black beans, whole-wheat pasta, barley, oats, and bran., It is recommended that you get 2.4 micrograms of vitamin B12 daily. Eating foods high in vitamin B12 may alleviate symptoms of depression as well.Foods high in vitamin B12 are beef, turkey, chicken, salmon, trout, clams, prawns, snapper and eggs

, Blurred vision is usually a symptom of dry eyes. You can treat dry eyes with over-the-counter eye drops. If the dryness is severe, then contact your eye doctor to get prescription eye drops.Through an eye exam, your eye doctor can also determine if an underlying eye issue, exacerbated by the sleeping pills, is causing dryness and blurred vision.

, Do this unless directed otherwise. This may help reduce any nausea you may be experiencing. Additionally, try to avoid heavy meals. Instead, eat smaller more frequent meals throughout the day.You can also take an antacid such as Pepto-Bismol to manage nausea.
In general, try to avoid spicy foods if you experience nausea.

, Adhering to the correct dosage prescribed by your doctor or advised on the bottle may help prevent tolerance, dependence, and addiction. This is especially true if you are taking prescription sleeping pills. Also, try to avoid taking prescription sleeping pills every night.You can develop a tolerance in as little as three to four weeks if you take prescription sleeping pills nightly.
Do not take a second dose of medication in the middle of the night.

Track your side effects.,
Contact your doctor.,
Opt for natural remedies.",How to Manage Sleeping Pill Side Effects3," In a journal, write down any side effects you may have experienced after taking your sleeping pills. This way you can manage your side effects more effectively.For example, if drowsiness is a common symptom of yours, then make sure you are getting at least eight hours of sleep on the nights when you take your pills.
If you’re taking prescription medications, discuss your side effects with your doctor at your next appointment.

, You should do this if any of your side effects become severe; for example, if they disrupt your ability to complete day-to-day tasks. Also contact your doctor immediately if you experience suicidal thoughts or actions.Your doctor may decrease your dosage or prescribe a different medication.

, Natural remedies that may help you manage your insomnia are relaxation techniques, abdominal breathing, exercise, and muscle relaxation.By talking to a doctor or therapist, also known as Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), you may be able to determine the underlying cause or causes of your insomnia. By pinpointing the root cause, you may be able to avoid having to take sleeping pills.

In fact, it might be helpful if you keep a journal of when you are having negative thoughts and the results, such as it stopped you from enjoying the moment or from going on an outing., Once your regular doctor checks you out, she will often recommend you see a psychiatrist, since psychiatrists are more qualified to prescribe psychiatric drugs. Therefore, if your doctor doesn't make a recommendation, ask about seeing a psychiatrist., Like you did with your regular doctor, you'll need to describe your symptoms thoroughly. You'll also need to be able to talk about their effect on your life.You need to be comfortable enough to talk freely about your symptoms. If the psychiatrist you see at first is not a good fit, don't be afraid to find another one., You need to approach this topic delicately, since the doctor may become suspicious if she thinks you came in just to get this medication; as noted, Xanax is often abused. However, it doesn't hurt to ask for what you want.


For instance, you could say, ""I've heard Xanax and other drugs like it can help with anxiety. Would that be an option for me?""
Never lead with this question with any doctor. Talk about your problems first, to help establish that you really do need it.

, Another option is to ask for Xanax as a sleep aid in relation to anxiety. Some people take a very small dose before bedtime to help them sleep. Once again, never lead with a request for the prescription. First, describe how you have trouble sleeping due to racing thoughts or anxiety, then move on to asking if Xanax could be a possible solution.

, You may feel like everything is going wrong or is about to go wrong, and you can do nothing to stop it. Alternatively, you may feel a sense of panic about the situations in your life.Some people feel like they are always on edge or that everything in life can lead to something horrible.Some people have panic attacks, which are a sudden onset of fear that can feel overwhelming., Though everyone feels anxious from time to time, anxiety that is persistent and pervasive is a bit more serious. If you have had major anxiety in your life for half a year or more, you should talk to your doctor about it.

, Anxiety doesn't just manifest in psychological ways; you'll also notice physical symptoms. For instance, you may shake, sweat, or breathe too quickly. You may also have a rapid heart beat. In addition, you could feel very tired, or you may not be able to focus on what you need to do.


You could also have symptoms such as stomach problems, dizziness, headaches, or even chest pain.

, If you are just upset by anxiety every once and a while with few side effects, that likely means you don't have an anxiety disorder. However, if your anxiety affects your life everyday, whether by consuming your thoughts or stopping you from doing things, you may have an anxiety disorder.

, Depending on the type of disorder you have, your anxiety can look somewhat different. In addition, what triggers it can vary widely from person to person, or it may have no trigger at all.


Generalized anxiety disorder means you may feel excessive worry about your everyday life, even if nothing bad is happening at the moment.
Panic disorder is when you suddenly have attacks of fear or anxiety that often last for just a few minutes but can last much longer.
Social phobia is essentially a fear of being embarrassed. This embarrassment may keep you from doing certain things or going where you may want to go because you're afraid you'll do something embarrassing.
Focused phobias are a fear of one particular thing or several things; in other words, when you are exposed to your phobia, you have fear or anxiety.

, Xanax is a type of sedative.It belongs in a class of drugs called benzodiazepines, which in turn are grouped under central nervous system depressants.Xanax essentially slows down your nervous system, which is why it's considered a tranquilizer. It does this by binding to receptors in your brain, slowing down your neurons., Most often, Xanax is prescribed for anxiety. You may also have it prescribed for panic disorder,though sometimes doctors are reluctant to prescribe it for this condition, as you often get panic attacks when you are relaxed.Sometimes, it is used a sleep aid in a mild dosage.Xanax can stop or lessen panic attacks.
Xanax can get you through a crisis, such as a stressful exam or difficult meeting. The correct dosage will get your anxiety out of your way so you can focus properly.
It treats the symptoms, not the cause. Xanax is not a cure for an anxiety disorder. Talk with your doctor about what treatments can help you in the long term.

, Xanax can become addictive over time.Therefore, this drug can be abused,and it has been a factor in many overdose cases."

Take your medications as directed.,
Stick to a routine.,

Get some exercise.,
Bathe, dress and groom yourself every day by a given time.,
Monitor your thinking.,

Break down large tasks.Just like you might have to simplify your getting ready routine to smaller, successive steps, it might also be helpful to do this for schoolwork, housework, and other projects.,
Don't pressure yourself to be too social.,
Get some sunshine, even if it is only on your lunch break.,
Remember this is an illness like any other one.,
Don't use supplements without telling your doctor.,
Don't give up hope.",How to Help Pass the Time While You Wait for Your Anti Depressant to Kick In," Medications to treat depression may need to be taken at a certain time every day. It is important to take your medications exactly as your doctor prescribed them, as following the directions may minimize the potential side effects you experience.Never stop taking your medications unless your doctor advises you to do so. Stopping your regimen suddenly will cause your symptoms to return full-force, and you may even experience additional withdrawal symptoms after you have been taking the drugs for a time and then stop.
Be mindful that not taking your meds as directed, or failing to take your meds at all, could lead to you having thoughts about hurting yourself. If you are having suicidal thoughts, immediately call your doctor or a suicide help line. If need be, take yourself to the hospital.;
, It can be terribly difficult to drum up the energy to get out of bed when you are suffering from depression. Creating a morning routine made up of small, successive steps can help you to manage the day more easily and set you off to a good start.Arise at the same time every morning (including weekends). When you wake, perform a few simple tasks, such as sitting up in bed. Then, focus on actually getting out of the bed. Next, do some light stretching. Wash your face and brush your teeth. Eat breakfast and take your meds.
Rather than thinking about getting through the entire day, focus on completing one task at a time.

, Avoid caffeine and alcohol as they both can inhibit the quality and quantity of sleep you get. Read, take a bath, and establish a nightly bedtime ritual. Go to bed at the same time each night.


When you improve your sleep habits, you may wake feeling more refreshed and energized. Lack of sleep can have a significant impact on mood, so establishing healthy sleep patterns can go a long way in improving your depressive symptoms - now and later after the meds kick in., It's a mood brightener. The endorphins released after a good sweat session can naturally lift your mood. What's more, regular exercise gives you confidence, relieves stress, provides a mechanism for healthy coping, and can even help you sleep.As you wait for your symptoms to improve, don't pressure yourself about the intensity or duration of exercise you get - it's not necessary to do anything too strenuous. Just strive to get your body moving in any way possible. Walking, swimming, and yoga are all potentially low-impact activities you can do.

, You'll feel better for it.And the people around you will appreciate it also. Including these tasks in your morning routine can help you to feel more accomplished and motivated for other tasks that await you. If it's all you manage to do, that's okay, too.

, Depressive thinking is overwhelmingly negative. One of the most helpful methods of overcoming depression is learning to change negative thought patterns. This is a major undertaking to do on your own. It is usually most productive when you are guided into changing negative thought patterns with your psychologist or therapist in cognitive behavioral therapy.In the meantime, you can simply focus on becoming more aware of your unhealthy thought patterns.


When you are feeling particularly low or down, look back over your thoughts. What have you been saying to yourself for the past few hours or days? More than likely, these thoughts are negative and contributing to your poor mood.
Aim to identify your negative thinking for a few days. Notice negative thoughts, acknowledge them as being negative and unhelpful to your situation, and release them. Remind yourself that thoughts are just thoughts; they aren't facts or truths.Once you become good at spotting negative thought patterns, you can try to challenge these thoughts. Is what you're saying to yourself logical and realistic? Or, is it exaggerated in some way? Can you think of evidence to refute these negative statements? Try to attack your negative thinking by pointing out how irrational it is, then restate your self-talk to be more realistic.
For example, you might say ""My symptoms will never improve"". If you can note even the smallest improvements in your symptoms, such as you getting better sleep or being able to complete more schoolwork, then you have evidence to refute this claim. Reframe your self-talk with this evidence in mind. A new statement might be: ""It is taking time for my symptoms to improve dramatically, but I do see that my sleep has gotten better and I have been getting more schoolwork done."", Journaling can be a cathartic experience since it allows you to unload your worries, problems, and stressors onto a sheet of paper. In regards to depression, journaling can also help you to problem-solve and track patterns in your symptoms.Write in your journal for a few minutes at the end of your day, including details of what happened, how you felt and what you thought. If you like, you can also take this exercise one step further and consider how you could have handled the day differently by changing your thoughts or reactions to stressful situations.

, Although meditation is heavily acclaimed for its mental health benefits, unless you are already a guru, you may not have the mental discipline to practice right now. Try some easy relaxation exercises to reduce your stress. These may include deep breathing, yoga, massage, listening to soothing music, or taking a long, hot bath., Doing this can help you to ward off additional stress that might worsen your depressive symptoms. It can also help you maintain focus if your depression makes you feel scattered or unfocused.


For example, if you have to write an essay for a college class, you might first focus on compiling research on the given topic. Then, you might outline your essay. Next, you might go ahead and write the parts that are clearly defined in your head - no matter what section of the paper they belong. Then, you can try working on each section of the outline until you have a complete paper. Finally, you might go back and edit the paper. Each step could be completed in a different day (if you have enough time) to make the task more manageable.

, Yes, your family and friends may think it's a good idea for you to attend a big gathering or event, but, it's common to not want to be around others when you are depressed. If your symptoms have yet to let up, you just may not have it in you to socialize. If you do, aim for a low-key event in or near your home, where it won't be too big of a deal if you have to bow out.Strive to be social in small ways each day, like chatting with your mom or best friend on the phone or speaking to your next door neighbor. Even small instances of social connection can lift your spirits.

, It has been found that people deficient in Vitamin D, which is provided through sunlight, frequently suffer from depression.Furthermore, being outside in nature can reduce stress and reduce depressive symptoms. One study found significant improvements when participants engaged in group nature walks.Spend more time outside during the time you are waiting on your meds to work.

, It requires medication. You aren't defective. Your brain chemicals are at an unhealthy level, just like in diabetes when your blood sugar is at an unhealthy level. Like diabetes, there are effective treatments to help you manage this illness., Many people believe St. John's wort to be an effective natural remedy for depression. Unfortunately, this supplement interacts with antidepressants and can lead to an increase in side effects and a potentially life-threatening condition known as serotonin syndrome.Refrain from taking any supplements until you have discussed their possible side effects with your doctor.

, If you find that the antidepressant you are currently taking doesn't work, another one will. You may have to go through several different options before you see a drastic improvement in your symptoms.If you've gone through several meds that have not worked after a good trial, get a second opinion or perhaps more lab work. A fresh set of eyes may find another cause for your depression (e.g., your thyroid quit or you have an auto-immune disease) and put you back to feeling like yourself again.

Your doctor can help you make this decision based on the improvement of symptoms, the length of time you have been on the drug, and your progression in dealing with your depression through other methods.;
, Your doctor will likely have you taper off Paxil by slowly reducing your dosage. If you can, begin this process on a Friday so that you can see how your body is affected without worrying about how to get to work the next day. Other things you may want to consider when planning to get off Paxil:


Take some time off work or plan to taper during a holiday.
Minimize stress — take care of as many chores, bills, or other stressors before you begin. If possible, get help from a friend or family member to manage these things for the duration of your withdrawal.
Inform your friends and family that you are planning to get off Paxil and that you may experience difficult side effects.

, It helps to have an idea laid out detailing how you will deal with your withdrawals. Go ahead and gather things that will distract you, such as movies and television shows, books, music, or games. Think of a physical activity that you can do to help. Try golf, walking, gardening, cycling, or swimming.


Come up with a pleasant idea or memory to focus on during your darkest times. This may help lift your mood and help everything not seem so dire.
Prepare a journal to write through the experience., Abrupt discontinuation of the drug may result in Paxil withdrawal symptoms like anxiety, sleep changes, headaches and dizziness and can last for months. A slow and steady withdrawal under a doctor's supervision can go far in reducing these unpleasant Paxil side effects. Think of your doctor as a partner in the process and follow his directions precisely to make the transition to a medication-free lifestyle as smooth as possible., The standard reduction for getting off Paxil is 10%. To start getting off Paxil, look at your current dosage. Reduce that dosage by 10%. Each time you reduce, reduce by 10% based on the dosage you were just taking.Whatever rate you choose, remember to be conservative so you have the least possible symptoms.


For example, if you take a 20 mg tablet, reducing by 10% is 18 mg. The next time you reduce by 10%, it will be 16.2 mg. You will need a pill cutter and probably a scale to make sure you are getting the correct dosage. You may also decide to switch to liquid Paxil, which is much easier to measure.
Paxil has been found to be potentially harmful to a fetus if taken while pregnant. It is essential you get off Paxil before you become pregnant.If you become Pregnant before tapering off Paxil consult your doctor about how to get off right away.

, A reduction of 10% is the recommended cut. But you need a more individualized rates. This is based on what other medications you are taking, how long you've been on Paxil, and the dosage you take.


If you haven't been taking Paxil long, you may be able to reduce the percentage more quickly. If you have been on Paxil for years, you may have to slow the reduction rate., Possibly the easiest way to taper off Paxil is to take it in a liquid form instead of tablet form. With the liquid, you can more accurately measure the dosage. It comes in a concentration of 10mg/5mL. You will be shown how to measure the correct amount so you can safely taper.Some people believe this is the best way to taper off Paxil.

, Pill cutters can be found at most drug stores. Since you are reducing your dosage, you need to very accurately cut up the Paxil tablet. Cut the tablets into halves or quarters.For example, if you have a 10 mg pill, halves will be 5 mg and quarters will be 2.5 mg.

, If you want to be even more precise, buy a digital scale that measures milligrams. This way, you can cut the pills into smaller sections and weigh the proper dosage., Paxil CR is coated to time-release (the CR stands for ""controlled release"") in your body and if you cut a tablet, your body will receive an unmoderated dose. This can be very dangerous. Instead, switch to regular Paxil. The two tablets release in different ways, and this can start your tapering process., If you have trouble tapering off Paxil, try the Prozac method. Your doctor can replace Paxil with Prozac, which has a longer half life. Switching will help absorb the severe withdrawal symptoms. After you stabilize the Prozac, you can start cutting it in half each week.If you have difficulties, reduce the amount you cut each week. Or you can wait longer between each reduction.
You can also take Prozac in liquid form.

, Pay careful attention to your symptoms and reactions as you taper. The 10% may work just great or it may be a huge drop. You may need to drop it to a 5% reduction per month, or up it to 15-20%. Talk to your doctor about adjusting if you think it is too much too fast or not enough., Psychotherapy can be great for avoiding recurrence of the depression while dealing with Paxil side effects. Counseling and psychotherapy uncover the root causes of the depression so they can be effectively dealt with on a more permanent basis. The other advantage to psychotherapy is that it can be continued over the long run if necessary, without the danger of Paxil side effects from long-term use.

, Self-help support groups can be beneficial as you navigate the withdrawals and accompanying feelings.In addition to support groups, seek out additional support from family and friends that can help keep you on track in your battle against depression. With the proper support from your health care provider and loved ones, you can learn how to get off Paxil and enjoy a medication-free lifestyle once again.

, To help aid you in getting off Paxil and combating withdrawal, adopt a healthy lifestyle. Eat a nutritious diet and get daily exercise to manage Paxil side effects and keep the symptoms of depression at bay. Physical activity releases endorphins, which are the body's natural antidepressant chemicals. Some foods can also positively impact mood without the need for antidepressants to control symptoms.

Tell young kids that their favorite character from a movie or book took medicine to become strong, smart, or fast.;
, Explain why the medicine is a good thing. Look up the details and try to explain them. Pictures might help get the kid interested.


This works best for older children, but it can work for more logical young kids too.

, Show the child what to do by bringing it to your lips and pretending to take it. Say ""yum!"" and smile. This is not all that effective, but it's an easy first step for young kids.


You can pretend to feed a stuffed animal too.
For older children, give yourself a cup of ""medicine"" that's really fruit juice.

, Pick something the child wants, and it will be a strong incentive. Try candy, or a sticker on a reward chart that leads to a bigger prize. For some children, verbal praise can be enough.


Older children might start expecting a reward every time, or demanding more.
You can give hugs and kisses, but don't offer them in advance as a reward. If the child doesn't cooperate and you refuse to hug, this can lead to bad feelings and more stubborn behavior.

, This often leads to power struggles, making the child more stubborn. Use it only after extreme misbehavior, or when the medicine is very important to health. Let the child know that if he does not take the medicine, you will take away a favorite activity or event.

, The colder and sweeter the drink, the more it will hide bad tastes. You can mix liquid medicines directly into the drink. Pills should be taken first, then washed down with the drink.


Check the medication label first for ""contraindicated"" substances. These make the medicine less effective. Grapefruit juice affects many medications, while milk affects some antibiotics.

, Crush the pill and mix it with applesauce or mashed bananas. The child can't complain if he doesn't know it's there! If your child catches on, admit it's there and say you just wanted to make it taste good.


Check the medicine label to make sure it can be eaten with food.

, These drops increase sweetness and suppress some bitter tastes. Let your child choose the flavor.

, This can make bad-tasting liquid medicines much nicer.

, If the medicine is cheap and sold over the counter, buy another bottle from the child's section. There are usually several fruit flavors available.


Some kids like the adult versions, with no added sugar. Make sure you use a child-size dose.
Ask the pharmacist if she has the prescription in flavored form.

, You may need to attempt this when a child is too young to understand why he needs to take medicine. Use this only after trying everything else, and only for important medicine, such as antibiotics.

, Tell the child you will hold him still and give the medicine. Explain why it's so important that you have to do this. Give him one last chance to comply.

, Get another family member to gently hold the child's arms at her sides.

, If you need to, pinch the nose to get the mouth open. Feed the medicine slowly, so the kid doesn't choke.


Use a plastic syringe for young children. Aim it in the cheek to avoid choking.

Picking strains that are easy to grow – If you don't have much of a green thumb, you'll want to pick one of the easy to grow strains like AK-48, Northern Light, Aurora Indica, Jack Herer, Super Lemon Haze;
, The buds in flowers are what contain the active ingredients that produce a high, so getting your plants to flower is vital.Unlike normal cannabis, which requires 24 hours of light to grow and then a 12 hour light cycle to flower, auto-flowering plants flower with 24 hours of light. This means faster flowering and no need to separate growing plants (24 hours of light) and flowering plants (12 hours of light)., Marijuana plants come in female and male varieties, and only female plants produce the buds that yield a high. That means the more females you grow, the higher your yield will be. Luckily, you can purchase feminized seeds to ensure that your crop will be all female.Be aware that under stress, female plants will become hermaphrodites and produce male flowers. You can avoid this by growing your plants in a low stress environment.

Introduce her to each of the doctors and tell her that the doctors are there to help keep her feeling healthy. Keep in close contact with the team, especially soon after being diagnosed, with any concerns, and with any major changes in your child's life. You may want to include:A pediatrician who is knowledgeable about childhood diabetes.
A nurse who specializes in diabetes.
A dietician.
An endocrinologist, a doctor who specializes in hormone problems such as diabetes.
A psychologist. The psychologist can help the child deal with the emotions caused by the diagnosis. Many children go through shock, anger, and denial before accepting the diagnosis.;
, Be sure that he understands what is being done and why. This will make it less scary.If your child is old enough, allow him to practice doing the finger-prick test for measuring blood sugar and injections himself.
If the child is too young to do the finger-prick test alone or give himself injections, you can involve him in the process by asking him to help pinch his skin during injections. This will help prepare him to inject himself when he is older.

, This will help your child understand the relationship between insulin and diet and help her to learn to manage it. Depending on your child’s needs, the doctor may recommend a mixture of different types. Insulin types include:Rapid-acting insulin. Two common ones are insulin lispro (Humalog) and insulin aspart (NovoLog). They take effect in 15 minutes or less and have their maximal effect at about one hour.
Short-acting insulin (Humulin R, Novolin R and others). This usually takes 30 minutes to work and has its greatest effect two to four hours later.
Long-acting insulin. Common ones include insulin glargine (Lantus) and insulin detemir (Levemir). It is effective for 20 to 26 hours.
Intermediate-acting insulin (Humulin N, Novolin N). This takes effect after half an hour and peaks in four to six hours. Children on this type of insulin have to be sure to eat the correct amounts of carbohydrates at the right times because intermediate-acting insulin is prone to causing low blood sugar.

, Being able to discuss and understand the options may help your child take responsibility for his management plan. There are a few options available:Insulin injections. This option involves getting regular shots. The shots can be given with a needle and syringe or with an insulin pen. The pen has a container of insulin inside.
An insulin pump. The pump is about the size of a deck of cards and it is worn on the body. It is attached to a catheter that remains continuously inserted under the skin. The pump is programmed to give insulin, but can be adjusted as needed. A wireless pump that uses small pods filled with insulin is a newer option.

, Low blood sugar, also called hypoglycemia, can occur due to not eating enough, vomiting frequently, getting more exercise, or taking too much insulin. Teach your child to recognize the symptoms and to tell you when her blood sugar may be low. As she learns to recognize the symptoms, she will learn that managing her diabetes will lead to her feeling better. Symptoms include:Shaking
Sweating
Sleepiness
Hunger
Dizziness
Headaches
Bad mood
Altered behavior
Confusion
Agitation
Seizures
Unconsciousness

, High blood sugar is also called hyperglycemia. It can be caused by eating more than usual, eating the wrong kind of food, not taking enough insulin, or being sick. As he starts to recognize the symptoms of high blood sugar, he will understand that taking his medications are important for feeling good. Symptoms include:More frequent urination
Thirst
Dry mouth
Blurry vision
A yeast infection
Exhaustion
Nausea

, This occurs when the body begins to break down fat because it isn’t getting enough energy. You can teach your child to recognize the symptoms and to test for this condition using an over-the-counter kit to test her urine for high ketone levels. Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include:Lack of hunger
Nausea or vomiting
Abdominal discomfort
Dry or flushed skin
Breath that smells sweet or fruity
Confusion
Fatigue
Difficulty breathing or deep or rapid breathing

, As he gets older, he will be responsible for managing his diabetes medication while he is at school. Whether this is giving himself injections or going to the school nurse’s office to be injected, it is important that he understands how his condition will be managed. Things to discuss with the school include:Introducing your child to the school health team. Make sure he knows where the nurse’s office is so that if he feels unwell he can get help.
Talking to your child’s teachers. Your child will need to always have a snack or quick-acting sugar source handy. Make sure the teachers are aware that he might occasionally need to leave class for insulin treatments or to have a snack.
Asking your school how your child should dispose of used needles. If he is injecting himself, he will need to know where to dispose of the needles safely.

, It is not uncommon for young diabetics to develop a needle phobia. It can make the regular insulin injections extremely upsetting for both the parent and the child. Children with needle phobias may try to avoid getting injections or show the following symptoms of anxiety:Dizziness
Dry mouth
Heart palpitations
Sweating
Trembling
Hyperventilating
Fainting
Nausea or vomiting

, There are several ways that this can be done. Your child may want to try different methods to see what helps.You may want to work with a psychologist familiar with the challenges children with diabetes face.


Ask your child to create a fear hierarchy. As your child to make a list of the parts of the injection routine starting with the least frightening to the most frightening. Then start with the easy parts, like holding the syringe or watching someone else inject and have your child do relaxation techniques until the fear subsides. Practice this until your child can work through the whole hierarchy.
Teach your child to use relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, visualizing calming images, or progressively tensing and relaxing different muscle groups in her body.
Try injecting in different places, like a different room of the house or at a relative’s house. This may help remove the cues associated with the anxiety.
Try injecting in different body parts. Many people find it less uncomfortable to inject in the stomach, but other options include the thigh or buttock. This may help if your child experiences soreness due to previous injections.
Help your child find a support group. Your doctor may know of support groups for children with diabetes. You can also contact your local health center or search online with organizations that do diabetes education and outreach, such as Diabetes UK or the American Diabetes Association.

, For teens with diabetes, the usual challenges of adolescence are more complicated. Maintain open communication with your teen and recognize that she may make mistakes. Teens are more likely to reduce compliance with their diet or insulin injections due to rebelling or trying to fit in with their friends.Possible challenges to discuss include:Driving. Talk to your teen about the importance of safety behind the wheel. Teach your teen to check her blood sugar before driving and to always keep non-perishable snacks in the glove compartment. Make sure she understands that it is always better to pull over and treat low blood sugar, even if it means being late. Tell her to be sure not to leave her diabetes supplies in the car because hot or cold temperatures may damage them.Body image. Some diabetics have trouble controlling their weight. If your teen is struggling with this, offer support. Teens are also at risk for eating disorders or skipping insulin in order to lose weight. Your teen may also wish to have confidential support from a counselor or support group as well.Alcohol. Alcohol can alter blood sugar levels. In addition, the awareness changes that occur when people are drunk can be similar to those with low glucose. Make sure your teen understands that alcohol may be particularly dangerous for her."

Take anti-anxiety medication.,
Take antidepressant medications.,
Try Buspirone.,
Use beta blockers or antihistamines for performance anxiety.,
Identify the side effects of the different medications.,
Choose the right medication for you.",How to Get Anxiety Medication2," Anti-anxiety medication is better known as benzodiazepines. These types of medication are considered tranquilizers because they help slow down the brain and body. They work quickly and can be taken during an anxiety attack.Common anti-anxiety meds include Xanax, Klonopin, Valium, or Ativan.
Anti-anxiety medication can lead to dependence when taken for longer than four months.
This type of medication can interact negatively with alcohol, painkillers, and sleeping pills.
High risk individuals for taking anxiety medication include people over 65, pregnant women, and those with a history of substance abuse.
Stopping taking anxiety medication suddenly may cause withdrawal. This may include increased anxiety, insomnia, shaking, rapid heartbeat, sweating, and disorientation.

, Common antidepressant medications are used to treat anxiety. Antidepressants have a lower risk for dependence and substance abuse. When using antidepressants, it may take over a month to feel the effects.Common antidepressants used for anxiety include Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Lexapro, and Celexa.
Stopping taking antidepressants can cause severe depression, fatigue, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, and flu-like symptoms.

, Buspirone is a newer mild tranquilizer used as anti-anxiety medication. This medicine acts slower than other anxiety medication. The effects may take around two weeks to start working.Buspirone doesn’t have the same side effects as other anxiety medications. It doesn’t lead to dependence as easily, there are only minor withdrawal symptoms, and it doesn’t impair cognitive function as badly.
Buspirone has been shown to be most effective with generalized anxiety disorder.
This may be a good option for people over 65 of those with a history of substance abuse.

, Beta blockers and antihistamines are sometimes used to help with anxiety. They are mostly used in connection with norepinephrine and the fight-or-flight response. Beta blockers and antihistamines can help relieve physical symptoms connected with anxiety but does nothing for the emotional symptoms.These medications can help with things like shaking, dizziness, and pounding heart.
They may be helpful if you have phobias or performance anxiety.

, Each of the different types of medications used to treat anxiety have side effects. These side effects can vary from minor to severe. Before choosing a medication, weigh the side effects next to the benefits to make the right choice for you.Anti-anxiety medication can cause drowsiness, slow reflexes, slurred speech, disorientation, depression, dizziness, impaired thinking, memory loss, upset stomach, and blurred vision. Some people may experience the opposite of the calming effects, experiencing mania, rage, aggression, impulsive behavior, or hallucinations.
Antidepressants may cause nausea, weight gain, drowsiness, headaches, nervousness, decreased libido, upset stomach, and dizziness.
Buspirone can cause stomach problems, such as nausea, constipation, or diarrhea, headaches, drowsiness, dry mouth, and dizziness.
Beta blockers can cause abnormally slow pulse, nausea, light-headedness, and sleepiness.

, Each anxiety medication has characteristics that may influence your choice. You should think about whether you need immediate relief for a phobia or anxiety/panic attack, or whether you need something longer lasting. You should also think about whether you fit into a risk group for a particular medication, if you have medication or lifestyle choices that interfere with the meds, or if dependence is a concern.


If you need immediate help for panic or anxiety attacks, anti-anxiety medication like Xanax, Klonopin, Valium, or Ativan may be right for you.
If you want a medication for longer management, try antidepressants.
Beta blockers and antihistamines may be a good choice if you have a very specific phobia.
If you have a history of substance abuse, antidepressants or Buspirone may work well. These two may also work well if you are over 65.

Determine if a non-medication treatment is better.,
Know that medication is not a cure.,
Be patient.",How to Get Anxiety Medication3," Medication can help manage symptoms during bad times. However, before you take medication, you should explore other treatment options. Many doctors and mental health professionals believe that non-medication treatments are more effective than medicine.Non-medication treatment options include therapy, behavior therapy, relaxation and breathing techniques, cognitive therapy, diet and exercise, and working on assertiveness and self-esteem.
These other types of treatments can help you address the underlying reasons for your anxiety and the emotional and psychological symptoms. They can also help you learn skills to manage your anxiety in your daily life.

, Medication can help alleviate the symptoms of anxiety. However, no anxiety medication will cure you of your anxiety. Treating and curing your anxiety includes a variety of different approaches. Medications should provide short-time help while you work through issues. For some, medication can help in the long-term with chronic disorders.Discuss with your doctor before you take medication what other treatments are available for long-term management and treatment for your specific anxiety disorder.

, Finding the right treatment and medication combination for you may take some time. The first medicine you try may not the right for you, so your doctor may have to change your meds a few times before you find the right fit. Just remember to be patient as you and your doctor find the right treatment for you.Your doctor may suggest alternatives to medication. Consider trying other forms of treatment in place of or alongside the medication.
Make sure to follow up with your doctor and discuss any changes, symptoms, or side effects you are experiencing.

They keep light out, offer easy hookups for your grow lights, are waterproof, and provide an exhaust point. Many are sold with lights, exhaust system, and hydroponic system included, making them great for beginners.


See http://howtogrowmarijuana.com/grow-box for a review of grow boxes.
Check out http://howtogrowmarijuana.com/grow-tent for a review of grow tents.

, If you are going to devote an entire room to your crop, you'll want to clear it out. Marijuana plants need a warm, humid environment, so to prevent the growth of mold or pests, you'll want to remove all chairs, curtains, carpets, clothes, and other surfaces that could host mold.You'll need an electrical outlet for your grow lights, as well as easy access to water.
Marijuana grows best between 72 and 77 degrees. Try to choose a room where it is easy to maintain this temperature. Too many windows can make a room too hot, while a basement might require continual heating.
A tile or concrete floor will make for easier cleanup of spilled soil or water.

, Your plants need total darkness in their dark period. Otherwise, they may become stressed and become a hermaphrodite – i.e. grow male flowers that contain no THC and thus reduce your yield. Cover the windows and seal any light leaks with opaque reflective tape., The more light your plants get, the better they will grow. Reflected light from your walls and ceiling can greatly speed up grow time. To make your walls reflective, consider using:Mylar – Aluminized mylar is expensive, but it reflects up to 97% of the light that hits it. Hang it flat against the wall and keep it clean.
Flat white paint – It's cheap, easy to clean, and reflects up to 85% of the light that hits it.
Emergency blankets – You can buy them at camping stores. They only reflect 70% of light, but they're inexpensive and good for small spaces like cabinets or closets.
Aluminum foil – Don't use it! It reflects light poorly, is hard to keep flat, and creates a fire hazard.

, To grow, your plants will need light provided by bulbs that provide a full spectrum of light (unlike normal household bulbs). You have several choices, but broadly speaking, high pressure sodium (HPS) or metal halide (ML) lights will cost less to set-up but more to run, while LED lights will cost you more up front, but save money in the long-run.CFL – Compact fluorescent lights may be used for starts and seedlings, but generally do not produce enough light for the vegetation or flowering phase.
HPS – High pressure sodium lights produce lots of light in the orange spectrum, making them best to use to induce flowering. A good rule of thumb when deciding how many lights to get is that you will need 50w per square foot of growing area.
ML – Metal halide lights produce a lot of light in the blue spectrum, making them ideal for use during the plant's vegetation phase, as they will keep your plant short and bushy. Again, you will need about 50w per square foot.
LED – Full spectrum LED lights are much more energy efficient and do not get hot, so you can mount them closer to your plants and won't need fans to remove heat. You can also use one set of lights for both the vegetation and flowering phase. Follow the recommendations of the manufacturer for how many lights you'll need for your growing footprint.

, You'll need a hood that directs and focuses light on your crop. While LED lights can plug directly into the wall, the hoods that hold HPS and ML bulbs cannot, so you'll also need a ballast for these bulbs, which converts the electricity from yoru wall into a current appropriate for the lights.


HPS and ML bulbs – They are very hot, so consider getting a cooled hood that allows for a ventilation hook up that draws heat away. For a quick guide to how far from your plants they should be, see http://www.growweedeasy.com/hps-grow-lights-setup.
LED – These lights usually come with a built-in fan for cooling.

, If you plant auto-flowering seeds, you won't need to worry about turning the lights on and off. Otherwise, you'll need to turn the lights off twelve hours a day to initiate flowering. An electrical timer will do this for you in case you forget or are away from your plants., You need to keep air circulating in your grow room or grow tent in order to draw heat away from your crop, to ensure the plants get enough CO2, to control humidity, and to neutralize the odor of the plants. Without a ventilation system, you'll have smaller yields and risk losing your plants to diseases brought on by excessive heat and humidity.Oscillating fan – Use an oscillating fan to circulate air so as to avoid hot spots and to create a breeze that will improve growth by helping with transpiration.
Carbon filter – Attaching a carbon filter to your exhaust fan will remove odors that might aggravate your neighbors.
Exhaust fan – You'll want a fan with a high enough CFM rating (cubic feet exhausted per minute) to replace all the air in your grow room or tent every 1-3 minutes.

Determine the cubic area of your space (length x width x height).
Take into account efficiency. If the exhaust travels a straight, short path, multiply your area by 2. If the path is long or twisting, multiply by 3.
Pick a fan with a CFM higher than the number you calculated, particularly if you are going to attach a filter.


Air intake – You'll need a way for new air to enter your tent or room as the old air is blown out. A simple hole (in the tent or a door or window) will do, so long as it is 3-4 times bigger than the exhaust hole. If the intake hole is smaller, you'll want to use an intake fan to avoid putting to much stress on the exhaust fan.

, Your plants will grow best in certain temperature, humidity, and pH ranges. Installing a thermometer, humidity meter, and pH meter in your system will help you perfect the growing environment.

, You can use tap water for your plants, but you'll want to make sure its pH is between 5.8 and 7.0, and it doesn't carry too many minerals.


Letting water sit for 24 hours will help bring its pH closer to 7.
Raise water's pH by adding lime, wood ash, or a pre-mixed solution (available at most garden centers).Lower water's pH by adding sulfur, phosphoric acid, or a pH-lowering solution.If you live in a hard water area (meaning your tap water has a high mineral content), you will want to filter your water. Consult the water hardness map at http://www.qualitywatertreatment.com/city_water_guide.htm.

Plant your seedlings in potting soil.,
Purchase and prepare your soil.,
Care for your plants during the vegetative stage.,
Transfer your plants to larger pots as needed.,
Induce flowering.,
Remove any male flowers.,
Adjust the growing conditions for flowering.",How to Grow Medical Marijuana3," While you can grow more marijuana outdoors or achieve higher yields indoors with hydroponics (growing plants without soil), growing indoors with soil offers a winning mix of ease and security that makes it a good choice for beginning growers who only need enough medical marijuana for themselves., Germinating is simply the process by which you start your seeds sprouting. You can germinate them in a variety of ways – the key is to keep them warm and moist.Starter cubes – These cubes of growing medium are the easiest option. Stick your seed in the hole, pointed end down, and keep the cube moist and warm. Once the seedling appears, you can plant the cube directly in potting soil. Good brands include Jiffy Pellets and Rapid Rooters.
Wet paper towel – Put the seeds in the paper towel, fold it and put it in a dark place for 1 to 3 days. When a white root pops out, plant 1 inch deep with root downward.
Warm water – For older or dried out seeds, try dropping them in a glass of slightly warm water and placing it in a dark place. They should sprout in 24-32 hours. If they haven't after this time, move them to a moist place to finish sprouting.
Germinate in soil – You can germinate your seedling directly in potting soil. Plant 1 inch deep with the pointy end down, and keep the soil moist and warm.

, Seedlings carry their own nutrients, so don't start them out in overly-nutrient rich soil. For best results, plant seedling in potting soil contained in plastic cups with holes poked in the bottom for water drainage.You can transfer to a larger pot and begin slowly adding nutrients after two to four weeks.

, You can buy a soil mix like Fox Farms designed for marijuana, or purchase garden soil and add the necessary nutrients. You can also use coco peat (coconut shell hair), which retains moisture and drains well, and has the correct pH. If using garden soil, consider:pH – Marijuana needs soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7. For overly acidic soil, use 1 cup of dolomite lime for every ¼ liter of soil to increase pH. To increase acidity, add coffee grounds or citrus peelings.
Texture – Moist soil should barely stay together when run through your hand, and feel spongy when you clench it in your fist. If the soil is too dry, you can add vermiculite to increase water retention, but be sure to adjust pH afterwards. Perlite will increase drainage and will not impact pH.
Nutrients – As well as inorganic fertilizers, there are a variety of organic materials you can add to your soil to increase the phosphorous and nitrogen content, including guano (nitrogen and phosphorous), worm castings (nitrogen), kelp meal (potassium and nitrogen), and bone meal (phosphorous).

, During this stage, your plants do nothing but grow. The vegetative stage lasts 4-5 weeks before flowering can start, but can go longer if you want bigger plants.To keep your plants healthy, you'll need to make sure their environment is ideal:Water – Poke your finger in the soil – if it is dry up to your first knuckle, add water. Water until 10-20% of the water you added has drained out the bottom of the pot.
Light – You need to provide at least 18 hours of light a day to keep your plants in the vegetative state. 24 hours of light will not harm the plants, but you can save energy by giving 18 hours of light and 6 hours of dark.
Nutrients – Add the nutrients to the water you use to water the plants. Start by adding half the amount recommended on the packaging. As your plant gets bigger, you can add more nutrients.
pH – The ideal pH is between 6 and 7. Add 1 cup of dolomite lime for every ¼ liter of soil to increase pH. To increase acidity, add coffee grounds or citrus peelings.
Temperature – Keep the temperature between 70 and 85 degrees. 70-75 degrees is best for most plants. If you have a CO2 generator, you can raise the temperature to 80 degrees.Humidity – Keep relative humidity at 70-80% during the seedling phase and 50-80% during the vegetative phase. Increase it with a humidifier. Lower it with a dehumidifier or by increasing the rate of your exhaust fan., If your plant becomes too big for its pot, its growth will slow. To transfer, invert the plant in its pot while holding your hand over the soil around the plant's base. Let the plant and its soil fall into your hand, and gently place it into a hole dug in the soil of the new pot. The size of the pot needed depends on how high you want the plant to be:12"" = 2-3 gallon container
24"" = 3-5 gallon container
36"" = 5-7 gallon container
48"" = 6-10 gallon container
60"" = 8-10+ gallon container

, You can keep your plant in the vegetative stage as long as you want, but a good rule of thumb is to end the vegetative stage when it is half the final height you desire, as plants generally double in height while flowering. Switch the light schedule to 12 hours on, 12 hours off to induce flowering.

, Even if you have all female seeds, plants may still produce a few male flowers if stressed. You'll want to remove them immediately to prevent pollination, because seedy buds are less potent.A male flower has pollen sacks (little balls) around where the main stem connects to the branches.
A female flower has white hairs at that spot.

, Your plant has different requirements during the flowering stage. For the best buds and highest yields:Light – During the 12 hours of light, give as much light as possible to the bud sites. Tuck leaves to the side to expose them.
Nutrients – Switch to a formula lower in nitrogen and higher in phosphorus, as too much nitrogen can limit bud growth. After 4 weeks, you'll want to start steadily reducing the amount of nutrients you provide. Provide no nutrients in the last 2 weeks to avoid any chemical taste to your buds.
Humidity – Lower it to 40-50% to reduce the risk of disease."

Ask whether it is safe to continue using your current medication.,
Ask about scientific research indicating safety during pregnancy for any antianxiety medication you are prescribed.,
Some evidence suggests that the risk of birth defects increases with the duration and dosage of the drug used, so ask for the lowest effective dose if medication is deemed necessary after a consultation with a health professional.,
Discuss the safety of antianxiety prescriptions with your pharmacist.,
Be alert for any side effects of antianxiety medications during pregnancy.,
Ask about reducing your dosage or weaning yourself off of antianxiety medication, if possible.,
Ask about professional talk therapy.",How to Find Safe Antianxiety Medication While Pregnant1," Many antianxiety medications are not recommended for use during the first trimester of pregnancy due to their ability to cross the placenta to the fetus, potentially causing birth defects, developmental delays, or drug dependency.


Benzodiazepines (BZDs), tricyclic antidepressants, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and certain other antidepressant or antianxiety medications can cause birth defects or complications when used during pregnancy and should be avoided when possible.;
, Although additional research is necessary, the lowest useful dose of many Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and many antidepressants can often effectively treat anxiety during pregnancy without considerable increases in the risk of birth defects or postpartum infant complications.

,


If possible, SSRI use should be reduced or restricted in the third trimester to prevent problems with dependency and low activity levels in the newborn.
If you have a serious psychological condition, most health professionals will recommend continued pharmaceutical treatment despite a potential risk to the baby. Pregnancy outcomes tend to be worse for women with severe conditions who discontinue medication during pregnancy.

, Inform the pharmacist of your pregnancy and ask about the safety of your prescribed antianxiety medication.


Pharmacists often have excellent knowledge about drug contraindications and research for safe prescription drug use.
Ask for information about side effects that could cause problems for the baby (such as changes in blood pressure) or that indicate a need to discontinue use.
Also ask about potential interactions of your antianxiety medication with food, beverages, and other medications to prevent dangerous complications.

, The hormonal changes caused by pregnancy can impact the pharmokinetics of antianxiety medications, altering the way they work in your system.


If the medication causes vision changes, difficulty breathing, dizziness, significant stomach upset, or other worrisome symptoms, consult a health professional immediately and ask about changing medications or dosages.

, If you are concerned about the potential effect of antianxiety medication on your developing baby or if the antianxiety medications that are safe for pregnant women are not helping your symptoms, you may be able to reduce or discontinue the use of medication just for the duration of your pregnancy.


In some cases, pregnant women can reduce the dosage of antianxiety medication without experiencing noticeable increases in anxiety-related symptoms.
Some women may also be able to gradually discontinue the use of antianxiety medication during pregnancy or breastfeeding by scaling back on dosage over time (to prevent withdrawal symptoms).
Always work with a physician to safely discontinue or reduce medication, as some antianxiety medications create dependency.

, Many women can successfully manage anxiety with counseling and talk therapy sessions during pregnancy. Support groups and regular counseling sessions can teach women with certain anxiety disorders strategies for managing symptoms without pharmaceuticals. These may not be able to replace medication therapy for women with severe anxiety disorders.

Use hydroponics to achieve higher yields indoors.,
Choose your hydroponic system.,
Germinate your seeds.,
Fill your system with nutrient solution.,
Care for your plants during the vegetative stage.,
Induce flowering.,
Snip off any male flowers.,
Change your care regimen during flowering.",How to Grow Medical Marijuana4," Hydroponics means growing plants without soil. Water-soluble fertilizer is used instead. It can produce bigger yields in a shorter period of time, but is more expensive, harder to set up, and requires more careful maintenance. It is ideal for people who are going into the business of growing medical marijuana for sale. That said, hydroponics kits can be purchased that make this an attractive option even for beginners growing their own supply., There are active systems, which use mechanical devices to deliver nutrients to the plants, and the passive wick systems. While active systems can produce higher yields faster, they are also more expensive, more delicate, and require more maintenance.Passive Wick System – The plant sits in a well-draining substrate above a nutrient solution, and nutrients are constantly drawn up into the substrate through a wick. Substrates: vermiculate, peat moss, coco peat.
Ebb and Flow – A nutrient reservoir periodically floods the containers where your plants are growing. The solution then slowly drains back into the reservoir. Substrates: rockwool or coco peat.
Top Feed/Drip Feed – Emitters drip nutrients directly into the soil near the roots. Excess nutrients then drain back down into the nutrient reservoir. Substrates: hydroton clay pebbles, coco peat, or rockwool.
Nutrient Film – Multiple plants are placed in a tilted tray, with nutrients constantly flowing down the slope past their roots, then being pumped back to flow past again. An effective system, but best for experience growers as it requires a lot of fine-tuning. Substrates: rockwool or coco peat.
Deep Water Culture – The roots grow in a constantly oxygenated nutrient solution. It is a low maintenance system, but a loss of power or incorrect nutrient levels can kill your plants. Substrates: rockwool or hydroton clay pebbles.
Aeroponics – The plant roots are held in a dark, sealed box where small nozzles emit a mist of nutrients over them, providing a humid, oxygenated area for the roots. This is the most effective system for growing marijuana, but is also very expensive. Also, if the power cuts out, the mist stops and your plants die. Substrate: hydroton clay.

, The easiest way to do this is to germinate (sprout) your seeds in a bit of rockwool. Keep it warm, wet, and in a dark place. Once sprouted, you can transfer the rockwool directly to your substrate.For older or dried out seeds, try germinating them in warm water in a dark room. If they have not sprouted after 32 hours, move them to a substrate to continue germinating.

, Do not mix nutrient solution inside your system. Instead, fill a bucket with water (pH 6-7, filtered if hard) and add the appropriate amount of nutrient solution to it. Adjust the pH after the solution is mixed; it should be between 5.8 and 6.2., The vegetative stage lasts as long as you want your plants to keep getting bigger. Once you have transferred your seedlings to you hydroponic system, you'll need to maintain the system, as well as the lighting and temperature in the growing environment.


Light – Your plants should receive at least 18 hours of light a day to keep them in the vegetative stage. 24 hours of light will not harm them.
Temperature – Keep it between 72 and 77 degrees.Humidity – Keep it at 50-80%.Nutrient mix – It should be changed at least every two weeks, or when the reservoir has dried. Mix the new solution in a bucket. Quickly throw out the old solution, clean the reservoir and pumps with hot water, and add the new solution.Cleaning – Clean your system once a week. Scoop up any plant material, flush all pots to remove roots, and wash tools in the dishwasher., The flowers of female marijuana plants are what produce the buds with active ingredients. Your plant will be capable of flowering after 4-5 weeks of growth. Plants typically double in height after flowering begins, so you'll want to induce it when they are half as tall as the final height you are aiming for. To induce flowering, change the light cycle to 12 hours light, 12 hours dark.

, Female marijuana plants can become hermaphroditic if stressed due to too much light during dark periods, lack of nutrients, low temperatures, low CO2, or other reasons. They will then produce male flowers. You'll want to remove them immediately to prevent pollination and the resulting seedy buds.A male flower has pollen sacks (little balls) around where the main stem connects to the branches.
A female flower has white hairs at that spot.

, Flowering plants have different nutrient requirements, and are also more prone to disease. To maximize your yield:


Nutrient mix – Switch to a low nitrogen, high phosphorus formula. A Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium mix of 5-50-17 is ideal, though 15-30-15 will work. Use nothing but clean water the last two weeks of flowering to flush out any chemical taste.Humidity – Lower it to 40-50% to reduce the risk of disease.Light – Tuck leaves out of the way of the buds so they get plenty of light.

Grow outdoors for less expensive, larger crops.,
Choose where your planting location.,
Choose strains that flourish outdoors.,
Prepare your site for planting.,
Plant in April or May, after the last frost.,
Germinate your plants.,
Give your seedlings plenty of light.,
Transfer seedlings to your growing site.,
Care for your plants as they grow.,
Sex your flowering plants.",How to Grow Medical Marijuana5," Growing your crop outdoors allows you to save on the cost of setting up your grow room and electricity for lighting. Your plants can also get much larger due to more sun and CO2, yielding a big harvest. And it's also relatively easy. The downsides are security worries and the potential for bad weather to ruin your crop. Still, if you have a secure place to grow your crop, this is a good option., When selecting a spot for your crop, you'll want to consider space, protection, sun exposure, water, and soil.Space – Remember, you don't need a lot of square feet to grow a big crop, since outdoor plants will get much taller than indoor ones.
Protection – You must protect your crop from three things: people (angry neighbors or thieves); wind; and animals like rabbits and deer. Take advantage of natural features like hills, or screen off your crop.
Sun exposure – The more sun your plants get, the better. Look for a southern exposure. Watch out for buildings, bushes, or trees that might cast shade over your garden.
Water – Marijuana plants need lots of water. If it doesn't rain a lot where you live, make sure your garden is within easy reach of a stream or a hose.
Soil – Good soil is compact when squeeze but breaks apart again with little pressure. It should drain well, so avoid places with standing water. pH should be between 5.8 and 6.5. If grasses or weeds are already flourishing there, then it's a good site.

, If you live in a warm, sunny place that doesn't experience frosts, then you can use outdoor or indoor strains. If you live further north, you'll want to use hardier strains that grow well outdoors.Check howtogrowmarijuna.com or grow-marijuana.com for a complete guide to outdoor strains.


Warm climates with no frosts (like southern California) – Choose any seed you want.
Sunny climates with occasional frosts (like the Mediterranean or southern US) – Most indicas and some hybridized sativas, like Silver Haze #9.
Colder, damper climates (like northern Europe or the northern US) – You'll have best luck with strains specifically designed for such climates, like Sensi Star or Holland's Hope. Also consider autoflowering strains like Auto Frisian Dew or Snow Ryder, which do well in colder climates.

, You'll need to improve the soil, clear the site, and dig holes for your plants.Soil - If you are not blessed with soil that has the correct pH and drains well, you'll want to improve it for higher yields. For clay soil, add compost and manure or perlite to improve drainage. For sandy soil, add compost and mulch or vermiculite to increase water retention.You can also plant your crop in a container if the soil is very bad.
Clearing – Pull up all grasses and weeds. You don't want them competing with your crop.
Holes – You can simply plant your seeds a half inch deep in the soil, but for better results, you'll want to prepare holes with good drainage. Dig a hole about 2 feet deep and 2 feet in diameter. Line the base with gravel and fill it in with prepared soil.

, In warmer climates, you can plant in April. In colder climates, it's best to start your plants indoors, then transfer them outdoors in May after the last frost. Starting them indoors will give them extra growing time to ensure they flower before the first frost of fall., Germinating simply means sprouting. If you want to plant your seeds directly at your site, put them a half inch under the soil. Be warned though that young cannabis plants are delicate and frequently fall prey to snails and insects.Accordingly, most people germinate their seeds, plant them indoors and don't move them out until they are 3-4 weeks old. There are several ways to germinate:


Starter cubes – The easiest method. Stick your seed in a cube of growing medium like a Jiffy Pellet or Rapid Rooter. Once the seedling appears, you can plant it directly in potting soil.
Damp paper towel – Fold a damp paper towel over the seeds and put them in a dark place for 1 to 3 days. When the root pops out, plant the seed 1 inch deep with the root downward.Warm water – For older or dried out seeds, try dropping them in a glass of slightly warm water and placing it in a dark place. They should sprout in 24-32 hours. If they haven't after this time, move them to a moist place to finish sprouting.

, If starting your seedlings off indoors, you'll need to make sure they have plenty of light. You can put them on the windowsill or in a room with lots of light, or use artificial lights (see Setting up a Growing Room above).

, If you have decided to start your seedlings off indoors, you'll want to transfer them to the growing site after 3-4 weeks. Carry the potted plants to the site and turn them upside down to remove them from the pots. Plant them – soil, roots, and all – in the holes you have dug. Water after planting.

, During the vegetative and flowering stage, your plants will need water and nutrients.


Water – If it rains 1 inch a week, you don't need to add water. Otherwise, you'll want to water your plants every other day. Try to use pH 7 water.
Weeding – Remove any weeds growing around your crop.
Vegetative nutrients – Give your plants nitrogen rich nutrients during the vegetative stage. You'll want a nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium ratio of around 10-5-7.Flowering nutrients – Switch to a phosphorus-rich formula with a ratio between of 5-50-17 and 5-10-7. For the last two weeks of flowering, stop giving nutrients to avoid a chemical taste. Water with plain water to flush out chemicals from your plants.

, As soon as your plants start to flower, you'll want to sex them (i.e. determine which ones are male and female), so that you can remove the male plants. Otherwise, you'll end up with seeds in your buds, which reduces their potency.Male flowers – Male pre-flowers have small bumps where the main stem connects to the flower. In developed flowers, these bumps become little balls (pollen sacs).
Female flowers – Pre-flowers have white hairs protruding. Developed flowers will have a thicker concentration of hairs.

Remain calm.",How to Handle Prozac Withdrawal," If you've decided that you don't want to take Prozac anymore, it's important to have a conversation with your doctor about your options. Don't be afraid to ask about what Prozac withdrawal will be like and how to prevent it.If you want to stop Prozac because of side effects, your doctor may want to switch you to another medication.
If you can't afford your prescription or your doctor does not want to keep prescribing it for you, have a conversation about the best way to stop taking Prozac. You may also want to ask about any nonprofit organizations that may be able to help you pay for your medications.
Keep in mind that you have to take antidepressants for at least six months to see an effect.;
, The single best thing you can do to prevent withdrawal symptoms when you stop taking Prozac is to reduce your dosage very slowly over the course of several weeks or even months. Talk to your doctor to determine the right schedule for you. It will depend on a variety of factors, including your current dose and how long you have been taking Prozac.If you start experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms, call your doctor right away. He or she may recommend that you revert to a higher dose and taper off more slowly.
The more slowly you taper your dosage, the less likely you are to experience withdrawal symptoms at all.

, In order to psychologically prepare yourself for withdrawal, take a moment to think about why you want to stop taking Prozac. Come up with a specific goal if you can, and consider writing it down to help keep yourself motivated and committed.If you do start experiencing withdrawal symptoms, it's important to remind yourself that they are only temporary and that it is necessary to endure them in order to reach your goal.
You may find it helpful to keep a journal during the withdrawal process so you can go back and look at your progress.

, You will have a much easier time dealing with the symptoms of Prozac withdrawal if you have at least one person to confide in. This person can help you stay motivated, can support you when you feel emotional, and can help you out if you're not feeling well enough to do things around the house by yourself.It's best to talk to the person you choose before you stop taking Prozac and explain the symptoms you might experience, as well as your reasons for wanting to stop taking the medication.
There are also a variety of support groups online. These may be helpful if you would like some information regarding what to expect from other people who have experienced Prozac withdrawal, or even just some encouragement.
Some areas have crisis lines and hotlines that you can call for help and support. You can also try an online chat line if you are feeling suicidal.

, In order to avoid the depression or anxiety you were experiencing before you started taking Prozac, it's important to have a plan for how you will combat these symptoms. Depending on your unique circumstances, you may want to try therapy, a different medication, or even lifestyle changes, such as a healthier diet and increased exercise.


You may feel depressed or anxious while your body is withdrawing from Prozac, but it may not be a relapse of the condition that caused you to take the drug in the first place. If your symptoms are only temporary, they are likely just a symptom of withdrawal, so do your best to cope with them. If you continue to feel depressed or anxious even after the other symptoms of withdrawal have passed, you may be experiencing a relapse, so talk to your doctor about your treatment options right away.Your doctor will have to monitor your mental status and your risk for suicide. Studies have shown people on antidepressants have a higher risk than placebo for suicidial ideation.

, In order to help your body function at its best, it's important to take up some healthy habits. Make sure that you eat a balanced diet, stay hydrated, exercise, and get lots of sleep.Try to establish a regular schedule and reduce your stress as well, as this will increase your chances of being able to combat your depression and anxiety without Prozac.Cut yourself a little slack and let yourself relax while you withdraw from Prozac. Try to avoid committing yourself to anything strenuous or stressful, as you may not be feeling up to participating.

, You may experience fever-like symptoms while withdrawing from Prozac, so it's a good idea to dress in layers.This will allow you to strip down to a light layer when you feel sweaty, and to bundle up when you get the chills.

, There are a variety of over-the-counter supplements that may help reduce certain symptoms you are experiencing during Prozac withdrawal. It is important to talk to your doctor before you start taking any supplements, as they may interact with one another or with other medications you are taking.If you are unable to sleep, you may want to take Melatonin.
If you are feeling fatigued, you may want to take a Vitamin B complex or Rhodiola Rosea.
If you are feeling depressed, anxious, or irritable you may want to try Sam-e or magnesium. St. John's Wart can be helpful in treating depression as well, but overlapping its use with Prozac is not recommended, because St. John's Wart can make Prozac's side effects worse; wait two weeks after you finish taking Prozac to try St. John's Wart.If you are experiencing brain zaps or mental fogginess, omega-3 fatty acids (like fish oil or krill oil) may help.

, If your symptoms become severe, your doctor may be able to offer you some relief by prescribing a medication to help combat nausea or insomnia. These will be taken for a very short period of time., It's important to keep in mind that withdrawal symptoms are temporary and are not dangerous or damaging to your health. Try not to panic if you experience unusual symptoms like brain zaps.


Feel free to contact your doctor if you are having trouble coping with your symptoms. He or she may be able to offer you additional advice on how to reduce the symptoms, which may include temporarily increasing your dosage of Prozac. Your doctor can also help you identify if you have any symptoms that are not related to Prozac withdrawal.

Consider joining a meditation class or follow simple online instructions on how to meditate.
It is important to meditate or perform relaxation techniques on a regular basis to reap the benefits of this mental calming process.

, Exercise can be a safe and effective way to reduce anxiety during pregnancy, and yoga is acclaimed for its ability to calm the mind and provide a sense of calm and peace.


The hormonal effects of gentle exercise – particularly when combined with meditative mental exercises – can help alleviate stress and anxiety without medication.
Physical activity releases feel-good hormones, so regular exercise is essential to keeping a steady dose of these chemicals providing antianxiety effects in the brain.

, Certain scents, such as bergamot and sandalwood, can ease mental tension and reduce anxiety. Consider purchasing essential oils of a few calming fragrances and using them with lotion, in a bath, or in an oil burner to create a relaxing atmosphere and prevent anxiety.

Prevent rejection of the donor liver by taking immunosuppressive medications.,
Watch for signs of liver transplant rejection.,
See your doctor regularly for follow-up visits.,
Follow a careful diet.,
Avoid physical activity, according to your doctor's instructions.",How to Recover From a Liver Transplant at Home," Take these as prescribed by your doctor.


Immunosuppressive medications lower your body's natural resistance to foreign substances, like your donor liver. In most cases, immunosuppressive medications have to be taken for the rest of the patient's life. However, as the body adjusts to the new liver, dosage amounts may be decreased, and a few patients have been able to stop taking the medication completely. Doctors cannot predict how and when dosages of these medications may be altered, since it varies from patient to patient.
In addition to protecting the new liver, immunosuppressant medications also leave patients more vulnerable to infection and illness. During the first 3 to 6 months of the medication, patients are usually advised to avoid people who are sick to avoid picking up an infection. Additional medication may be prescribed during this period to reduce the risk of infections as well.;
, Call your doctor right away if symptoms arise.


Some of the symptoms to watch for during liver transplant recovery include pain around the liver, fever and dark-colored urine. Jaundice is also a warning sign that the donor liver may not be working properly. Jaundice is usually detected through a yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes.

, They will probably be weekly for the first month, and then monthly until your doctor is satisfied that your donor liver is functioning normally.


Doctor's visits after liver transplant surgery will probably include blood tests and blood pressure checks to be sure the liver is functioning normally and screen for other possible complications. The specific type of testing and the frequency will vary somewhat from patient to patient, depending on how recovery is progressing.

, A proper diet will prevent weight gain due to water retention, a common problem after liver transplant surgery.


A lower salt intake is important to prevent water retention. A healthy, balanced diet consisting of plenty of whole grains and fresh fruits and vegetables will also promote healing and keep the body in top condition throughout the recovery process.

, Your doctor will let you know when your liver transplant recovery is complete and when you can resume physical activity.


While individual recovery times vary from patient to patient, most are able to resume all of their previous physical activity within 6 months to 1 year. Sex is usually allowed when other physical activity may be resumed. Some patients find they can actually do more after surgery, since they now have a healthy, disease-free liver.

Determine if your plants are ready to harvest.,
Harvest and prepare the plant for drying.,
Dry the branches.,
Prepare the marijuana for curing.,
Cure the marijuana.,
Let the marijuana cure for up to six months.,
Storing your buds.",How to Grow Medical Marijuana6," Your plants will be ready to harvest 2 to 4 months after starting the flowering stage. There are two methods to determine when your plant is ready to harvest:Pistils (the white hairs on the flowers) – Wait until new white hairs have stopped growing. Harvest when 50-75% of the hairs have darkened for the highest THC level. Harvest when 80-90% have darkened for more CBN, which has a relaxing effect.
Trichomes – Trichomes are the ""crystals"" or glitter that accumulate on your buds during the flowering stage. Use a magnifier to examine the ones with mushroom-like heads on the ends. Harvest when most trichomes are milky or cloudy for the most intense high. Wait until they are amber for a more relaxing, narcotic type high.

, Using a sharp knife, cut the plant off at the stalk above the ground. Remove the large fan leaves. Using scissors, cut each branch from the plant. Handle them gently so as to not lose any trichomes (the clear buds that contain THC).Leaving the smaller leaves on the plant will result in a slower drying time, which means more flavor and potency.

, Hang the branches upside down with plenty of space between them to ensure even drying and to prevent the growth of mold. Keep them at room temperature to prevent drying too fast, and use a fan to promote air circulation (don't point the fan directly at the marijuana). You'll know your marijuana is dry enough when the smaller stems crack instead of bending when you flex them. Drying usually takes about a week., Use small scissors to remove any remaining leaves shielding the buds. (These trimmings contain some active ingredients and can be used in cooking.) Separate the individual buds from the stems and place them in 1 quart mason jars so the jars are about 75% full.

, During curing the marijuana will very, very slowly continue to dry out, and compounds that give it a grassy smell and taste will break down. The key is to try to keep the air in the jars at 60-65% relative humidity (RH). You'll want to open your jars at least once a day for the first 1-2 weeks to ensure they are curing properly and to allow for air exchange. A hygrometer can help you get accurate RH readings. Leave it in the jar for 24 hours to get an accurate reading.Wet buds (over 70% RH) – If buds feel damp to the touch take them out to dry for another 12-24 hours. Wet buds in a jar run the risk of growing mold.
Moist buds (65-70% RH) – If you shake the jar and some buds stick together, then they are too moist. Take the lid off the jar for 2-4 hours.
Sticky buds (60-65% RH) – This is the zone where you want your buds to be. Buds feel a little sticky. They are neither wet, nor dry and crumbly. They do not clump together when you shake the jar.
Dry buds (less than 60%RH) – If the buds feel brittle and crumbly, then insert a 62% Humidipak to restore moisture. Continue opening the jar once a day.

, After the first 2 weeks, your jars should all be in the cure zone (sticky, 60-65% RH). You can now open them once a week to check on them. After 4-6 weeks, you can start opening them once a month. You should cure for at least 3 months, but buds will continue to improve for up to 6 months. After that, you'll want to put them in long-term storage.

, Make sure your buds are not wet, or they will mold in long-term storage. Humidity should be 62% or slightly less.Short-term storage (under 6 months) – Put the buds in an airtight container, such as the mason jars or a Ziploc bag. Store in a cool, dark place.
Long-term storage (over 6 months) – Consider vacuum sealing your buds to ensure they retain flavor and potency.

Check to see if home cultivation is allowed in your state.,
Become eligible to use medical marijuana.In all states where you can grow marijuana, you will need a doctor's prescription in order to do so legally.,
Determine how much you can grow.,
Know the limits on how it can be used.",How to Grow Medical Marijuana7," Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, and the District of Columbia all allow the use of medical marijuana, but you cannot grow your own marijuana in these states. You can grow medical marijuana in the following states:You can cultivate without restrictions in Alaska, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington
A special license is required in New Mexico.
In Arizona you can only cultivate if you lived 25 miles or more form a dispensary when you apply for a card
In Nevada you can cultivate if you live 25 or more mile form a dispensary, if you are unable to travel to a dispensary, or if the dispensary does not carry the strains you need.

, In most states, you will also need to register with the state. Here are the requirements in states where personal cultivation is allowed:


Registration mandatory: Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, Rhode Island, and Vermont
Registration voluntary: California, Maine, New Mexico
No registration required: Washington

, Most states that allow home cultivation put a limit on the number of plants you can grow at one time, with that limit generally ranging from 6 to 12 plants. For a breakdown of how much marijuana you can grow in each state, see http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=000881#details.

, In most states where marijuana is legal, you can use it in any form – liquid, pill, vaporized, or smoked. However, it is illegal to smoke medical marijuana in Minnesota and New York."
"
Determine if you can legally grow marijuana for sale.,
Know the requirements.,
Research the market.,
Locate buyers for your product.",How to Grow Medical Marijuana8," In most of the twenty-two states (plus DC) where marijuana is legal, you must acquire a license in order to legally cultivate marijuana. Of these states, only three are currently issuing licenses, and five more have plans to do so. Even in states that allow cultivation, many cities have municipal bans, so you'll want to be sure cultivation is legal where you are.


Arizona – Only dispensaries are allowed to grow marijuana for sale. You can find instructions on how to apply for a dispensary license at http://azdhs.gov/documents/licensing/medical-marijuana/dispensaries/DRC-ApplicationInstructions.pdf.
Connecticut – You will need to acquire a producer license. This requires a non-refundable $25,000 application fee and a $75,000 registration fee.Oregon – A license is required. You can find information on how to apply at http://www.oregon.gov/olcc/marijuana/Documents/Licensing_Forms/mj_app_producer_cultivation_plan.pdf.
States where a license is required, but licenses have not yet been issued: Alaska, California,Hawaii, Illinois,and Maryland.States where licenses are required, but no more are currently being issued: Delaware,Maine,Minnesota, Nevada,New Hampshire,New Jersey,New Mexico,New York,Rhode Island,Vermont,Washington,and Washington, DC.
States where medical marijuana is legal, but cultivation for sale is illegal: Michigan.

, Most states have strict requirements regulating the growth and processing of medical marijuana. You will be generally required to pay an annual fee for your license, to demonstrate that your growing site is secure, to show that your growing area is not located near a school, and to submit your products for laboratory analysis. Check with your state authority for the particular requirements in your area.

, Growing medical marijuana for sale will probably not make you rich. Medical marijuana is strictly regulated. In Oregon, California, and Arizona, the market is very crowded, resulting in low prices.In Connecticut, the $100,000 cost of acquiring a license makes anything other than a large-scale venture unprofitable. The most attractive options are states that are in the process of issuing licenses: Alaska, Hawaii, Illinois and Maryland.

, In some states, like Arizona, only dispensaries can grow marijuana, so you will be selling your own product. This means you'll need to establish a dispensary as well as growing marijuana. In other states, it is illegal to both grow and sell marijuana. You'll need to find dispensaries to sell to. In these states, it is illegal to sell directly to users.

After a few weeks have passed, you may still need follow-up care at your transplant clinic site several times a year, or at least once a year for the next several years, depending on your health status. You may also be allowed to follow-up with your primary care physician for certain matters.
Your doctor may ask you to take certain vital signs daily and report back to the clinic. You may need to take your weight, temperature, blood pressure, pulse and blood sugar if you are a diabetic.;
, You must be on medication for the rest of your life to prevent kidney rejection.


Wear sunscreen and protective clothing while out in the sun, as the anti-rejection medication will make your skin more sensitive.

, Instead opt for unrefined carbohydrates, snack on fruits and drink water.
Drink more – Your body needs more water when recovering from trauma such as surgery. Water will help your body in many ways. Drink more!
Eat more proteins – proteins are the building blocks of your body; eat more proteins to give your body all it needs to recover. Eat more lean meats, fish, beans, tofu, yogurt and eggs.

Try starting with the lowest settings.,
Place the electrodes at least an inch apart.,
Adjust the amount of electricity slowly, gradually and carefully.,
Remember the setting that works for you.,
Make sure the pads have sufficient gel or water on them.,
Do not place the electrodes on areas of the body which could harm you.,
Do not use TENS at all anywhere on your body if you have a condition that makes it unsafe for you.,
Do not use TENS while you are engaged in certain activities.,
Reduce disappointment by knowing what to expect.,
Learn about what conditions TENS is most likely to help.,
Maximize the benefits by pairing TENS with other pain management techniques.",How to Place Electrodes for a Tens Unit," Then increase them to an effective setting. See a physiotherapist to get help adjusting the settings. This will reduce the likelihood of your using a setting that is too high or too low. Ask about common massage points useful for relaxation on your body. The physiotherapist will have experience and will be able to advise you as to what is best for your condition and what to avoid.To relieve your personal pains find the pain points with finger tips and apply electrode pads around there.
The better settings are different for each person, depending upon how sensitive you are and what your condition is. The body gets resistant to a unit that has only one pattern of electro ""tapping"". Some have a random pattern.;
, This will prevent you from having too much electricity delivered to too small an area.Turn the TENS device off while you are adjusting the electrodes. You can arrange the electrodes in several ways, depending on what works best for you:Around the area that hurts or over acupuncture points that the physiotherapist can show you on a chart.

If the electrodes are colored red and black, you want to position the black electrodes farther from your trunk or torso, such as on your arms or legs, and the red electrodes should be closer to your torso. This will help prevent unpleasant impulses from going to your central nervous system. It will also stimulate muscle contractions.


You can arrange the electrodes in lines, in X formations, or in squares, but they must be at one inch or farther apart. To make an X, place one pair of matched negative and positive electrodes for one diagonal and another pair for the crossing angle.

, Start with the machine off, then turn it on when the dial is at its lowest setting.Slowly raise the electrical current until you feel a pleasant tingling feeling. If it hurts, then the current is too high.
More is not necessarily better. Turning it up too high will not increase the amount of pain relief.
Your body may get used to the effect of a certain level of current after a while. If this happens to you, slowly increase the current slightly.

, Once you know how much electricity is beneficial for you and where to put the electrodes, keep using that setting.This doesn't necessarily mean starting at that setting, which might be painful. Start out with a low number, then increase it slightly until you get to your preferred setting.
You can use TENS as long or as often as you want. If you use it for long periods of time, while doing other things, you can clip it to your belt or keep it in your pocket.
The amount of time that you’re going to use the TENS unit will differ depending on the condition being treated, the chronicity of your health condition and the way your body will respond. A physiotherapist will be able to provide the proper recommendations on the amount of time to use the TENS, in addition to the number of times that you can use the TENS.
Be aware that using it too often will lead to your body getting ‘used’ to the impulses. Eventually, the effects may diminish over time.

, Not only are you going to respond to a certain group of settings more than others, it’s important to know that having enough gel or water on the pads can also result in different experiences. Having enough gel or water can help conduct the impulses better.

, You should not apply electricity to areas that are close to your heart or that are likely to be particularly sensitive. Keep them away from your:Temples
Mouth
Eyes/Ears
Front or side of your neck near the major arteries
Spinal column (can be crossing from opposite sides of the spine though)
Left side of your chest, i.e.: near your heart
Front of your chest with one on your back
Varicose veins
Broken skin or a new scar that is still healing
Areas that are numb

, Some health conditions make using TENS risky.If you have a pacemaker or another electrical device in your body, the electrical impulses could interfere with these devices or their signals, or cause a failure.
If you have epilepsy, you may be more sensitive and it is better not to use TENS.
If you have a disorder which affects the rhythm of your heart/heartbeat, your heart might be particularly sensitive to electrical impulses, and malfunction.
If you are allergic to the electrode pads, you may be able to get hypoallergenic electrode pads.
If you are pregnant or might be pregnant, do not use TENS without it being prescribed. The risks of using TENS during pregnancy aren’t known, so do not use it without consulting your doctor. Some women find it helpful for pain relief during labor pains, but be sure to ask your doctor whether it is safe for you and your baby before using it.
If you are unsure whether TENS is safe for you, consult your doctor.

, These activities make using TENS more risky.If you are in the bath, shower, or swimming pool, the water will change how and where the electricity is conducted.
Do not use TENS while you are sleeping.
If you are driving a motor vehicle the sensations caused by TENS may be a distraction.
If you are operating machinery, do not use TENS to avoid unexpected confrontations.
The electrical impulses that TENS devices produce should not cause problems for airlines, but ask them before you use it during flight.

, TENS usually doesn’t work immediately, so you may need to be patient.Some people find that it takes about 40 minutes of use before their pain subsides.
Most people only experience pain relief while using TENS. When you switch it off, your pain may return.
If the TENS loses its effectiveness, it’s important to make an appointment with your physiotherapist to learn how to change up the settings. This can help in finding the right settings for your specific condition.

, TENS is generally most beneficial for people experiencing pain and / or muscle spasms in certain areas of the body or for certain problems:Back
Knees
Neck
Menstrual cramps
Sports injuries
Arthritis

, While people who can’t take pain medications often find it very helpful, you are most likely to get relief if you use TENS and other methods of pain reduction. TENS can complement:Medication. This includes prescription strength or over-the-counter medications.
Exercise. Ask your doctor what forms of exercise he or she recommends for your condition.
Relaxation techniques. Depending upon what the cause of your pain is, you may be able to use TENS simultaneously with relaxation techniques like meditation, deep breathing, visualizing calming images or yoga.

Seek help before your pain becomes debilitating.",How to Overcome Physical Pain With Your Mind," If your pain is severe, you are likely breathing rapidly and shallowly. In contrast, controlled deep breathing (breathing from the diaphragm and exhaling from the chest) has been shown to harness the parasympathetic nervous system’s “quieting response.”Lay down in a quiet room. Turn off any distractions and reduce any exterior factors that may over-stimulate you. You may choose to close your eyes or focus them on a specific point.Try to focus on nothing but inhalation and exhalation. If you can realize that you are in control of your body and take charge of your own breathing, you may be better able to prevent the pain from controlling you. Once you are breathing deeply, muscle relaxation may come naturally. Try to let go of all feeling in your body and remain focused only on breathing.
Women practicing Lamaze breathing techniques in childbirth are utilizing the benefits of controlling breathing to lessen pain.;
, If deep diaphragmatic breathing alone fails to provide you with relief, there are other options for calming tight muscles and the pain that accompanies them.


Progressive relaxation has been shown to be an effective form of muscle relaxation that requires no external stimuli.Begin with your toes, then work you way up through the muscles in the rest of the body until you reach your face. For each muscle, first slowly contract the muscle, then relax it, waiting until it is fully released before moving upward.
When your mind alone fails to bring muscle relation, consider adding pressure point therapy. Research shows that finding pressure points associated with your specific type of pain and compressing them with your fingers reduces muscle tension, thereby alleviating pain. Be careful not to continue activating a pressure point if it seems to be worsening your pain when you remove your fingers, however., Visualization, also called guided imagery, involves coming up with a detailed situation and the emotions that accompany it. In study after study, visualization has been shown to aid relaxation and provide pain relief. In the case of severe or chronic pain, visualization often, but not always, means imagining a situation in which you are pain-free, at ease, and feeling well and unstressed. The key is finding a visualization that works for you.


A common successful form of visualization involves imaging all of the sensations association with being in a warm bathtub or lounging on a beach. Research suggests that both the sacred and the profane provide excellent visualization topics, too. According to one Johns Hopkins study, thinking of a sexual fantasy worked better at reducing pain than thinking of more “vanilla” topics.For others, focusing on religious or spiritual thoughts worked helped at coping with pain.Another odd, but effective, visualization topic is food. One University of Wisconsin study found that just thinking about food alleviates pain.For example, try imagining a decadent dessert or your favorite Sunday dinner.

, Some research suggests that, instead of thinking of other sensations, you might want to focus on separating yourself from your pain.


Try “disassociation” (imagining that the painful part of your body is separate from the rest of your body, far away from your mind). Consider visualizing your pain as a giant blob, a loud noise, or a bright light. The trick is to imagine that you are gradually reducing the irritating quality of the symbol — shrinking the size of the blob, making the noise quiet, or dimming the light. As you reduce that irritation, you’ll reduce the irritation caused by your pain.You might also imagine the feeling of a numbing agent, like Novocain, being injected into the source of your pain. , If other techniques fail, consider diverting your attention from the part of your body that is in pain to another part of your body.


Instead of thinking about your aching head or burning hands, for example, focus on your feet. Consider all of the sensations that you usually ignore and give them your focus. Pay attention to the texture of your socks. Wiggle your toes and feel them rub against one another. In short, ""tune in"" to all of the sensation that you normally ""tune out"" because you're primary focus is on your pain.

, Numerous studies have shown that mindfulness meditation substantial reduces pain.In fact, recent studies suggest that meditation may be able to actually change how the brain processes pain.Done correctly, meditation can help pain suffers move their focus from their body.


Begin simply, with brief sessions of 10 or 15 minutes so that the practice does not seem too overwhelming or burdensome.Sit in a comfortable position on the floor (or in a chair if your pain limits your ability to sit on the floor). Pay attention to your deep, measured breathing, and focus on an object or on mentally repeating a soothing or uplifting phrase (this is called a mantra).
It may take a bit of practice to get the hang of meditation, but it is a powerful way to decrease the intensity of chronic pain.
If you’re still struggling to mediate, audio guides to mindfulness meditation are available for free from Ronald Siegel, and assistant professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School.For a short-term dose of meditation’s benefits, say a mantra by itself. Repeating a mantra for as little as thirty seconds has ben shown to reduce pain.Many experts suggest picking a neutral or positive work, but research also shows that, for some suffers of pain, shouting a curse word actually works better than saying a neutral word!, Pain has a way of absorbing all of our attention, but we can fight back by focusing on things we enjoy, such as watching a movie, playing a game, or spending time with a friend.Laughter, in particular, has been shown to reduce pain by releasing endorphins.So going to the comedy club or seeing your favorite comedy film might, quite literally, be a form of medicine.
Listening to music is another activity shown to be especially successful in helping people with chronic pain. Studies have shown that listening to music as little as one hour a day reduces chronic pain.Music decreases pain and feelings of depression while increasing the listener’s sense of power.Studies show that “pleasing” music, in particular, offers the most pain reduction., Suffers of chronic pain understandably cut back on their social activity. However, doing so can be counterproductive.


Making plans with family and friends can boost your mood and distract you from your pain. In fact, simply thinking of friends and family reduces pain. Studies show that viewing pictures of loved ones, such as romantic partners, increases the body’s resistance to pain., Art therapy has become a popular technique for dealing with chronic pain.Not only does creative activity provide you with a distraction from your pain, it also provides you with an outlet to express any anger or frustration you're feeling because of your pain.


There's no ""right"" type of creative activity. Go for the hobby that interests you most, whether its painting, knitting, beading, or anything else.
For example, writing has also been shown to reduce pain. One of the most effective methods is to write for 15 minutes before bed, putting any worries or concerns down on paper so that you can remove them from your mind and allow yourself to get restful sleep., If all other forms of distraction fail, consider seeking professional assistance. Psychologists can help you take your mind off of your chronic pain.


According to the American Psychological Association, hypnosis designed to decrease pain — known as “hypno-analgesia” — has been shown to be effective in controlled experiments.Psychologists can help reduce chronic pain in other ways, too, such as through the use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy., According to brain scans, chronic pain suffers actually have more brain tissue dedicated to experiencing pain. This extra tissue is thought to develop, in part, due to the extra focus chronic pain suffers necessarily dedicate to their pain — a relationship between brain and body that highlights the role the mind has in mediating how we experience pain.


When we experience pain, our instinct is to focus on it and judge its severity, both of which can only make the pain worse and contribute to related anxiety and depression. In this way, our mind can significantly amplify our “primary pain” (the actual injury) by adding “secondary pain” (our thoughts about the injury, which amplify the pain).

, Because of its ability to reduce stress and anxiety, mindfulness is becoming a topic of interest everywhere from academia to the military to corporate board rooms.. For those suffering from chronic pain, mindfulness can help “turn own the volume” on the secondary pain by soothing the parts of the brain that generate this secondary pain


""Mindfulness” techniques have been shown to help reduce chronic pain by as much as 57 percent.While the biological effects of mindfulness are still being studied, some of its benefits are already clear. For example, mindfulness has been shown decrease the levels of stress hormones in the body, allowing the body to more efficiently focus on fighting inflammation.Beyond mindfulness's direct effects on pain, it can boost your mood. Studies show that individuals with chronic pain often understandably also succumb to chronic negative thinking and depression. Mindfulness, however, can reduce depression and increase positive thinking., The term ""mindfulness"" encapsulates many different techniques, including deep breathing and meditation (both of which are discussed below). Mindfulness has been described by one clinical psychologist as ""paying attention to something on purpose and with fresh eyes.""In its broadest sense, mindfulness attempts to help you live in the moment and slow down, particularly during times of stress or pain.


For example, instead of picking up your cup of coffee or tea and drinking without thinking, pay attention to the texture of the cup, its weight, and the shape of the handle. Note the feeling of the cup on your lips. Let the sip of liquid linger on your tongue, paying attention to the flavors.Search for more everyday opportunities to be mindful. When you brush you teeth, pay attention to the sensation, rather than letting yourself think about your job — or your pain — as you brush .One common mindfulness technique that can be used in everyday life is sensory isolation. Instead of letting yourself be bombarded by every sensation — including pain — focus on one of your senses, such as sound. Focus on all of the sounds around you. Listen for small sounds that you usually ignore.The key in everyday mindfulness is to more fully experience a detail in life that's not your pain. These small moments of mindfulness can help alleviate symptoms of pain at times, such as when you're at work, that you can't give your full attention to relaxation or mediation.

, If you suffer from low-grade pain that you'll likely live with for a long time, it's worthwhile to practice managing it with your mind. Techniques like visualization and mindfulness can help improve your quality of life. Dealing with chronic pain is never easy, but you may be able to focus on it less and lift your spirits if you learn how to manage your pain mentally.

, Migraines, cramps, and even needlesticks are forms of short-term pain that can be dealt with mentally, with practice. If you're averse to relying too heavily on pain medication, it's worth learning how to distract yourself or breathe through the pain until you've made it to the other side.

, The mental component doesn't have to be the only form of pain management you use. Consider practicing mental pain relief techniques in conjunction with other methods, like using medicine, getting massages, trying acupuncture, and so on. Find the combination of methods that works best for your body and your situation. Be sure to consult your physician to help you come up with a healthy plan.

, While the thought of overcoming pain without medication may seem like the brave thing to do, it also takes mental strength to get the help you need to keep your body in good shape. Pain is a signal that something is going wrong in the body. Don't push yourself too far before you seek medical attention to get proper treatment and relief.

Assess the surface of the wound.,
Measure the wound surface using the Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing.,
Measure the wound depth vs the approximate percentage of wound granulation.,
Cleanse the wound.,
Measure the wound dimensions using the linear measurement or ‘clock technique’.,
Place the ruler on the widest portion of the width from 3 o’clock to 9 o’clock.,
Find the wound’s depth.,
Learn the different phases of wound healing.,
Recognize the inflammatory phase.,
Spot the proliferative phase.,
Identify the remodelling or maturation phase.",How to Measure Wound Granulation," Complete wound assessment should include the history of how the wound was acquired, the anatomic location of the wound and the stage or phase of wound healing.


It is crucial to note the length, width and depth of the wound in centimeters, in addition to whether the wound is tunneling or undermining. Look for signs of infection such as redness, pain and drainage. Check for necrotic and granulation tissue.
Necrotic tissues are characterized by reddish brown fragmentation and form thick and leathery black eschar (dead tissue). Oftentimes, this masks an underlying collection of pus or an abscess.
Meanwhile, healthy granulation tissues appear as shiny, uneven or bumpy, beefy red at the wound base.;
, Get the length and width of the wound in centimeters, scored at 0 to 10. Take note of any exudates (fluids seeping from the wound) and rate 0 for none down to 3 when exudates are heavy.


Also document the type of tissue using the 0 to 4 scale rating: 0 for a closed or resurfaced wound, 1 for superficial epithelial tissue, 2 for granulation tissue, 3 for slough tissues characterized by yellow to white tissues with mucous and 4 as a necrotic tissue.
Get the sum and place it on a graph to monitor any changes or progress in the condition of the wound.

, Clinicians measure the wound depth using the granulation tissue. A significant decrease in wound depth indicates a remarkable proliferation of granulation tissue. A significant decrease is measured as at least a 0.2 centimeter (0.1 in) change in depth compared to the previous assessment., First, wash your hands with soap under running water to prevent the spread of bacteria and other microorganisms. Dry your hands with a clean towel. Put on a pair of clean rubber gloves.


Remove the soiled wound dressing and dispose of it properly. Dress the wound with fresh gauze.

, Get the longest length, width and depth of the wound with the body as an imaginary clock using a ruler measured in centimeters.


Keep in mind that the length may not be the longest measurement here. Sometimes, the width may be longer than the length depending on the clock position.

, This allows you to measure the width of the wound. When getting the length, remember that the heels are at 12 o’clock and toes at 6 o’clock. Place the ruler over the longest portion of the wound.

, Get the wound depth using a cotton pledget or applicator dipped in a normal saline solution to measure the deepest part of the wound bed.


Remove the applicator and hold it against the ruler to measure the depth of the wound margin based on the mark seen on the applicator stick.
Then, estimate the amount of wound granulation in congruence to the percentage of the wound surface. Be sure to document your assessment findings properly.

, It’s important to understand the physiologic process of wound healing in order to effectively manage and treat wounds properly.

, The inflammatory phase is the body’s first line of defense against injury. It occurs when the blood vessels contract and release potent vasoconstrictors or chemical compounds that cause blood vessels to constrict in order to limit, if not to stop the bleeding.


At this point, the body sends white blood cells - particularly the neutrophils and macrophages - to the site of the wound to kill bacteria and promote wound healing.
The inflammatory phase usually lasts around 2 to 4 days from the time of wound injury.

, Overlapping with the inflammatory process, the proliferative phase begins around the third day, coinciding with the release of macrophages. The macrophages are responsible for attracting one of the most important cells, the fibroblasts, which initiate collagen and granulation tissue formation.


Healthy granulation tissue should not easily bleed and will appear pinkish or reddish in color. Dark granulation tissue indicates poor tissue perfusion or insufficient oxygen and nutrient levels. It may also indicate ischemia or infection.Ischemia is characterized by a bluish discoloration around the wound which indicates poor tissue perfusion. It occurs when the blood flow to the capillaries or small vascular beds and blood vessels is impeded.
Wound healing sets in when homeostasis between the collagen synthesis and breakdown is achieved.

, The production of collagen continues even after wound healing. Collagen is a protein made of amino acids. It helps strengthen the structures of the body by acting like cement.


During the maturation phase, remodeling or replacement of Type III collagen with Type I collagen takes place until such a time that the collagen tissue almost equates to the texture of normal skin and mimics approximately 80% of uninjured tissue.

Use an ice pack.,
Numb small areas with topical anesthetic creams.,
Take oral painkillers.",How to Numb Skin1," When you cool your skin, it constricts the blood vessels. This reduces the blood flow to the area and can relieve swelling, irritation, and muscle spasms. This is particularly good for soothing bruises and minor injuries.If you don’t have an ice pack already prepared in the freezer, you can use a bag of ice cubes or frozen vegetables.
Always wrap the ice pack in a towel instead of putting it directly on your skin. This will help prevent frostbite.
After 20 minutes, remove the ice pack from your skin and let your skin warm up. After 10 minutes you can put it on again if you need to.;
, These creams are often available over-the-counter and can soothe sunburns, minor burns, insect bites, stings, and minor abrasions. Always consult your doctor if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, treating a child or a senior citizen, or are taking other medications, herbal remedies, or supplements that could interact. Read and follow the instructions on the packaging.You can usually buy these products at your local pharmacy as sprays, ointments, creams, patches, and pre-prepared bandages.
The medications may contain: benzocaine, benzocaine and methol, butamben, dibucaine, lidocaine, pramoxine, pramoxine and methol, tetracaine, or tetracaine and methol. If you are unsure about the dosages or how often to apply it, consult your doctor. Your doctor will be able to make recommendations based on your particular condition and medical history.
Check the expiration dates. Do not use expired medications.
Stop using these medications and consult your doctor if you see no improvement after a week, the area gets infected, develops a rash, or starts burning or stinging. Symptoms of an overdose include blurred vision, confusion, seizures, dizziness, feeling too hot, too cold, or numb, headache, sweating, ringing in your ears, irregular or slow heartbeat, difficulty breathing, sleepiness. If you show these symptoms, go to the doctor immediately or call an ambulance., Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can relieve pain from arthritis, muscle pain, tooth pain, fever, gout, back pain, headaches, and menstrual cramps. These medications can generally be purchased over-the-counter at local pharmacies. Many can provide relief within a few hours. Do not use them for more than a few days without consulting your doctor. Always consult your doctor before using these medications if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, treating a child, or on other medications, herbal remedies, or supplements.Common medications include: Aspirin (Anacin, Bayer, Excedrin), ketoprofen (Orudis KT), ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, Nuprin), naproxen sodium (Aleve). Aspirin should never be given to children or teenagers because it is associated with Reye’s syndrome.
Do not take these medications without first consulting a doctor if you have high blood pressure, diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, allergies to these medications, ulcers, bleeding problems, high alcohol intake, heart problems, asthma, or are on other medications that may interact such as warfarin, lithium, heart medications, arthritis medications, vitamins, and others.
Common side effects include gas, bloating, heartburn, stomach discomfort, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation. If you have these or any other side effects, contact your doctor immediately.

Wear tight-fitting underpants.,
Wait for your stitches to dissolve.,
Don’t panic if you see light bleeding.,
Take painkillers regularly if you need them.,
Rest on your sofa for a week post-op.,
Don’t work for the first two or three days following surgery.,
Shower daily after the first 48 hours.,
Lift nothing heavy for at least two weeks.,
Don’t ejaculate or have sex for two weeks after surgery.,
Eat nutritious foods.,
Control your expectations of returning to full fertility.,
Resume sexual activity at a rate you’re comfortable with.",How to Recover from a Vasectomy Reversal," You should wear supportive underwear immediately after surgery. Relatively tight, close-fitting underwear will give you greater comfort and support.


Your doctor may supply you with a different type of supportive undergarment. In this case, wear what your doctor gives you.Do not wear uncomfortably tight underwear, as this will increase your discomfort.;
, The sutures should be the type which dissolve on their own (rather than needing to be removed by a doctor).The wound will take seven to 10 days to heal. You will have both internal sutures (to hold together the ends of your vas deferens) and external sutures, to hold shut the small incision made in your scrotum.While you wait for the sutures to dissolve, it’s important that you rest and avoid activity.
Occasionally, you can feel an end of the suture thread protruding. This does not mean that the stitches aren’t working; it is part of the healing process.

, It’s natural for the wound—especially the area around and between the sutures—to produce light spotting.If this happens, wipe away the blood and clean the area, then apply a sterile bandage.


Repeated or serious spotting can indicate a minor infection. If you note frequent bleeding, see your doctor, who may prescribe you antibiotics.
Consult your doctor if you notice serious bleeding; chronic, severe testicular pain; infection around the sutured area; or a notable decrease in the size of your testicles over time., Taking painkillers regularly will reduce the pain from your reversal surgery, and help you recover more quickly. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is safe to take following surgery and your doctor may prescribe you a painkiller as well. While a painkiller such as ibuprofen will reduce post-surgery swelling, it will also thin your blood and can increase light bleeding. Wait 48 hours after surgery to take ibuprofen.To avoid thinned blood during the surgery, do not take ibuprofen for a period of seven days prior to your surgery., Rest is vital for allowing the body to heal internally. You can get up and perform light daily and household activities — you can get up to get a drink or to make something light to eat — but you should avoid any more labor-intense activities.


If you feel discomfort while you are resting, apply an ice pack to your scrotum.You may also use a scrotal support (for example, a rolled-up sock) to decrease pain while you rest.
Since a vasectomy reversal is an outpatient procedure, you will not need to stay in the hospital once the surgery has been completed.That said, you should still rest extensively, almost as if you were still in a hospital bed.

, This is the time you’re your body will be most delicate, and you need to accommodate that by resting as much as possible.In fact, you should plan to not leave your house during these two or three days.


If you work for yourself, then by all means take calls and answer emails but from the sofa, not your desk.
Ideally, plan to take a full week off from work, and plan to spend most of that week resting on your couch.

, Do not shower or bathe in the first 48 hours following your surgery. After this period, you should shower daily to keep the area clean. Gently dry yourself with a clean towel and place sterile gauze against the wound to minimize contamination., This step should be taken seriously — avoid lifting anything heavier than a plate of food or a drink during the first two weeks. Lifting pulls on the abdomen which in turn can push down on the internal sutures.


If you lift something heavy, the internal sutures can be torn apart.
You may need to wait longer to resume strenuous or heavy lifting, in some cases you’ll need to wait for four to six weeks.Pay attention to your comfort and pain levels, and don’t push your body.

, It’s mandatory that you give your reproductive system time to heal following the surgery, and that you not force sperm through your vas deferens before it has fully healed. After the two weeks, once you feel ready, you can resume sexual activity.Follow your doctor’s orders with regards to resuming sexual activity.


If, during intercourse or sexual activity, you feel pain (especially when ejaculating), stop the activity immediately.
In some cases, it may take as long as 21 days to resume sexual activity.

, Not only will healthy eating nourish your body and allow it to heal from the surgery quickly, but the right kind of diet can also maximize your chances of a healthy sperm count.To increase your sperm count through diet:


Focus on fruits and vegetables. These will improve your fertility — aim to eat five or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day.
Avoid dairy and meat products. These have the opposite effect: they lower your sperm count.
Cheese consumption specifically has been tied to a lower sperm count, and meat also lowers fertility.Also decrease your dietary intake of saturated fats and cholesterol.
Take a Vitamin C or multivitamin tablet daily., A vasectomy is considered a permanent procedure — although vasectomy reversals are common, the chances of success are variable. A vasectomy reversal will be most successful if performed within 10 years of the vasectomy. Over time, the likelihood of a successful reversal will decrease.
In cases of a long wait (longer than 10 years) between the vasectomy and the reversal procedure, some men’s bodies can develop antibodies to their own sperm.
It may take between four months to a year for your partner to become pregnant., A vasectomy — and subsequent reversal — can be an emotionally taxing process — not to mention the discomfort and anxiety associated with having surgery in such a delicate area.


Talk with your partner, and let them know any anxieties or discomfort you may have.
Start slow — you don’t need to immediately resume at the level you were having sex prior to your reversal procedure. Both you and your partner should only engage in activities that you’re comfortable with.
That said, frequent ejaculation will help keep the pathway through your vas deferens open for sperm."

Ask your doctor about cooling sprays.,
Consult your doctor about topical creams.,
Discuss other types of anesthesia with your doctor.",How to Numb Skin2," Ethyl chloride (Cryogesic) can sprayed onto skin right before a painful procedure. The liquid is sprayed onto your skin, which will then feel cold as it evaporates. Your skin will warm up within a few minutes. The spray is only effective as pain relief for as long as it takes your skin to warm up.This may be done immediately before a child receives a medical treatment that involves using a needle. It can be a good substitute for other topical anesthetics if the child is allergic to them.
Do not apply the cooling spray more often or in greater amounts than recommended by the doctor. It can cause frostbite.
Always read and follow the instructions on the packaging. Consult a doctor before applying it to a child or if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.
Keep it out of your eyes, nose, mouth, and open wounds.

, If your doctor expects that you will need pain relief from a procedure you will be undergoing, you may be given an anesthetic to apply shortly before the procedure. Your doctor may ask you to cover the medication with a bandage while it is absorbed into your skin. Do not apply it to your nose, mouth, ears, eyes, genitals, or broken skin. Two frequently used types include:Tetracaine (Ametop Gel). This gel is smeared on the skin a half hour to 45 minutes before the procedure for which you need to be numbed. You can remove it right before the procedure. You will be numb for up to six hours. It may make your skin red where you applied it.
Lidocaine and prilocaine(EMLA cream). You can apply this an hour before the procedure and then remove it right before the procedure. It will be effective for up to two hours. A side effect is that it may make your skin look white.

, If your doctor thinks that local, topical anesthetics might not be sufficient, he or she may suggest numbing larger areas of your body. This is commonly done for procedures which may go below the skin, childbirth, or surgeries. Possibilities include:A regional anaesthetic. Regional anesthetics do not put you to sleep, but they numb a larger area of your body than local anesthetics. You may receive these as local injections. When a woman receives epidural anesthesia during childbirth, this is a regional anesthetic which numbs the lower half of her body.
General anesthesia. This is done for many surgical procedures. You may receive the anesthetic either as an intravenous medication or inhale it as a gas. Side effects can include: nausea, vomiting, dry or sore throat, chills, tiredness."

Know that you will most likely be sent home shortly after surgery.A carpal tunnel release surgery is generally done as an ""outpatient procedure,"" meaning that you show up during the day, receive the surgery, and are sent home the same day.,
Wear a bandage or splint after surgery.For approximately one week following the procedure (or for however long your surgeon advises), you will need to wear a bandage or splint.,
Use ice as needed.Studies examining the use of ice following surgery have had conflicting results, meaning that some patients noticed a difference in their pain levels while others did not.,
Consider pain medication.You can start with over-the-counter pain medications as needed, such as Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or Ibuprofen (Advil).,
Know which complications to look out for.As you heal, it is important to be on the lookout for any potential complications that may arise following surgery.,
Quit smoking.If you are a smoker and have been contemplating quitting, now is the time to do so.,
Begin a physical therapy rehabilitation program.This will consist of motions and exercises that improve the mobility of your wrist and hand.,
Adjust your duties at work as needed.When you are in the midst of recovering, you want to avoid stressing or straining your wrist and hand by doing the same activities that triggered carpal tunnel syndrome in the first place.,
Be aware of your expected prognosis.It normally takes several weeks to several months to recover fully from a carpal tunnel release surgery.,
Know what to do if your symptoms return.If you notice a return of painful and bothersome symptoms following your carpal tunnel release surgery, or if your symptoms simply fail to improve with surgery, it is important to see your doctor again.",How to Recover After Carpal Tunnel Release Surgery," It is very rare that anyone would need to stay overnight, or be officially admitted for a hospital stay, for this surgery. Therefore, excluding unforeseen complications, you can expect to be sent home on the same day.;
, The nurse (or the surgeon) will put this on prior to you leaving the hospital. The purpose is to keep your wrist and hand properly aligned during the initial healing stages.


Your doctor will ask you to return for a follow-up visit approximately one week later.
At this time, she will assess your initial healing, and will most likely remove the bandage or splint.
She will also provide you with further instructions regarding what to expect with your recovery moving forwards.

, You can try icing for 10–20 minutes at a time as a strategy for pain relief in the days following surgery. It may help to control pain, and also to diminish swelling (inflammation) in the area.

, Follow the dosing on the bottle or your doctor's instructions. For many people, this is sufficient; however, if you find the pain is still bothering you and interfering with your daily function, you can speak to your physician about receiving prescription strength pain medication.


The pain should begin to subside a few days to a week or so after surgery.
If your pain is worsening and not improving, contact your physician. Tell him what is going on, and he will determine whether or not you need to come in sooner than a routine follow-up.

, Things to be aware of include:


Pain that steadily increases, rather than decreases, following surgery.
A fever and/or redness, swelling, and discharge from the area that was operated on. Any of these may be signs of an infection.
Bleeding from the surgical site — this is abnormal and will require evaluation from your doctor.
If you notice any of the complications above, contact your doctor to check in and to treat any complications as needed.

, Smoking has been shown to interfere with healing, including potentially interfering with optimal healing after surgery. If you want to give your wrist and hand the best shot at full healing following a carpal tunnel release surgery, quitting smoking can help with this (not to mention the numerous other health benefits it provides).


If you are interested in quitting smoking, speak to your family doctor who can help you with this.
There are a variety of medications available that can help to tame your cigarette cravings.
There are also nicotine replacement options that can substitute for the nicotine you used to get from cigarettes, as you begin a smoking cessation program.
Ideally, you would quit smoking at least four weeks before receiving the surgery. However, quitting at any time is beneficial and will help with the healing process.

, The rehabilitation program will also focus on strengthening the muscles needed for you to regain function of your wrist and hand moving forwards.


Physiotherapists are specifically trained to help you maximize muscular strength and joint mobility in your carpal tunnel region, so adhering to the program they design for you will play an important role in determining how well you recover from surgery.

, For instance, if you normally work a desk job that involves a lot of typing, it is important to know that typing with your injured hand and wrist will likely worsen healing and not help it (until you are far enough along in the recovery stages).


Ask your boss if you can switch to something that does not involve excessive wrist and/or hand movement while you recover.
Alternatively, if you cannot switch jobs, you may need to opt for typing slowly with one hand in order not to exacerbate your injury, and to help with recovery. Consider using a trackball or trackpad instead of a mouse while recovering as these put less pressure on the wrist when used
If you have coverage, you may opt for a short-term leave from work while you recover so that your job does not negatively interfere with the healing process.
Patients are often advised to take at least one week off prior to resuming desk duties, and more for forms of work where the type of labor puts more strain on their wrist or hand. Return-to-work expectations vary significantly depending upon your type of employment., In most cases, the results are good if the surgery went well (if there were issues during surgery, that is another consideration altogether and your surgeon will discuss this with you on a case-by-case basis). Assuming your surgery was successful and free of complications, and that you follow the proper protocols for recovery, you can expect an overall improvement in function after the surgery.


There is one medical study that has been done to follow up with patients approximately five years after carpal tunnel release surgery.
In this study, just over 50% of patients reported a slight return of symptoms after two or more years; however, for almost all of them, the return of symptoms was mild and not bothersome enough to seek further medical attention., It is possible that carpal tunnel syndrome was the wrong diagnosis, and that there is in fact something else going on. If the diagnosis was correct, your doctor can perform tests to see if repeat surgery is indicated, or if alternative methods of pain control such as an injection may be more beneficial in your case.


The best course of action is highly variable from case to case, so it is important to see your physician sooner rather than later if you are suffering from ongoing pain.

Follow your doctor's advice to the letter.,
Take your medication until advised otherwise.,
Rest.,
Start small.,
Set goals for your recovery with a doctor.",How to Recover1," Your doctor or physical therapist has years of experience helping people come back from injuries, and they can give you specific advice to help you feel better.;
, Even if you feel better, you need to complete your prescription or risk new infections. Many ""super-bugs,"" like MRSA, are the result of people skipping the last few days of their drugs. This gives any remaining bacteria a chance to become immune to the drug, making them harder to fight later.

, The most important thing you can do to recover is nothing at all. You need to give your body time to get better without risking further injury.


After serious injuries, sleep is your best friend. Stay in bed, getting out once or twice a day to stretch and move around.

, You aren't going to be back in your normal routine the day after intense physical trauma. You need to be honest with yourself and work on the small things before moving on to bigger, more complex tasks. Focus on getting the little things right and the big things will follow in time.


Go for a short walk each morning, extending it by 1-2 minutes every day.
Read the newspaper or try out the crossword to keep your mind active and engaged with the world.
Ask a loved one to accompany you on small errands or tasks to help you and look out for future injuries.

, If you can't wait to get back on the basketball court, talk to you doctor about the steps you need to take to make it possible. Having a tangible end goal for your recovery makes it much easier to commit to getting better.

Regret
Depression
Anger, Don't feel ""weak"" because you want to cry. In order to come to terms with your emotions, you need to acknowledge them. Find a friend or family member to talk to, write down your feelings, or see a professional therapist to help move the coping process along.


Don't feel like you need to grieve in a certain way. This process is personal and you should accept the feelings and expressions that feel right to you.

, It is all too easy to let negative emotions overwhelm us and drown out the wonderful parts of life. Find things you enjoy doing and do them -- pick up an old hobby, chat with friends, cook your favorite meal -- finding the positive makes it easier to cope with hurtful feelings or emotions.


Many studies show that our mindset while coping with grief profoundly affects how we feel 1-2 years later, so positive feelings now will help you stay positive in the future., Even if you only jot your thoughts down in a journal, finding a way to express your thoughts helps you to face them head on. By writing or forming your thoughts through art, you make them tangible and easier to manage.


Music therapy, which is therapy done by listening to calming music or by playing an instrument, has been shown to take your mind off of pain and help you cope.

, There is a strong correlation between our physical and mental health,and taking care of one will benefit the other. Eat well, exercise, and get enough sleep, especially when you feel sluggish or unwilling to move., Talking to people who understand your pain is a valuable tool to learn about your feelings and cope with your specific issues. Know that you are not alone in your pain. A simple internet search for ""Support Groups"" in your area can help you find a group nearby.


The US Health Department has a detailed list of support groups and ways to contact people on their , There is no ""correct"" amount of time to recover from trauma, so don't let yourself feel rushed. With time, you will learn to cope with the trauma in your own fashion."

Stretch.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Eat some protein.,
Ice sore muscles for 20 minutes every hour.,
Don't work out the same muscle 2 days in a row.,
Rest.",How to Recover3," Stretching after a workout loosens your muscle fibers and kickstarts the recovery process. This is incredibly helpful if you plan on working out the next day as well, so take your time and stretch each muscle for 2-3 minutes.

, You need to start rehydrating immediately to prevent cramps and give your body time to recover. Drink 2-3 glasses of water in the hour after a workout, and keep drinking a glass an hour for the next few hours as well.

, Muscles are made of protein, and they rebuild themselves with protein. Supplying your body with good, lean protein gives it the building blocks necessary for recovery Some foods to try include:


Protein shakes
Eggs
Chicken
Tuna
Peanut butter.

, Ice limits swelling, which can drastically shorten your recovery time between workouts. To avoid frostbite, always keep a towel in between your skin and the ice.


Apply the ice as follows: 20 minutes on, 40 minutes off.

, Take time off of a muscle group, especially when lifting, to prevent injury. Your body needs time to recover and build new muscle tissue before being exerted again. If you did all chest exercises one day, consider doing leg lifts the next.

, The best thing you can do is stop moving. This allows your body the time it needs to rebuild and recover, so don't feel bad about turning on Netflix right after a tough workout. If you need to work out again soon, limit your activity to the basics and give yourself recovery time.


Going for a walk or a light jog is a great way to get your blood moving without causing undue strain.

Do a body squat.,
Do crunches.,
Perform wall sits.,
Do a pelvic tilt.,
Do a pelvic lift.,
Perform the plank exercise.",How to Prevent Back Pain with Exercise3," Body squats help you build your core and hip muscles. Body squats help back pain by strengthening your muscles so you can do actions, like lifting. Better muscle definition can help lessen the chance of future back pain.To do a body squat, make sure your feet are shoulder-width apart. Lower down and push your hips back as your bend your knees. Your weight should be in your heels.
Make sure your knees don’t push forward past your toes. Your chest should be lifted instead of rounded. Keep your lower body parallel to the floor.
Hold for a few seconds, then raise back up.

, Doing partial crunches helps reduce lower back pain by strengthening back and core muscles. Lie flat on the floor with your knees bent. Cross your arms over your chest and raise your shoulders by tightening stomach muscles. Don’t use anything but your core muscles to lift up. Hold for a moment, then release.Do 10 reps.
Make sure your lower back remains flat on the floor during the exercises.

, Wall sits can help you strengthen your hip, core, and leg muscles. Stand a few inches away from the wall and then lean back against the wall. Slide down along the wall until your knees are bent. Press your lower back against the wall.Hold for 10 seconds. Then slide back up. Repeat 10 times.

, Pelvic tilts strengthen core muscles, increase flexibility, and help support the spine. To do a pelvic tilt, lie on the floor with your knees bent. Lift your hips slightly to raise your bottom one to two inches off the floor. Hold for a few seconds, then slowly return.Don’t move your head, neck, or shoulders. Make sure not to arch your back.
Do five lifts to start with. As your fitness level increases, continue to add reps until you get to 20.

, A pelvic lift is similar to a pelvic tilt. Instead of just tilting your hips up, you lift your hips and back off the floor for a deeper stretch.Lie on your back with your knees bent and your arms at your sides. Lift your hips up slowly. Make sure not to arch your back. Your body should be a straight line from your shoulders to knees.
Hold for five seconds. Repeat five times.

, The plank exercise is one of the most effective exercises to strengthen the core muscles. Once you've mastered the basic plank, you can try different variations of the exercise, such as side planks or incorporate an exercise ball.


Begin on your hands and knees. Your palms should be flat on the mat, directly beneath your shoulders.
Keeping your spine straight and engaging your abs (think of pulling your bellybutton toward your spine), extend your legs straight out behind you. Balance your weight on your toes and your hands on the mat.
Hold the position for 10 seconds. Do not let your back sag or let your butt pop into the air. It should appear as though you are about to perform a push-up, with your arms straight and your feet shoulder width apart.

Apply joint compound to the edges of the MDF board.,
Sand the edges after the compound dries.,
Sand the remainder of the MDF board.,
Clean the MDF.,
Apply primer to the MDF.,
Coat the MDF in a solvent based primer, alternatively.,
Sand the MDF after priming.,
Add two more coats of primer.,
Paint the MDF with a water based paint.,
Use a solvent based paint, alternatively.,
Allow the paint to dry and enjoy your finished MDF.",How to Paint MDF," By coating the porous edges of the MDF with joint or drywall compound, you’ll create a smooth edge. With your clean finger or an applicator, like a putty knife, apply a thin, even layer of the compound to all edges on the MDF.Your compound application doesn’t have to be perfect. After the compound dries, you’ll sand it so the finish is smooth and even.;
, Allow the compound to dry completely. The time this takes should be listed on the joint compound’s label instructions. When dry, put on a mask and googles. Use a medium grit silicon-carbide sandpaper, like 220-grit. Use light to moderate pressure to sand the areas with compound until it is smooth and even.Sanding the joint compound should create a fine dust. Use a clean rag to wipe all dust away. Do this carefully; any leftover dust will negatively impact the finish of your paint job., With your dust mask and protective goggles still on, use a fine grit sandpaper, like one rated 120-grit, to lightly sand all the surfaces you will paint on the MDF board. Sanding will produce fine wood dust., Use a clean rag to wipe away dust and any other dirtiness from the MDF. If your MDF is especially dirty, you may need to dampen your rag with water. However, if you do, you’ll need to allow your MDF to dry completely before moving on in the painting process.


For MDF that is particularly dusty, use a vacuum to suck up any that remains following your rag wipe down.

, Take your paintbrush and dip it into the primer. Wipe excess primer onto the inner lip of the paint can. Using long, overlapping strokes, cover the surfaces of your MDF that you will paint with primer. Apply the primer in a thin coat.The edges of MDF can be difficult to finish smoothly and professionally. Be sure you prime the edges completely. Corners of edges can be easily missed.
After applying your first layer of primer, in many cases it may not even appear as though you’ve barely primed. The first layer of primer is often thin enough for you to clearly see the original finish through it., A solvent based primer, like oil-, alcohol-, or lacquer-based ones, will not be as drastically affected by the MDF’s poor water absorption. Dip your brush into the primer and wipe excess off on the inner lip of its can. Apply a thin, even layer of primer with long, overlapping strokes.When you finish priming, the primer will likely look thin. You may be able to clearly see the original finish through the primer. This is completely natural.
With a solvent based primer, one layer should be enough to improve the finish of your paint. However, for best results, use two or three thin layers of primer. Allow the primer to dry and lightly sand it between applications., Wait the time indicated on your primer usage instructions until the primer is dry. When sanding primer, use gentle pressure with your fine-grit sandpaper. When you are finished, the surface should be silky to the touch. Wipe dust from sanding away with a clean rag.The primer may lighten in color when sanding, but should still be visible. Using too much force with your sandpaper will strip the primer away. In this case, you’ll have to replace the stripped layer of primer.
Sanding will smooth the outer layer of the primer. This will help subsequent layers that will be added later to adhere to the initial primer layer smoothly., In the fashion previously described, continue to prime your MDF until it has three coats total. Alternate between priming and sanding. Remember to wipe down the MDF with a clean rag after sanding. Multiple thin layers of primer will form a stronger, more professional looking finish than one thick layer or several thick layers., Open your paint and prepare it according to its instructions. In most cases, this will involve stirring the paint. Once open, dip your paintbrush into the can. Wipe excess paint on the inner lip of the can. Use long, overlapping strokes to apply the paint to the MDF.If using a roller to apply paint to your MDF, use one with low nap. “Nap” refers to the fuzziness of the roller.For the best looking and most resilient finish, use two to three thin layers of paint. In between applications, allow the paint to dry completely according to its usage directions., A paint that is oil-, alcohol-, or lacquer based can be used in place of one that is water based. After primer has been suitably applied, both water and solvent bases should adhere to the surface. Apply the paint in the fashion previously described for water based paint.

, Your paint should list a recommended drying time in its label instructions. A single layer of paint may be enough to satisfactorily coat your MDF.


Although one coat may be sufficient, two to three thin coats will create a stronger, more polished finish. Allow the paint to dry completely between applications."

Know the symptoms associated with ADHD.,
Decide whether your symptoms are really severe enough for prescription medication.,
Make an appointment with a psychiatrist.,
Discuss your concerns with your doctor.,
Start off on the lowest possible dose.,
Keep it to yourself.,
Don't take more than the recommended dose.",How to Get an Adderall Prescription," Before making an appointment with your doctor, ask yourself whether you experience any of the following symptoms on a regular basis:


Inability to notice small details.Being easily distracted from the task at hand by unrelated stimuli (noises, smells, people, etc).Inability to focus on tasks long enough to complete them.Frequently moving from one incomplete task to the next.Chronic procrastination.Disorganization and forgetfulness.Difficulty in social situations; specifically, an inability to stay on one topic at a time or stay focused while others speak.Excessive fidgeting, especially when seated.Impatience.Constantly interrupting others.;
, We all have trouble paying attention from time to time, especially when we are forced to focus on dull or uninteresting tasks for an extended period of time. Students, for example, are prone to seek out Adderall and other stimulants to help them complete their assignments even though they don't necessarily have ADHD. Keep in mind that that it is totally natural to have your mind wander off, and that there are other ways to improve your performance at work or school without medication.


In some cases, regular exercise may help you focus enough that you do not need medication.
The difference between somebody who wants medication and somebody who needs medication is that the latter's symptoms are so severe that they actually interrupt his or her ability to function properly in society. Keeping this difference in mind, use your best judgment to determine the severity of your symptoms.

, Psychiatrists are mental health professionals who have the ability to prescribe medication. Keep in mind that psychologists cannot prescribe medication.If you need recommendations for a good psychiatrist, ask your current healthcare provider to give you some references.
You may want to meet with a few different psychiatrists before settling on one that you feel comfortable with.

, During your first session, your doctor will ask you why you scheduled the appointment. Tell him or her about your symptoms, how often they occur, and how long you have noticed them. He or she will then ask several follow up questions to help make a diagnosis.


A few key points that your doctor is looking for are that you have always experienced these symptoms (because it is widely believed that people are born with ADHD),and that your symptoms are extreme enough to be detrimental to your well-being.
Be honest and thorough. It is important to be completely open with your doctor so that you can receive the best treatment possible.
Be upfront about wanting medication. Doctors know that not all patients are interested in medication, so it is important to let him or her know that you are open to medication as opposed to other treatment options.






Don't name the medication that you want. This will make it seem like you are trying to diagnose yourself, which is the doctor's job. Instead, tell him or her that your symptoms are so extreme that you feel medication is the only treatment option. Again, only say this if it's true.

, The dosage is something that you and your doctor will discuss together, and he or she may present you with different options for starting off. Because Adderall is habit-forming, it's best to start off on the lowest possible dosage to gauge your sensitivity to the drug.


The lower the dose you take, the less harmful the potential side-effects of the drug will be.

, Adderall and Ritalin are among the most commonly abused prescription drugs, especially among students.Remember that you were prescribed this medicine for a reason, and that giving it or selling it to others is unethical and may put their health at serious risk.

, Always take medicine as directed by your doctor. If you think that the dosage isn't strong enough, discuss this with your doctor rather than taking more than directed.

Create a balanced diet with a nutritionist.,
Remember that trying gaining weight doesn't mean you can eat unhealthy.,
Try eating before you take your medication.,
Eat foods high in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids.,
Consume foods high in zinc, magnesium, and vitamin B6.,
Maintain a daily workout routine.,
Ask your doctor about omega-3 and omega-6 supplements.,
Speak to your doctor about an appetite enhancing medication like Cyproheptadine.,
Talk to your doctor about using an antidepressant, like Remeron.,
Talk about adjusting your ADHD medication.",How to Gain Weight While on ADHD Medication," Before you make any changes to your diet, you should speak to a licensed dietician. Your doctor can refer you to a dietician, who can help you create a healthy, balanced diet that is customized to your dietary needs. Men need around 2,500 calories a day to maintain a healthy weight, and women need to consume around 2,000 calories a day.However, your daily calorie intake depends on your age, your metabolism, and your level of physical activity. Your ADHD medication will also be a factor, and your nutritionist may suggest a higher daily calorie intake to help you gain weight while on your medication, possibly starting with an additional 500 calories a day.To gain weight, you will need to eat more calories than your body burns every day through daily activity and daily exercise. It’s important that you gain weight safely by committing to a balanced diet with higher calorie meals every day. Your nutritionist can help you develop a meal plan so you are eating healthy, nutrient rich meals that will allow you to gain weight and maintain a healthy weight.;
, It may be tempting to reach for those donuts and ice cream — after all, you're trying to gain weight! But it's just as important to pay attention to where your calories come from when you are trying to gain weight as it is when you are trying to lose weight. Foods with empty calories (like sweets) will not give you the nutrition your brain and body need to function well. Instead, try adding calories in healthy ways, like with high-calorie, nutrient-rich smoothies with protein powders.Foods that are associated with quick weight gain, including sugary foods and drinks like soda, candy, cookies, pastries, etc., may also exacerbate symptoms of ADHD, especially hyperactivity., If you know you lose your appetite soon after taking your ADHD medication, make a habit of eating a healthy, hearty meal beforehand. So, if you usually wake up and immediately take your meds, hold off until you can have a healthy, filling breakfast (include whole grains, lots of protein, and try full-fat dairy). If you can, be flexible with your meal schedule and eat snacks, like protein bars, throughout the day., Your body needs fatty acids to fuel basic cell functioning, improve your body's overall immunity and enhance your heart functions. Studies have shown that a deficiency of omega-3 and omega-6 fats may contribute to the symptoms of ADHD, as these fatty acids also perform several functions in the brain, from transmitting dopamine and serotonin to helping your brain cells to communicate. Individuals with ADHD may then suffer from low levels of essential fatty acids.Your body cannot produce essential fatty acids on its own, so you need to add foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids into your diet. This includes having foods like salmon, tuna, and other cold-water fish. Omega-6 fatty acids can be consumed via vegetable oils.
Children with ADHD should have 12 ounces (per two meals) a week of fish and shellfish that are low in mercury, for example, shrimp, canned light tuna, pollack, salmon, cooked in unsaturated vegetable based fats.

, If you have ADHD, you may have deficiencies of vitamins and minerals like zinc, iron, magnesium, and vitamin B6. Megadoses of vitamin supplements can be toxic, so try to get these nutrients by maintaining a diet that is high in these essential vitamins.Work with your dietician or nutritionist to ensure you are eating lots of fruits and vegetables, particularly leafy green vegetables like spinach, as well as dairy and grains like brown rice and wholegrain bread.The average woman needs about 4.0–7.0 mg of zinc a day, and the average man needs 5.5–9.5mg of zinc a day. As well, men need 300mg of magnesium a day and women need 270mg of magnesium a day., Your nutritionist may also recommend that you maintain a daily workout routine along with your new meal plan so your body is able to burn off just enough calories to sustain a healthy weight. This means you may need to skip intense interval training or doing lots of cardio. Instead, focus on exercise that will help build muscle, such as strength training.Up keeping a mild to moderate workout routine, coupled with a high daily calorie intake, will allow you to gain weight in a healthy way.

, Recent studies have suggested that omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids supplements can help you get the nutrients you may be lacking due to a lack of appetite while on your ADHD medication. Always talk to your doctor before taking any supplements as they can react negatively with your medication.Supplements are not regulated by the FDA, meaning there is no standard for the purity of the ingredients or their safety. Your pharmacist or dietician can recommend a reputable brand and give you advice on what is an appropriate dose for you to take., Cyproheptadine is an antihistamine that can be taken to help enhance your appetite while on your ADHD medication.Cyproheptadine has been shown in studies to increase appetite and improve sleep patterns while on ADHD medication.However, always talk to your doctor before taking any other medications in conjunction with your ADHD medication.

, Some individuals have found that taking a mild antidepressant, like Remeron, can help to stimulate appetite when combines with ADHD medication. However, be aware of the side effects of antidepressants, which range from mild effects like shaking and dizziness to mood changes and a loss of coordination.For children who are taking ADHD medication, there is a concern that using antidepressants at such a young age can lead to severe mood swings and suicidal thoughts. Your doctor can outline all the possible risks of taking an antidepressant along with your ADHD medication.

, If you are struggling to gain weight, talk to your doctor. It may be necessary to adjust your medication (perhaps to a long-lasting dose or breaking up your medication throughout the day), or you may need to try a different medication altogether.


Never stop taking medication without speaking with your doctor first.

Make an appointment with a doctor.,
Ask your doctor to call a pharmacy to order your medicine.,
Ask your doctor if he belongs to a computer network.,
Find out if your health coverage will pay for the prescribed medicine.,
Go to a pharmacy close to your home.,
Interact with the pharmacist.,
Get your prescription medication mailed to you.,
Use an internet-based pharmacy with caution.",How to Fill a Prescription," If you have a chronic condition (such as diabetes) or are feeling symptoms related to something more acute (coughing, fever, joint pain, vomiting) then see your doctor for a physical. Once your doctor has diagnosed you, she may recommend a prescription medication to combat your symptoms. If so, she will give you a slip of paper (the script) that includes your name, the medicine and the amount (dosage) she wants you to take.


Your doctor should ask if you're taking any other medications or dietary supplements (vitamins, minerals, herbs) in order to avoid potentially harmful reactions. If she doesn't ask, make sure to volunteer such information.
Health professionals other than your doctor can give you a prescription. Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, dentists, podiatrists, psychiatrists, optometrists, naturopaths, osteopaths, veterinarian and even some chiropractors (in some areas) can give prescriptions for a limited number of medications.Note that the laws regarding what they can actually prescribe vary widely by state.;
, Some doctors and other health providers will call (or email) a nearby or conveniently located pharmacy to inform them of what medication you need.This procedure helps to eliminate confusion and errors of filling a prescription due to poor reading skills or misinterpreting poor handwriting. You'll still have a physical script from your doctor in most cases, but the pharmacy will already have your medication waiting for you when you arrive to pick it up.


Not all doctors or health care professionals offer this type of service because it's time consuming and dependent on the cooperation and efficiency of participating pharmacies. However, it never hurts to ask — it may save you some time and prevent mistakes.
Recent research indicates that about 1/3 of people who get a prescription from a health care provider for the first time don't get it filled.Reasons why may include misunderstandings, mistrust and/or differing opinions on the safety of prescription drugs.

, A growing number of health professionals belong to computer networks (that includes pharmacies) which share access to the provider’s electronic medical record (EMR).As part of this network, a pharmacist can see your health records from a computer and learn what other drugs you're taking. This type of network reduces communication errors and allows pharmacists to avoid potential drug side effects.


Any computer network that shares private and confidential information has a potential for abuse. Ask your doctor about the security of your health information in such networks before deciding to participate. You will sign a release before anything is automatically shared through this network.
With the advent of electronic health records and online prescribing, doctors can easily find out if you've filled your prescription or not.
Your doctor may also be able to send e-prescriptions directly to pharmacy of your choice through most electronic medical record systems.

, Before you get your prescription filled, you should find out if your health insurance plan will cover the costs of the medication(s), either entirely or partially.Be aware that certain types or brands of medication may not be covered by your plan, so you will be responsible for the cost out-of-pocket. If your insurance doesn't cover a particular drug it's okay to ask the doctor for a generic or a substitute medication.


You may be required to make a co-payment at the pharmacy. The pharmacy won't get reimbursed from insurer for a few weeks, so they ask for co-pay so that they can have some cashflow coming into the business.
Patients most likely not to get a prescription filled include: middle-aged and younger adults, patients not covered by health insurance, and those prescribed expensive drugs.In contrast, elderly patients with longstanding relationships with their doctor are most likely to fill and take their prescriptions.

, Once you have a script from your doctor or they have called/emailed it in, go to a convenient pharmacy and talk to the pharmacist there. Many pharmacies are located inside of grocery stores or large chain stores. It's best to fill all prescriptions with the same pharmacy because they'll keep a record of all the medicines you're taking, which helps to prevent drug interactions.Keep in mind your health insurance provider may require you to use certain pharmacies, otherwise you won't be reimbursed.


To find a pharmacy that accepts your health coverage, call the number on the back of your insurance card and talk to a representative or call the pharmacy directly and ask if they are contracted with your insurance plan.
To help the pharmacist fill your prescription, make sure all the information is filled out correctly and have your personal identification and health insurance card with you to show.

, The pharmacist or pharmacy employee is responsible for completing and filling your prescription.As such, the pharmacist may ask you for any missing information not written on the script, such as your name and address. Pharmacists are also required to screen your medication record (called a drug utilization review or DUR) prior to filling the script to avoid giving you drugs that interact with each other negatively.


In order to perform a DUR, the pharmacist must clarify your gender, age, known allergies, previous drug reactions, chronic conditions and the names of all the drugs you're taking.
Remember the drug name your doctor prescribes to you and for what reason, so you can confirm that information with the pharmacist before you start taking the medication. Mistakes happen, so it's best to be proactive and make sure things are clear.

, Many pharmacies now offer home delivery in order to make it more convenient. Furthermore, some health insurance companies choose to use mail-order pharmacies, particularly for chronic problems that require medication use over long periods of time (such as diabetes and hypertension).This ensures the patient gets their medication(s) on a regular basis and eliminates forgetfulness — which can be a significant factor with the elderly. Prior to receiving your medication, the prescription must be phoned or emailed in by your doctor to a pharmacy that offers the mail-order service.


As an added bonus, your prescription medication may cost less if you get it delivered to your home due to a lack of storage fees. On the other hand, the medication may take a week or more to arrive.
Because of the time delay, it's best to use mail-order services for chronic or less serious conditions, and not acute problems with significant symptoms needing quick attention.
Drugs that need to be maintained at specific temperatures should not be mail ordered. Pick them up from the local pharmacy instead.

, Internet pharmacies are becoming popular and are typically not affiliated with any of your local pharmacies. They market their medications online and only offer home delivery — you can't physically go to them with a script and get your prescription filled. Internet pharmacies usually have the lowest prices and offer a wide-variety of generic drugs, which often attracts people without full-coverage health plans who want to save money. Internet pharmacies can be a good option for notoriously expensive drugs, long-term medicines and medical supplies.Reputable internet pharmacies require that you have a prescription from your doctor before they sell you any medication. Their sites have instructions of how to transfer or prove your prescription.
Avoid any website that claims they can send you a controlled drug without a doctor's prescription — it's illegal and you could get in trouble.
The drug distribution centers that internet pharmacies use are often outside of the United States, so it may take more time to receive your medication(s).

Ask about over-the-counter medications.,
Start with a weaker opioid.,
Move up to a stronger opioid if necessary.,
Ask about antiseizure medications.,
Talk to your doctor about antidepressants.",How to Manage Multiple Myeloma Pain1," Over-the-counter pain medications can help you deal with the pain; however, it's very important to ask your doctor before starting one, as they can interfere with your treatment. You may be able to take ibuprofen, acetaminophen, or aspirin, for instance,but NSAIDs like ibuprofen do interfere with some cancer treatments.Chronic use of NSAIDS can also lead to gastric ulcers.;
, When it comes to pain management, it's best to take only what you need to manage the pain. Therefore, try starting with a weaker opioid, such as codeine in combination with acetaminophen, to help you manage your pain from multiple myeloma.Talk to your doctor for a prescription. Most doctors are more than willing to prescribe pain medications for cancer patients.

, If the opioid you are on isn't strong enough for you, you may need to try a stronger type of opioid. Alternatively, you may just need to try a different kind of opioid, as not everyone responds to the same painkillers. Some stronger opioids your doctor might put you on include methadone, oxycodone, morphine, or oxymorphone., In some cases, antiseizure medications can help with your pain. Usually, these medications are most helpful if your pain is mainly the result of nerve damage. Ask your doctor if this type of medication is an option for you., Another option that can be helpful for pain from nerve damage is an antidepressant. In some people, taking an antidepressant decreases the chances of a pain signal reaching the brain, decreasing your pain overall."

Take pain medications orally.,
Use a patch.,
Try rectal medications.,
Consider taking meds intravenously.",How to Manage Multiple Myeloma Pain2," The simplest way to take pain medications is by mouth. You've likely taken medications this way in the past, swallowing the medication with a glass of water. In this form, medications come in tablets, gel caps, and other swallowable forms, as well as dissolvable forms, that you let dissolve in your mouth.If you have trouble with swallowing pills, you may need to take pain medications in other forms or stick to the dissolving kind.
Usually, you take these medications as needed, though some come in a sustained-release form, so the medication is released gradually and may relieve your pain for longer periods of time.
If you don't like taking pills but you still prefer an oral application, you can also get pain medications in lollipop form., Another option for pain management is a patch. You leave the patch on your skin, and it delivers pain medication to your body. It provides a steady dose, meaning you don't have a break between medications as long as you apply a new patch on time. Generally, you apply these patches every couple of days.Fentanyl is one such drug. It lasts for two to three days days of and provides very strong and effective relief.

, You can also take pain medications rectally. You'll insert a small suppository in your rectum that will deliver the pain medication to your body. You generally take this type of medication as needed. Morphine is sometimes taken in this form., If you can't take pain medications by mouth, another option is taking them intravenously. For this type of delivery method, you'll need to have a semi-permanent IV line in your hand or arm where medications can be injected easily. IV administration of opioid medication is usually reserved for patients in the hospital or on hospice.You may also get a pump that you always have with you that continually gives you drugs intravenously."

Talk to your doctor about nerve blocks.,
Ask about radiation treatment.,
Consider surgery.,
Use braces to support your bones.",How to Manage Multiple Myeloma Pain3," This option is one available to many cancer patients. Basically, your doctor will give you an injection of anesthetic at the site of the pain, which helps keep the pain signal from reaching your brain.You may need more than one injection before you feel the effects of this intervention.


If you have a fear of needles, this therapy may not be for you. However, most people find that their fear of the injection is worse than the actuality, as the doctor will usually numb the area first. The procedure generally lasts five to 15 minutes. You may be a bit sore for a few days.This procedure is generally safe, though you may have low blood pressure for a couple of days.
Your doctor may use analgesics, alcohol, or steroid injections to help reduce the pain., One option to decrease pain is to use radiation on your tumors. The radiation helps to decrease the size of the tumor. In turn, the tumor is less likely to push on the nerves that cause you pain.Radiation can also help with pain caused by bone lesions, where your bones are weak.
Usually, external radiation is used for multiple myeloma. The radiation comes from a machine outside your body, and it is aimed at your tumors to help reduce them. It's much like having an x-ray done.
This treatment does come with side effects, such as diarrhea, fatigue, skin problems, and low blood counts., Surgery can also reduce your pain. One way it can help is to reduce the tumor size or remove it altogether, making it less likely that it will push on nerves. In addition, surgery can be used to support fragile or fractured bones, decreasing pain at these sites.Also, your doctor can use a more minor surgery to snip the ends of nerves, reducing pain., Because myeloma can make your bones fragile, braces can help provide support, which in turn can decrease your pain. Try wearing a neck or back brace if you're having pain in those areas.You can buy braces at drug stores and medical supply stores.

Consider acupuncture.,
Try relaxation or meditation techniques.,
Ask about massages.,
Perform light exercises.",How to Manage Multiple Myeloma Pain4," While acupuncture isn't for everyone, some people find it does help. Acupuncture is the process of putting small needles into certain pressure points across your body in an effort to reduce pain. Ask your doctor if this is a good idea for you, as well as for a recommendation for a local acupuncturist., One way that people manage their pain is through the use of relaxation techniques. These techniques have been shown to improve pain over time, and they may even boost your immune system.Try some techniques on your own. For instance, you can try simple deep breathing. When the pain is bad, try closing your eyes. Focus only on your breathing. Breathe in for four counts through your nose. Hold it for four counts, then blow it out for four counts. Keep breathing to calm yourself, and try to work through the pain.
You can also try to find a meditation center or class in your city. You can take a class or join a group so that you can learn new meditation techniques.

, Some people with multiple myeloma have some luck easing the pain with massages. While this option may be a good one for you, you should talk to your doctor first, as this treatment may not be right for everyone, particularly if your bones are already becoming brittle in some areas., Light exercising can help strengthen your bones over time, which multiple myeloma works to weaken. When your bones weaken, you're more susceptible to fractures and pain. Try exercises like walking or doing yoga or T'ai Chi.Always talk to your doctor before starting an exercise regimen, particularly if you have a serious health problem.

Do not take too much.",How to Dose Ranitidine," Ranitidine may be used to manage a duodenal ulcer, a type of peptic ulcer in the small intestine, as well as gastric ulcers. An adult may take 150 mg twice a day or 300 mg once a day to help manage symptoms. Additionally, you can take 150 mg once a day to help prevent symptoms.For children under 16, it is recommended that you do not exceed 300 mg per day for treatment, and no more than 150 mg per day for symptom management.Treatment is typically administered for eight weeks but may be necessary for up to a year. Consult with your doctor to determine proper treatment time frame.;
, Ranitidine can help counteract and prevent symptoms of indigestion. To prevent symptoms, adults should take 75 to 150 mg with a glass of water half an hour before eating. To treat symptoms, take the same dose no more than twice a day.Children over the age of 12 may safely receive up to two doses of 75 mg with a glass of water per day. Other remedies should be sought for younger children., Ranitidine may be used to treat erosive esophagitis symptoms. Adults are recommended to take 150 mg four times a day to treat symptoms, and 150 mg twice a day for maintenance. Talk to your doctor to discuss how long you may need to continue treatment.For children under 16, it is recommended that you provide no more than 5 to 10 mg/kg per day, divided over two doses. Look for a children’s formula if available at your local pharmacy or drugstore., A number of disorders, including hypergastrinemia and hyperhistaminemia, comprise the umbrella term “gastric acid hypersecretory.” 150 mg taken twice daily can help control symptoms for most of these conditions in most adults. The same dose is also useful for acid reflux and GERDS.For children under 16, the recommended dose is 5 to 10 mg/kg per day, divided over two doses. Look for a children’s formula if available to help you administer the proper dose., Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome is a rare pancreatic condition. 150 mg of ranitidine taken twice a day may help treat some symptoms in adults. However, due to the rare nature of this condition, it is highly recommended that anyone talk with their doctor first before starting any form of treatment, including using over the counter medications., Over the counter ranitidine is commonly available in 75 mg and 150 mg tablets. If you have spoken with your doctor or otherwise know based on past experience that 150 mg is the right dose for you, opt for that. Otherwise, talk to your doctor or start with the 75 mg tablets. You can always a second tablet if 75 mg is not enough., The brand-name version of ranitidine, Zantac, is available in a syrup form. Zantac syrup has been found to be especially helpful for heartburn and acid reflux. A syrup may also be easier to properly measure and administer to children, especially kids who haven’t learned to swallow tablets yet., For severe or chronic conditions, your doctor may be able to prescribe you a higher ranitidine dosage than you can buy over the counter. Talk to your doctor about your symptoms and what you’ve done to try and manage your symptoms so that they can help determine if you need a prescription-strength medication., You won’t need to provide ranitidine injections for yourself, but the medication can be administered either through intramuscular injection (IM) or intravenous drip (IV). If you have a severe or chronic condition, talk to your doctor about if and when you might need ranitidine injections., Package directions for ranitidine tablets generally recommend that the medication be taken with water. Some prescription strength tablets may even be dissolved or mixed into water. Check your prescription packaging for details., Doctors and nurses typically suggest that ranitidine should be taken around meal time. If you are taking it to prevent a condition that is brought on by food, such as heartburn, it’s best to take the medication half an hour to an hour before eating. Otherwise, taking the medication with or right after the meal is just fine., What qualifies as too much depends on your health and your condition, so talk to your doctor about your maximum daily dosage. Unless otherwise expressly instructed by your doctor, don’t exceed the maximum daily recommended amount indicated on the package.While many users experience no side-effects, ranitidine has been known to cause headaches, dizziness, sleep problems, nausea, stomach pain, diarrhea, and constipation. Talk to your doctor if taking ranitidine brings on any of these symptoms."

Choose a creatine powder.,
Decide whether to ""load"" or base your dosage on your body weight.,
Take creatine at the same time every day.",How to Drink Creatine1," Creatine powder usually comes in a large plastic container with a scoop inside for measuring out the correct dosage. Go to a nutrition store or health food store and select a powder to use.


Some creatine comes in pure form, and other powders are mixed with sugar so you can create a sweet energy drink.
Avoid liquid creatine. Creatine begins degrading the moment it is mixed with water, so packaged liquid creatine is actually creatine waste. Manufacturers of such products are pulling a fast one on consumers.
Creatine has been tested in multiple studies and is considered safe to use, but since it is a supplement, it has not been formally approved by the FDA. Check with your doctor if you're taking medication or have a condition that might be affected by taking a supplement.;
, Creatine manufacturers recommend starting out with a high dosage of creatine and gradually waning to a ""maintenance"" dose to maintain creatine levels in your body. It is also common to forego the loading period and base your dosage on body weight.


Loading is said to be safe for the body and help the consumer see results - bigger, stronger muscles - in just a few days.
Creatine may affect insulin levels, so if you have a condition related to high or low blood sugar, use caution when taking high doses. You may want to consider the more moderate body weight-based method., It doesn't matter when you take your creatine; whether you consume it in the morning or at night, it will have the same effect on your body. However, for best results, consume it at the same time each day so that your body has time to process one dose before you consume the next one.


Some people like to take creatine right before a workout, but its effects aren't instant, so it doesn't actually provide an immediate energy boost for weight-lifting and other exercises.
If you want to take creatine on the go, bring a separate water bottle and store the creatine dry. If you premix it, the creatine will degrade.

"
"
Measure out 5 grams of creatine powder.,
Mix the powder with one quart of water.,
Drink the creatine immediately.,
Take 4 doses a day for the first 5 days.,
Taper off to 2 or 3 doses a day.",How to Drink Creatine2," When you're loading creatine, 5 grams is the recommended dosage to start with; unless a doctor has recommended otherwise, 5 grams is a safe bet.


Use the plastic measuring cup that came with the powder to measure it out.
If your can of powder didn't come with a measuring tool, measure one heaping teaspoon, which is roughly equivalent to 5 grams.

, Pour the powder directly into the water and use a spoon to quickly stir it. If you're using a bottle with a cap, you can close the cap and shake it.


If you don't have a container that is exactly quart-sized, measure four cups of water into a large container and mix in the powder.
You may find it convenient to buy a quart-sized water bottle with a lid, which you can carry with you for times when you want to take a dose of creatine outside the house.
You can also mix creatine with juice or an electrolyte-containing energy drink.

, As mentioned above, creatine beings to degrade when it is mixed with water, so you must consume it right away to get the maximum benefit from the supplement.


Chase the creatine with more water. It's important to stay well hydrated while you take creatine, so follow it up with another cup or two.
Eat and drink as normal. There are no dietary contraindications for creatine, so you may eat a normal meal before or after consuming it.

, When you're loading creatine, you need a total of 20 grams a day for the first five days. Space out the doses so you have one at breakfast, one at lunch, one at dinner and one before bed.

, After the initial 5-day load, taper off to a comfortable maintenance routine. You can safely take up to 4 doses a day, but taking 2 or 3 has the same effect once you're in maintenance mode. Since creatine isn't cheap, you might want to cut back the dosage.

"
"
Calculate your dosage for the first week.,
Calculate your dosage for the second week.",How to Drink Creatine3," During the initial stage, your dose should be .35 g of creatine per kg of body weight. Divide the total number per day into easily consumable amounts.


For example, if you weigh 68 kg (150 pounds), multiply that by .35 to find that your daily dosage should be 23.8 g. That means you should take just under 6 grams of creatine per dose, 4 times per day.

, During the second week, taper off to a dosage of .15 g of creatine per kg of body weight. This time, divide the total dose into 2 or 3 easily consumable amounts.


If you weigh 68 kg (150 pounds), multiply that by .15 to find that your your daily dosage should be 10.2 grams of creatine per day. You can divide that into two doses of 5.1 grams, or divide it into three doses of 3.4 grams. Choose the option that's most convenient for your lifestyle.

Consider your diet.,
Think about your age.,
Make sure your vitamin has USP verification.,
Make sure a multivitamin has what you need.,
Don't forget micronutrients.,
Eat a healthy diet.",How to Decide If Multivitamins Are Right for You1," Many people who are on restricted diets may benefit from taking multivitamins. For example, if you are trying to lose weight, you may eat less and therefore not be taking in as many nutrients as you should. Vegetarians and vegans (people who don't eat meat and people who don't consume animal-based products) may need supplements to receive their daily minimum requirements.If you eat fewer than five servings of fruits and vegetables per day, you may want to consider taking multivitamins.
If you are a vegan and consume no animal products, it is important you take vitamin B12, which is only available in animal foods like meat, dairy, fish, eggs, etc. You can also look for plant products fortified with B12 — just make sure you're getting it somehow, or you risk anemia or neurological problems, such as difficulty concentrating.If you have gained or lost more than 10 pounds in the previous six months without trying to, you may benefit from taking multivitamin supplements.;
, Your vitamin needs vary according to your lifespan. Older men and women are less able to absorb certain vitamins from natural food sources, such as vitamin B-12, and will require supplements. Women of child-bearing years may require additional iron and Vitamin C., The U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention (USP)is a nonprofit agency that verifies whether a supplement contains the ingredients it claims on its label. Look for the seal associated with the USP verification — don't be fooled by finding the letters USP on the label of your vitamins.If your vitamins aren't certified by the USP, they may be worthless. Or, they may be actively harmful. In a manufacturing error, the amount of vitamin D found in a non-certified supplement varied from nine to 146 percent of what was listed on the bottle. There was even inconsistency from pill to pill within the same bottle.Consumer Lab is a newer agency that provides verification services for multivitamins. Look for its label, CL.

, The contents of a multivitamin vary. You'll want to consider your own dietary needs to make sure you're taking the best multivitamin for you. If you're an older adult, you'll need more calcium, vitamin D, and B6. If you're a premenopausal woman, you'll need more iron.Consult a dietitian or your family doctor to ensure you're getting the right vitamin balance for your health needs.

, Micronutrients are vitamins and minerals that are required, but in small amounts. They include iron, iodine, vitamin A, folate and zinc. Your body can't produce micronutrients; they must be taken in through food and vitamin supplements. Good multivitamins should include a range of micronutrients.Certain micronutrients are necessary for healthy fetal development. All women of child-bearing age who are planning to get pregnant are recommended to take folate supplements as soon as they start trying.Talk to your medical provider about folate, iron and folic acid supplements.
Multivitamins may contain other ingredients for which there are no FDA standard guidelines. Talk to your doctor before purchasing these multivitamins.

, Your daily vitamins can be best absorbed when found in your daily food intake. Before taking a multivitamin, consider your daily food intake. Make sure you're eating 5 portions of fruit and vegetable per day.Get plenty of fiber by including beans and legumes; nuts and seeds; oats and whole grains; and unprocessed fruits and vegetables.
Increase the amount of by potassium you take in by including the following within your daily diet: beans and legumes; potatoes; low-fat milk and yogurt; lower-sodium canned tomato products; fruits; and lamb, pork, and fish.
Include high-calcium foods in your diet, such as milk, cheese, and yogurt; calcium-fortified, plant-based milks; orange juice; cereals; tofu (prepared with calcium citrate); and almonds.

Ask your pediatrician about multivitamins.,
Recognize when a multivitamin may help.,
Realize that children's vitamins are unregulated.",How to Decide If Multivitamins Are Right for You2," Most children will not need a multivitamin, and the dangers of taking in too much of a vitamin can outweigh the potential benefits. Many foods are fortified with essential nutrients, such as B vitamins, vitamin D, calcium and iron. In short, your child may already be getting enough nutrition, even if it seems like he's a pretty picky eater.Foods are the best source of vitamins and minerals for children as well as adults.
Make sure your child has access to a varied, healthy diet for meals and snacks.

, If your child has physical and developmental delay (i.e. failure to thrive) she may benefit from a multivitamin. Some children are allergic to milk, or have food sensitivities that result in an overly restricted diet.Heartburn, reflux or vomiting can cause a child to have difficulty consuming a healthy dose of vitamins. A multivitamin will help provide her with proper nutritional requirement.
Children with gastro-intestinal problems may also benefit from a multivitamin.
Talk to your pediatrician before starting your child on multivitamins.

, The major brands of children's vitamins do not submit to the voluntary process of USP or CL verification, relying instead upon brand identification for consumer's trust. This means that there is not an independent firm checking for quality control, ensuring that the vitamins contain what the label claims.In order to encourage the child to willingly take his vitamins, children's vitamins often taste more like candy than medicine. This encourages over-consumption, which can be dangerous. Make sure you keep your child's vitamins out of reach.
Children's vitamins also contain additives and sweeteners, which don't benefit your child's overall health.

Realize the hazards of vitamin mega-doses.,
Know that long-term use of multivitamins may not be healthy.,
Be aware of fortified foods.,
Consider the bias of labeling.",How to Decide If Multivitamins Are Right for You3," Taking vitamin C in extremely high amounts was a popular — and false — remedy for colds for several years. Evidence shows no benefits to taking vitamin C in large doses, and that taking too much (2000 mg or more) may result in a greater chance of developing kidney stones.Researchers showed that smokers who took vitamin A supplements were more likely to develop lung cancer than smokers who didn't. For non-smokers too, taking in too much vitamin A can result in sickness and even death.
Vitamin E supplements have been connected with increased rates of cancer.
Be particularly careful with fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamins A, D, E, K. Vitamins that are water-soluble can be regulated by your body — you will just pee out the excess. Fat-soluble vitamins remain in your fat stores, and your body cannot remove excess amounts. There is a serious risk of toxicity from A, D, E, and K levels being too high. Make sure you follow the guidelines on the bottle or set by your doctor.

, Research suggests that people who use multivitamins over an extended period of time (over 25 years) may have increased risk of cancer and death.Older research on the use of multivitamins showed only minimal risk, but no clear benefits.Research showed an increase in the chances of being diagnosed with cancer for people taking supplements of vitamin D. No decrease in cancer diagnosis was found among those who took supplemental multivitamins, or other vitamin supplements., Most people will consume their daily requirements of vitamins and minerals from their food intake. Folic acid, for example, is added to so many food products that unless you are a pregnant woman, it's unlikely that you would need additional supplements. Yet folic acid is commonly included among the list of ingredient of a multivitamin. Your daily intake could easily rise to 1,000 mcg or more, potentially increasing the risk of colorectal and possibly prostate and breast cancers.People who consume poor-quality diets are more likely to rely on multivitamins for their health, though poor-quality American diets tend to contain many fortified foods.
Read the labels of your food when possible. Notice what percentage of a standard dietary requirement is found in each serving size.

, Many so-called ""natural"" vitamins are not natural. There is yet no legal definition for natural to which the makers of vitamins and supplements are forced to adhere. Because these vitamins sell for much more than their generic or synthetic alternatives, the manufacturers have a natural incentive to brand their vitamins falsely.Look for actual food sources in the vitamin. For example, if the label reads ""acerola cherry powder,"" which contains vitamin C, it's more likely a natural vitamin. If it reads simply ""vitamin C"" it's likely synthetic.
Learning to recognize common synthetic forms of vitamins, such as chloride, hydrochloride, acetate or nitrate will help you recognize natural vitamins.
Some nutritional experts state that natural vitamins are better for human health than synthetic; however, research has not borne this out.

Consider physical therapy.,
Look into assistive devices.,
Choose your medications wisely.,
Purchase epsom salt.,
Find a support group.,
Stay active.,
Watch your weight.,
Don’t forget to stretch.,
Consider the climate.",How to Manage Osteoarthritis Pain," Movement is one of the best ways to manage osteoarthritis pain and physical therapy can help to get you moving.Physical therapy teaches you how to move properly and is beneficial for anyone who is feeling stuck and unsure of how to move without causing additional pain.
Doing everyday activities without excessive difficulty, is one of the primary goals of physical therapy.If you are using assistive devices, physical therapy can also teach you how to use them properly.
Physical therapy may be the best option for you if you'd like someone to initially show you how to do exercises and increase movement. If you've recently begun using assistive devices, this may be another reason to choose physical therapy.;
, Increased function and mobility are some of the benefits of assistive devices, but they aren't necessary for everyone who has osteoarthritis.Devices include everything from scooters to walkers and splints and can be found at most pharmacies or large retail stores such as Walmart. For more specialized products such as custom braces, you will need to speak with your doctor in order to purchase them.
It's important to always consult your doctor before purchasing or using an assistive device. If not worn or used properly, such devices can do more harm than good.
Assistive devices may be a good option for you if your activities and movement have been limited by osteoarthritis. They can be used in correspondence with both physical therapy and medication.

, There are a wide variety of medications, which can be used to manage osteoarthritis pain. Options range from pills and syrups, to lotions and injectables.


Osteoarthritis medications typically fall into one of four categories:

Analgesics. These are pain relievers, which can be found over the counter. Acetaminophen, and opioids (narcotics) are two fairly common analgesics.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). While analgesics help with pain relief, NSAIDs help to manage inflammation. Aspirin and ibuprofen are two common NSAIDs and can be found over the counter.
Corticosteroids. These powerful anti-inflammatory medicines are either taken orally or, with a doctor's assistance, are injected directly into a joint.Hyaluronic acid. Another type of injection administered at a doctor’s office is hyaluronic acid, which acts as a shock absorber and lubricant.Always consult a doctor before using one of these treatments, even if it’s something that can be found over the counter.
You should choose medications based on the severity of your pain and how much it affects your day to day life. For example, mild to moderate pain may be treatable with an over the counter medicine, while severe pain may only be treatable with an injectable medicine.

, If you'd prefer to focus on in-home treatments, consider using bath salts. It has been determined that high levels of salt can be beneficial to managing inflammation associated with osteoarthritis.One of the biggest benefits to epsom salt is the lack of side effects.
To use epsom salt at home, you'll need to first purchase some from a local pharmacy. Read the instructions on the back for further details, but typically you need to dissolve about two cups of salt with warm water before adding it your bath. You can also soak a towel in the mixture and can wear it as a compress.
This may be the best course of treatment for those who prefer natural remedies to using medications.

, To learn more about osteoarthritis, consider joining a support group. You’ll not only have access to information, but will meet people who are in a similar situation.


One of the easiest ways to start taking control of your osteoarthritis is by getting involved in a support group.
There are many ways in which you can benefit from an osteoarthritis support group. From an educational standpoint, you’ll learn more about osteoarthritis. Physically, you’ll be encouraged to get moving and to stay active. Emotionally, members are less likely to be depressed and experience greater self-confidence., Although it may hurt to even think about it, staying active is crucial to managing osteoarthritis.


To help ease any burden on your joints and to reduce pain you should strengthen your muscles through frequent exercise.Go for a walk around the block or do some yard work. Remember that it’s important to stay active without overdoing it.
If high impact land exercises are too painful, consider swimming. Swimming helps to alleviate the stress on joints, which may be affected by osteoarthritis.Simple exercises you can do at home include:

Arm circles - Stretch your arms out to your sides. Keeping them straight, make small circles for as quickly and as long as you can.
Half squats - Start by standing up straight. Next, squat down about halfway between a standing position and a seated position with your legs at a 90-degree angle. Hold that position for 30 seconds or as long as you can manage., Maintaining a healthy diet is important to your overall health and your waistline.


Losing weight can play an important role in managing osteoarthritis pain, as excess weight adds stress to your joints and other affected areas.Some foods to stock up on include fish, which contains omega-3 fatty acids, as well as red and purple fruits such as cherries.When you’re cooking try substituting olive oil for butter. Olive oil is not only better for your heart, but contains anti-inflammatory properties.In general, substituting junk food with healthy alternatives (think cauliflower for mashed potatoes) will help you to improve your diet, while making it easier to keep the weight off.

, To help manage stiffness in your joints, don’t forget to include stretching in your daily routine. Slow, gentle movements are beneficial in improving flexibility and stiffness as well as reducing pain.Try a yoga or tai chi class. Tai chi focuses on slow movement, breathing and meditation, while yoga helps to ease pain through certain poses such as the downward facing dog.

To do the downward facing dog, start on your hands and knees, with your hands slightly in front of your shoulders. Pressing back, raise your knees away from the floor and lift your tailbone up toward the ceiling.


One of the stretches you may want to include in your daily routine is the cat stretch. This stretch is easy to do from home and will help to improve flexibility. Kneel with your arms on the floor in front of you shoulder width apart. Push your spine to the ceiling and hold, then push your spine down and lift your head.

, If you have the ability to relocate, you may want to consider moving to a warm, dry climate. Some people have found that living in a warmer climate helps to relieve symptoms associated with osteoarthritis.Before you make the choice to move, consider what you'll be leaving behind. Family support should be a factor in your decision, as should having to find a new doctor.
Know that even if you move to a warmer climate, there's no guarantee you'll experience less pain.
This may be an appropriate choice for you if you've recently retired and were already considering relocating to a warmer spot.

In some cases, crushing medication is simply not an option — it can cause the medication to work improperly can in fact be quite dangerous in some cases.Extended (sustained)-release medications should never be crushed. Crushing them can interfere with their release mechanism and cause administration of a large dose all at once.
Delayed (enteric-coated) medications should not be crushed. These drugs are coated with materials that are designed to protect the drug from stomach acids or to prevent the drug from irritation your stomach. Crushing them can alter this mechanism.;
, You may be able to identify medications that must not be crushed by looking at the drug's label. Spot certain prefixes or suffixes that may indicate the pill should not be crushed.Most common prefixes or suffixes for sustained-release, controlled-release, or controlled-delivery products include: 12-hour, 24-hour, CC, CD, CR, ER, LA, Retard, SA, Slo-, SR, XL, XR, or XT.
Prefixes for enteric-coated tablets include EN- and EC-.

, Many medications come in or can be prepared in other formulations such as in liquid or in an injectable formula. If crushing the medication is not an option, ask your doctor or pharmacist if this is the case with your medication.


Oral solutions may be commercially available so that you can drink your medications. If unavailable, consult your doctors or pharmacists whether a liquid formulation can be prepared.In some cases, an injectable formulation of the medication may be possible. Consult your doctors or pharmacists., Crushing your medication one dose at a time is ideal so that you don’t have to waste it or worry about it going bad. Also, avoid crushing different kinds of medication together, unless approved by a doctor or a pharmacist.

, There are multiple ways to crush the pills. None is superior or inferior to others.


Purchasing a pill crusher may be the easiest way for this task.A plastic Ziploc/sandwich bag along with a small hammer or a heavy cup. Make sure the plastic bag is dry and clean before use.
A small bowl or cup along with a sturdy spoon.
A mortar and a pestle.

, You can soak the pill in some water. This may soften the pill, making the pounding/grinding task a little easier.

, Make sure the medication can be taken with food or liquid other than water. Some medications interact with food or drink to cause food poisoning and/or other harmful effects.

, You don't want to contaminate your medication. This could potentially have a harmful effect.

, For this method, follow the manufacturer's instructions. Different types are available from different companies. Find out which one works best for your needs.

, Place your pill in a clean, dry plastic bag. Close the bag and lay it on a flat, hard surface.


Pound the pill once with a hammer or a heavy cup.
Shake the bag around. Make sure that larger parts of your pill can be crushed evenly.
Pound the pill again. Use less force this time. You may need to repeat this several times, before the pill is completely crushed.

, Place your pill in a clean, dry cup or mortar. Soak the pill in a small amount of water for five minutes. This is optional but may help soften the pill. Less pounding/grinding may be required too.


Pound the pill once with a spoon or a pestle, using great force. Make sure that the pill doesn't jump out of the container.
Scrape down the medication that may be stuck on the side.
Pound or grind the pill again. Use less force this time. You may need to repeat this several times, before the pill is completely crushed.

, With anything that will be reused, clean them well so that no residual drug will remain and react with medication to be crushed in the future. Again, contamination of the medication could potentially have a harmful effect.

, Some medications interact with certain food or drink, altering their effectiveness or even causing food-poisoning or more severe side effects. Consult with your doctor or pharmacist when unsure., If it is safe or appropriate to ingest with food or liquid other than water, mix the crushed pill with food or drink of your choice. It is best to consult with your doctor or pharmacist whether the medication should not be mixed with certain food or drink.


Food: Applesauce, pudding, peanut butter, etc.
Drinks: milk, chocolate milk, fruit juice, etc.

, It is crucial that you take one dose-portion of the medication, no more or no less. Drug dosage is calculated precisely, and you need to stick to it!


If you mix powder from one pill (one dose) with an entire container of applesauce, finish eating that entire container of applesauce.
If you crush two pills (two doses, one for the morning and the other for the evening) with one container of applesauce, eat half the container in the morning and finish the rest in the evening.

Research the safety of marijuana as a medical drug.,
Research the effectiveness of marijuana as a medical drug.,
Compare marijuana to alternative, approved drugs.,
Determine if marijuana can be prescribed in a safe and effective manner.,
Determine if marijuana can be distributed in a safe and effective manner.,
Determine the availability and cost of medical marijuana.",How to Evaluate Medical Marijuana," The primary concern relating to marijuana involves its safety. All medical drugs must be proven to be relatively safe. Marijuana use can result in an increased heart rate, which may in turn trigger a heart attack. THC can induce an altered state and may cause what has been referred to as acute psychosis. Some studies have also indicated that marijuana use may be associated with schizophrenia. However, marijuana may help to improve certain mental disorders. This is partially demonstrated by the fact that cannabidiol is an anti-psychotic. Scientific studies have also shown that cannabidiol is not psychoactive (won't get you high), and can at least partially counteract the negative psychoactive effects of THC. Cannabidiol is also relatively safe. Smoked marijuana may contribute to diseases of the lung, but has not been shown to be overly associated with lung cancer as cannabinoids may help to prevent cancer. Cannabis sativa can be bred to have very high levels of cannabidiol and very low levels of THC. As such, safer types of marijuana can be developed and distributed. The effective lethal dose of a drug is important, especially when evaluating the risk that is involved with taking various drugs. It is estimated that a minimal effective dose of unrefined smoked marijuana must be increased one million times to produce a lethal dose of unrefined smoked marijuana.;
, All medical drugs must be found to be effective, in addition to being safe. Marijuana is an effective drug because all people have cannabinoid receptors in their brain and throughout their body. Marijuana has been used with success as a drug to increase appetite for people who have debilitating diseases such as HIV, AIDS and cancer. Marijuana has also been used successfully to alleviate glaucoma and certain types of chronic pain. Cannabinoids are phenolic-like antioxidant compounds and have been shown to be neuroprotective (protect the brain against damage from alcohol and other toxic compounds as well as from trauma). One recent study conducted in part by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) states that cannabidiol is devoid of psychoactive effects, is anti-inflammatory, and is an antioxidant. The study also concluded that cannabidiol may help to improve the pathologies that are associated with diabetes and atherosclerosis (see source by Rajesh et al below). It is important to understand that while THC can cause a noticeable high and binds to cannabinoid receptors in the brain, other cannabinoids exert their effects by binding to receptors outside of the brain, and do not cause one to get high. These cannabinoids may be important for relieving pain and ameliorating or preventing various disease states.

, Synthetic THC is an approved prescription drug. Modern cannabis-based drugs that are available outside of the United States (such as Sativex) contain cannabidiol as well as THC. Sativex is a standardized extract made from marijuana plants, and may be a safer, more effective medical drug than pure synthetic THC. Sativex also contains other active cannabinoids and plant constituents. As there are over sixty different cannabinoids in marijuana (not just the cannabinoids THC and cannabidiol), the whole marijuana plant has a greater potential as a more useful, effective drug that can be used for a greater variety of conditions. Medical marijuana may have less debilitating side effects than some approved medical drugs. Opiate-based painkillers, over the counter analgesics, and many other drugs that may be taken instead of marijuana can all be fatal and damaging to the body if too much is taken. Also, various prescription drugs are highly addictive. Marijuana has been found to be habit-forming, but less so than many other medications and legal substances such as nicotine. It is also important to understand that marijuana is a non-standardized plant, while prescription drugs are completely standardized. As such, very specific doses of drugs such as synthetic THC can be administered, while the doses of marijuana must be estimated. In other words, the exact milligrams of THC and cannabidiol that are supplied by a dose of marijuana must be estimated. Also, the effects of the many other cannabinoids that exist in marijuana cannot be accurately predicted.

, Doctors prescribe medical marijuana. Doctors can actively monitor patients who use medical marijuana, and therefore help to ensure that the marijuana is used in a safe an effective manner. All medical drugs are approved for specific medical conditions. Approved medical drugs have also been thoroughly researched to determine the benefits and risks that are involved with their use. In the case that marijuana is an officially recognized medical drug, doctors as well as patients can be more assured that the marijuana that they prescribe conforms to specific standards. These standards help to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the marijuana. In the case that marijuana is not an officially recognized medical drug, doctors may not be able to prescribe marijuana with complete confidence that the marijuana will be safe or effective.

, Prescription drugs and over the counter drugs must be regulated in such a way that they are only distributed to the patients who need them. Drugs must not be easily obtained by people who are not authorized to use them. Some medical marijuana patients can legally grow their own marijuana in a controlled, regulated manner. Other medical marijuana patients obtain their marijuana from authorized as well as unauthorized dispensaries. Some countries and US states have considered implementing dispensaries as well as marijuana farms that are entirely controlled by local or national governments. This system would help to ensure that only approved medical marijuana patients receive medical marijuana. This type of system would also help to ensure that patients are actively monitored and receive correct dosages.

, Marijuana is a plant that grows readily in many different climates and geographical locales. Marijuana can also be grown indoors. This makes marijuana affordable and readily available to all people. Essentially all other medical drugs must be manufactured in factories and distributed by pharmacists. Other medical drugs may also be quite expensive.

, Transitioning in this way can make transgender people feel happier and more at home in their own bodies; however, if you are unhappy with or uncomfortable with feeling out of sync with your gender, you might have a hormonal imbalance that could be adjusted with testosterone. In either case, talk to a doctor to see if testosterone treatment is right for you.

, Trans men have higher-than-average risk of being murdered, bullied, or sexually harassed.If you're transitioning, you might experience hostility in public, in private, or at work. Some people might not accept you when you transition.


If you do not think you will be safe and comfortable after beginning hormone replacement therapy, you may want to consider finding different living arrangements and/or different employment options, or you may want to delay transitioning until you are in a more secure situation.
Although beginning testosterone can be an exciting milestone, many of the initial changes and side effects are highly visible and irreversible, and your immediate mental and physical health are more important.
Think about the consequences of transitioning. If you are taking testosterone to transition, you must consider the effects these changes will have on your family ties and intimate relationships, your employment, your mental health, and your safety.

, Testosterone works to masculinize your body, and it does this through vocal, mental, and physical changes. Testosterone may significantly redistribute your body fat, stop your menstrual cycle, and/or increase the size or sensitivity of your clitoris. Excess testosterone in your body will be converted to estrogen, which may delay the desired changes or cause unwanted or dangerous side effects.You may experience some, all, or none of these changes or side effects, but it is important to keep track of any changes and talk to your doctor about them.

"
Make a list of questions and concerns about testosterone before visiting the doctor.As with any other health condition or prescription drug, it is important to be informed before talking with your doctor so as to avoid confusion or misunderstanding.,
Consult a doctor about whether you need to take testosterone.Your doctor can run tests to help you determine if supplemental testosterone would help you.In men, low testosterone is diagnosed by a full-body examination that helps rule out alternatives to low testosterone levels like pituitary tumors or thyroid problems.,
Don’t assume you need testosterone just because your levels are lower than average.Normal testosterone levels can vary from person to person, and there is in fact no absolute definition of low testosterone.,
Stay aware of cardiovascular problems.Testosterone has the potential to negatively impact your cardiovascular health.,
Look for other side effects.,
Monitor your mental, physical, and sexual health for changes and side effects.Testosterone therapy can cause significant changes in your mental, physical, and sexual health, and it is important that you keep track of these changes and any side effects so that you can discuss them with your doctor during your next visit.",How to Decide to Take Testosterone3," If you are worried about any of the changes or side effects of testosterone, direct your questions to the doctor. You may want to ask:


What are the side effects of testosterone supplements?
Do I need to see an endocrinologist?
How do my testosterone levels look?
If your doctor is not knowledgeable about hormone replacement therapy for female to male transitions, or is not comfortable with prescribing testosterone to you, you may need to find another primary care physician or specialist who does have experience with hormone replacement therapy.

, You’ll also have your blood tested directly for testosterone levels.


If you have any conditions that could be worsened by taking testosterone (like blood clots or hormone-sensitive cancers), you may need additional tests. Your doctor might recommend an alternative treatment.
You might also simply need to exercise more or change your diet to correct symptoms like increased fat, decreased bone mass, and feelings of fatigue.
Your doctor might direct you to see an endocrinologist, a doctor who specializes in hormones.
It is illegal to buy, sell, or use testosterone without a prescription from a healthcare professional.

, Be sure to get at least two or three tests to establish your baseline testosterone level before deciding supplements are a good choice.


These tests will probably be performed in the morning, since that is when testosterone levels tend to be lowest.
A healthy testosterone range for men ranges from 250 – 1,100 nanograms per deciliter of blood.
Taking additional testosterone will not speed up puberty.
Testosterone treatments are not appropriate for age-related declines in testosterone levels.

, This might take the form of heart palpitations or arrhythmia, a fluttering or racing heart, or heart valve problems that could produce lightheadedness, chest pain, or general feelings of fatigue. Truly dangerous side effects include heart attacks, strokes, and heart failure.These side effects increase in likelihood with age.

, Common side effects of testosterone supplements include a high red blood cell count, breast enlargement, acne, and increased prostate size.Less common side effects include blood clots or swelling (edema) in the legs and/or ankles, pain in the breast, and sleep apnea (an inability to breathe properly during sleep). Testosterone has also been linked to negative sexual results, including changes in the size of testicles and low sperm counts.You might also experience:


Increased skin oiliness and acne
Unbalanced emotions (especially at high doses)
Headaches and migraines
An increased appetite
Weight gain and redistribution of fat around the abdomen
Unwanted or excessive body hair growth
Increased sweat production and stronger body odor
A receding hairline or male-pattern baldnessAn imbalance in thyroid function, especially if you have been treated for overactive or underactive thyroid function in the past.

, Some doctors rely on your reports of physical and mental changes to adjust your dosage rather than doing expensive blood tests during every visit, and your comfort level with the changes can be used to determine whether your dosage or prescription should be changed.


Before beginning testosterone therapy, your doctor should test your red blood cell count (hematocrit). Testosterone can cause an increase in hematocrit and hemoglobin, which increases the viscosity of your blood. This can make you at risk for blood clots and stroke.
Follow up with your doctor for routine exams and blood tests to stay healthy. You will need medical supervision for the entire time you are using hormone replacement therapy and for a while after you stop taking testosterone to detect and control any harmful changes or side effects.
If you decide that you do not wish to continue testosterone therapy, you are free to stop at any time, in consultation with your doctor. They can help you through any side effects from stopping hormone replacement therapy, and can help you find other treatments that can lessen your symptoms and help you reach your goals.

Use testosterone patches.Patches are simple to use.,
Take testosterone through injections.Injections are usually the least expensive and fastest form of delivery, and they can be delivery weekly, biweekly, or monthly, depending on which compound your doctor prescribes.,
Take testosterone nasal gel.This method works similarly to any other nasal spray, except you do not breathe in when applying the gel.,
Use caution.",How to Decide to Take Testosterone4," Simply apply the patch to the skin on your arms, thighs, or stomach. The best time to apply patches is before bed. The patch will replace your body’s testosterone with newer, more effective testosterone.


Do not apply the patches to an open sore or wound, an area that is hairy or oily, or an area above a bone (such as your shoulder or hip).

, If you choose to use injections, your doctor will write you a prescription for appropriate tools (needles, pellets, or syringes).


Injections come either as pellets that are inserted beneath the skin, or as a liquid shot.
You may need to buy a special container to dispose of your used needles.
You may choose to switch from injections to another, slower-release method after you have been on testosterone for a few months and have begun to see significant changes.
If you chose to use injections, your doctor will likely schedule you for a follow-up appointment. You will need to bring your vial of testosterone, needles, and syringes to the appointment. They will teach you or a caregiver how to do the injections.
You might also choose to return to the doctor’s office to have them do your injections for you, often for the cost of your insurance plan’s co-payment.

, Simply place the small dispenser bottle into your nostril and squeeze the pump. Repeat on the opposite nostril. Squeeze your nostrils together gently and massage them gently for a few seconds.


Do not blow your nose or sniff deeply for the hour following your testosterone treatment.
Wash your hands if the spray gets on your skin.

, Except for slow-release implants, the delivery methods for testosterone can be taken at home. After you receive your prescription from the pharmacy, follow the instructions on the packaging to administer the first dose. Do not take more than the prescribed dose.


Patches, injections, and nasal gels are not recommended for correcting age-related testosterone level decline.Over-medicating can cause serious side effects, and it can decrease the effectiveness of the drug because your body converts excess testosterone into estrogen.

Talk to your doctor about other medical conditions.",How to Cope With the Side Effects of Coreg (Carvedilol)," People that are prescribed carvedilol fall into three main groups. They include people that have high blood pressure, a condition called congestive heart failure, or have had a heart attack in the past that left them with problems with the way the left ventricle of their heart functions.Carvedilol is a nonselective beta-blocker that also has alpha-adrenergic blocking activity. That means that carvedilol helps to reduce the work that your heart needs to do.
In general, carvedilol relaxes the blood vessels and slows down the rhythmic beats of your heart. This allows for your blood to carry enough oxygen to and from your heart to allow it function and continue to provide enough blood flow to keep your other organs healthy, even if your heart has problems.
By relaxing the blood vessels and slowing down your heart rate, your blood flow improves and your blood pressure is reduced.
Beta-blockers as a class are used in the treatment of other conditions. Some of these include angina, arrhythmias, helping your heart to beat when the walls of the heart muscle are too thick (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), other heart conditions that prevent the heart from either filling or emptying efficiently, migraine headaches, glaucoma, tremors, and even some types of anxiety.;
, When nonselective beta-blockers, including carvedilol, are prescribed for specific medical conditions, it is not possible to tell the drug which receptors to block and which ones to ignore. This means that you get the benefit of the drug, but you also get some side effects based on how the drug does its job.Naturally occurring chemicals called catecholamines are found everywhere in your body, including the tissues of your heart muscle.
When catecholamines bind to their receptors normally, they cause natural increases in heart rate, contractions of the heart muscle, increases in blood pressure, and relaxation of areas in your lungs and airways that help your lungs to expand when you are exercising.
Beta-blockers work by preventing the catecholamines from binding to their receptors. This is why your heart rate is slowed, the beating of your heart can be managed, and your blood pressure can be dropped.
Because of the way beta-blockers do their job, sometimes unwanted effects come along with the benefits.

, Since the receptors that are acted on by beta-blockers are located throughout your body, the list of possible serious side effects is quite lengthy. Any reaction that you feel is a sudden and serious change warrants medical attention, even if it is not found in this list. Some of the most serious side effects that require prompt or emergency medical attention include the following:Sudden weight gain, swelling, numbness, and tingling in the hands, feet, legs, or ankles, or a weakness or heaviness in the legs
Pain, stiffness, or swelling in your joints, including pain in your great toe, and body pain in your arm, back, jaw, side, or stomach, muscle pain or cramping, and a sudden or severe headache
Changes in your kidney and bowel function that include bloody, black, or tarry stools, cloudy or dark urine, blood in your urine, increased urination, or a decrease in the frequency or amount of urine
Confusion, loss of consciousness, depression, loss of the ability to speak, slurred speech, loss of vision, nervousness, shakiness, seizures, or changes in sleep patterns including nightmares
Cool or cold skin, sweats, flushed or dry skin, sudden weakness of the body on only one side, unusual bleeding or bruising, yellow tint to the eyes or skin, or dizziness or faintness when getting up suddenly
Flu-like symptoms, chills, fever, cough, loss or change in appetite, noisy breathing, fruit-like odor to the breath, trouble breathing even at rest, pounding sound in the ears, a pounding and slowed heart rate, a sudden change in pulse or blood pressure, and rapid breathing

, Any time you develop symptoms that are consistent with those of an allergic reaction, seek immediate medical attention.Watch for signs of an allergic reaction if you are just beginning carvedilol, have recently switched brands, or have recently changed from the regular tablets to an extended release product.
Symptoms of an allergic reaction include difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, swelling of your facial area including your lips and tongue, difficulty swallowing or a feeling that your throat is swollen or closing, feeling dizzy or faint, a new rash or hives anywhere on your body, slowing of your heart rate to less than 50 beats per minute, swelling in your legs, ankles, or feet, and a feeling of coldness in your hands or feet.

, Some side effects occur that do not need immediate medical attention and may improve as your body adjusts to the medication or to a recent change in dose. Any side effect that is persistent or disruptive to your daily routines warrants medical attention. Some side effects that occur more commonly include the following:Unusual tiredness or weakness, joint and muscle pain, loss of strength, poor energy levels, sleepiness or unusual drowsiness, or a general feeling of discomfort or illness
Diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, or stomach pain
Back pain, difficulty moving, joint pain, or muscle pain
Decreased interest in sexual activity and difficulty having or keeping an erection
Feeling dizzy, a sensation of spinning, or a feeling of constant movement of your body or the surroundings
Changes in vision, blurred vision, headache, persistent breath odor or bad taste in your mouth, changes in your gum tissue, sore throat, or stuffy or runny nose

, Carvedilol may not be the only medication you are taking that is causing you to feel tired.Try to limit your daytime use of medications that you take for pain that are prescribed “as needed.”
Take the medication when you need it of course, but realize that prescription strength pain medications can also cause fatigue.
Prescription strength pain medications that are prescribed on a scheduled basis can possibly be dose adjusted to still provide for your pain management needs, but at a lower daytime dose.
Work with your doctor to reach a dose that is high enough to provide the relief you need, but lower than what you currently take since you are having trouble with feeling tired during the day.
Medications other than pain medications also cause fatigue and tiredness. Review all your medications with your doctor, or a trained pharmacologist, to look at the way your meds are influencing your functioning and how they may be influencing each other.
There are usually options in adjusting prescribed medication regimens to reduce problems with fatigue and other persistent side effects.

, There is nothing you can do to stop the drug from causing the fatigue but there are things you can do make it less of a problem.Take small sips of a caffeinated beverage, such as coffee or tea, throughout the day. Be sure this is ok with your doctor and will not cause problems for your medical condition.
Ask your doctor if you can try adjusting your medication times and doses. You clearly need to be on carvedilol, but it may be possible to take a smaller dose in the morning and a higher dose at bedtime to help with daytime fatigue.
Never stop or adjust your medication without talking to your doctor first. The safe use of the medication is the most important factor.

, Since carvedilol is likely to make you feel fatigued and low on energy, be sure you are getting enough rest so your own sleep needs are not contributing to the side effects of the medication.The amount of sleep people need varies from person to person. Take additional steps to determine your sleep needs and adjust your schedule accordingly.
Keep a regular and scheduled bedtime and a regular time to get up each morning.
Take that extra nap, take a break, or just sit down when you need to. Consider scheduling a mid-afternoon short nap, and don’t feel guilty about it. Napping gives you renewed energy and a fresh outlook when you wake up.
Realize that the medication is making you feel fatigued and low on energy and don’t just try to fight your way past it. Give your body the rest it needs as you adjust to your medication.

, Most people that experience stomach problems feel it to be a lingering feeling of nausea and related symptoms that lasts for several hours each day.Try sipping on ginger ale or other carbonated beverage during the times you feel nauseous. Don’t wait until it starts if you know it happens every day at the same general time.
Eat a few saltine crackers with the ginger ale.
Have your beverage over ice chips, and continue to suck on those ice chips once your beverage is gone.
Try to determine if the nausea is more of a problem when you have eaten, or when your stomach is empty. Consider smaller meals throughout the day, instead of the typical three meals a day schedule, to help settle your stomach.
Eating smaller meals more frequently can also control the amount of food your stomach is digesting and decrease the intensity of stomach cramps and diarrhea.
Avoid eating spicy foods or any foods that you identify as triggers for the abdominal cramping and diarrhea.

, It is possible that your doctor will not advise you to resume sexual activity, but if she approves and you are experiencing ED, she may be able to prescribe a medication to treat this side effect.Drugs that fall in the category of agents that treat erectile dysfunction are safe for use with carvedilol, provided your doctor agrees. There are, however, potential drug interactions, which may cause hypotension, or low blood pressure.Sildenafil and tadalafil are two commonly used drugs to treat erectile dysfunction.Agents like these may help to reduce any problems you may be having with sexual function as a result of taking carvedilol. Because of the risk of hypotension, you will need to take these drugs under strict supervision if your doctor prescribes them.

, As with everything, talk to your doctor before you make changes in your routine or medications that may help to minimize the joint and muscle pain and stiffness.Consider stretching exercises or yoga classes.
Take a warm or hot shower each morning to reduce the muscle and joint pain and stiffness.
Apply heat throughout the day to areas that are particular troublesome.
Ask your doctor about taking anti-inflammatory agents or mild muscle relaxers for the joint and muscle pain and stiffness. Some over-the-counter agents may interfere with how well the carvedilol works, so you doctor may want to carefully monitor the dose of both drugs.
Some muscle relaxer agents can also cause fatigue so use with caution if your doctor agrees.

, This is an area that may require the help of your doctor in pursuing adjustment of your glasses or other visual aids.Be sure you have reached your target dose before you make an appointment with your eye doctor to consider adjusting your glasses or contacts accordingly.
Adjusting your eyeglasses or contacts may help with the feeling of dizziness.
If you continue to have trouble with dizziness or a spinning sensation, consider an early morning exercise and stretching routine that improves your circulation to help reduce those side effects.
Low-dose prescription medications can also be tried, such as meclizine, but they may add to the fatigue in some cases.

, Many people experience weight gain, muscle weakness, fatigue, and low energy levels, along with many other of the side effects previously listed, and feel the medication is making it difficult to maintain their quality of life. This makes it especially challenging to consider making changes in your life when you have less energy than before, and the situation feels beyond your control.Making some changes in your normal routines can help to offset some of the side effects and give you back some of the control you may feel has been lost.
Keep in mind that adjusting things within your control to address some of the side effects may also be strengthening your heart and helping to lower your blood pressure.
By taking steps to strengthen your heart and lower your blood pressure, you may reach a point where the dose of medication can be substantially reduced.

, Now is the time to make changes in your diet if you have not already done so. Eat a diet that can help enhance the treatment of your condition, give your body the nutrients in needs, and limit unnecessary calories.Include a variety of fruits and vegetables, especially dark and leafy vegetables. Incorporate whole grains, low-fat dairy products, skinless poultry and fish, nuts and legumes, and non-tropical vegetable oils.
If you choose to eat red meat occasionally, select cuts of meat that are lean.
Try to cut back on your use of salt and avoid using salt during food preparation. Limit your daily intake of sodium to no more than 2400mg each day. Set a goal of reaching 1500mg per day. Even a reduction from your usual intake if it exceeds these limits is a step in the right direction.
Avoid sugary foods and beverages that contain sugar.
Talk to the grocery shopper and chef in your household if it is someone other than yourself. Stress the importance of selecting and preparing foods that are in the best interest of your cardiac health.
Eat reasonable portions sizes especially when you are dining out.
Limit your alcohol intake to one drink per day for a female and no more than two drinks per day for a male. Avoid drinking alcohol within two hours of taking your carvedilol dose. Alcohol can interfere with the way the drug is absorbed and can contribute to unwanted side effects.

Quit smoking and avoid secondhand smoke.

, Many people suffer the fatigue and muscle weakness associated with carvedilol and struggle with physical activity. Even so, your effort at increasing your level of physical activity can pay off in many ways. One of which is helping to manage the weight gain related to carvedilol and another is the possibility of improving your cardiac health so you may reach a point where you can reduce your dosage.Always discuss your exercise plans with your doctor. It may be best to begin in a monitored environment such as a cardiac rehab program or with the help of a physical therapist.
One key point as you start your exercise program is to keep track of your daily intake of calories so you can be sure you are burning those calories in order to prevent weight gain.
Carvedilol prevents your heart rate from rising too far and too quickly. Do not expect to use your pulse rate as a method of measuring the intensity of your workout.
With the help of your doctor, determine how much exercise you should plan for, how many times a week and for how long each time, the types of exercises you should do, the ones you should avoid. Also develop a plan for timing your medications around your exercise routine.

, Limit your outdoor exposure if it is too hot, too cold, or too humid, stay well hydrated during your workout, and always ease into your routine. If you have been sick or away from your workout routine for a period of time, take care to start again gradually and slowly.


If you have trouble once you have started, then stop until the problem is resolved.
Examples of situations that may warrant stopping include excessive fatigue, shortness of breath, irregular heart rate, and unusual pain anywhere, but especially chest pain.
Stop your workout if you notice a sudden change in your heart rate, develop irregular heartbeats, or palpitations.
If you experience unexpected pain, especially chest pain, stop and call your doctor or call 911. Call your doctor or seek urgent medical care if you feel pressure in your chest, or radiating pressure or pain into your arm, neck area, jaw, or shoulder.
If you feel dizzy, faint, lightheaded, or if you pass out, call your doctor or seek urgent medical attention.

, Don’t stop your medication. Talk to your doctor and let him or her know about persistent side effects. Discuss ways to manage them and still get the benefit you need from the medication. Sometimes, doses can be adjusted, timing can be altered, different medications can be tried, or you can be switched to or from a longer acting product that can help reduce your side effects.You are the most important member of your healthcare team. Take an active role in monitoring your condition. This may lead to a lower dose if your condition is stable or improves.
Take the medication properly. Take your dose(s) at the same time every day. Twice daily dosing is best at eight to ten hour intervals.
Carvedilol is best absorbed if taken with food. By taking with food consistently, your body gets more from each dose and may lead to a good response that can allow you to talk to your doctor about trying a lower dose.
Do not crush, open or break the tablets or capsules. Especially if you have the controlled release form of the medication.
Some dosage forms allow for crushing or opening the capsule for people that have a difficult time swallowing. The crushed tablet or contents of the capsule can be spread on a small amount of applesauce or other food easy to swallow. Do not do this without making sure the tablets or capsules prescribed for you are safe to be crushed or opened.
If you are allowed to break your tablets for dosing reasons, do not break more than what you immediately need. Many drugs lose their strength when exposed to air. Only open or break what you need for that dose, or that day’s doses.

, Several types of home devices are available to measure your blood pressure at home. Be sure you select a device your doctor agrees with since there are many different types of products available. Take it with you to the next appointment to have it calibrated.This means that you, the nurse, or doctor, will take your blood pressure with your new machine and also with their equipment in the office to be sure the readings are the same, or at least close.
Select a cuff that is appropriate for the size of your arm and choose a device that has large numbers and a display that is easy to read.
Talk to your doctor to identify which arm he or she wants you to use to take your pressure. There is a slight difference in your blood pressure readings from your left and right arm, and this may be important depending on your diagnosis.
Take your readings at the same general time each day, and take multiple readings each time. Wait about one to two minutes between readings. Remove the cuff between the readings.
Sit with your back straight and supported like in a solid dining table chair rather than the sofa. Make sure both feet are flat on the floor and don’t cross your legs. Make sure your arm rests comfortably on a table.

, Avoid relying on your memory. Keep a journal or log with your device and record every reading. Take this with you to each appointment.


Write your doctor’s phone number in your journal or log. Clearly indicate in your log the blood pressure numbers that he or she wants to know about immediately. Also write down your doctor’s guides for your pulse rate that he or she considers normal for you, and when you need to call your doctor based on your pulse rate.Notify your doctor if you get a high reading. Be sure you know in advance what your doctor considers “high” for you.
In most cases, systolic readings greater than 180, which is the first and higher number, or diastolic readings greater than 110 are considered a medical emergency.
Check your pulse at the same time. Most devices that monitor your blood pressure will also give you a pulse reading. Follow your doctor’s instructions on when to notify him or her for either high, low, or irregular pulse rates.
Use your journal to record activities you participated in and anything unusual in your diet that can help to identify triggers that cause your condition or the side effects to be more prominent.

, Call 911 if you experience signs of heart problems, chest pain, tightness or pressure, or pain that spreads to your jaw, neck or arm.

, Your doctor may be able to help address problems that are making it difficult for you to function on a day-to-day basis.Always let your doctor know if other healthcare providers adjust any of your medications.

, There are some disease states that carvedilol should not be used in, and some that require caution.Carvedilol should not be used in people with asthma or related lung disorders, severe problems with liver function, and in some people that have a tendency to develop severe allergic reactions.

You may experience unpleasant withdrawal symptoms that can be severe. Call your prescriber immediately if you are uncomfortable taking medications and tell the staff what is going on. You may be able to get an answer over the phone from your doctor as to whether or not you should continue the medication — they may advise you to stop.Say to your physician, “My medication appears to be affecting the way I feel and I want to stop taking it. Here’s what’s going on.”;
, If you feel like new changes in your mood may be related to your medication, schedule an appointment with your prescriber and let them know your concerns. If the symptoms are bothering you, don’t wait it out or hope they will go away. It’s likely that your prescriber can make some changes to help ease the symptoms.


Call your prescriber as soon as possible. If you’re feeling miserable, let them know so that changes can be made.
Say, “I’m noticing some changes to how I feel and wonder if it could be due to my medication. Is this common for this prescription? What can we do?”
Before your appointment, make a list of all the ways in which you think you have changed. This could include the onset of new symptoms or experiencing a sudden absence of something you normally feel or experience.

, Some medications appear to increase thoughts of suicide, such as varenicline (Chantix) and some antidepressants.If your medication makes you feel increasingly suicidal, call your prescriber right away. They will likely discontinue medication and suggest you seek some kind of support.


You can call a suicide hotline (in the USA: 1-800-273-8255; Australia: 13-11-14; UK: 0800 068 41 41).
Call a friend to come help you or call for an ambulance to take you to the emergency department.
You can also call emergency services.
If you are feeling depressed but not suicidal, you might want to tell any family living with you or trusted friends so that they can check in with you on a regular basis.

, Sometimes, depression can make someone feel isolated, alone, or withdrawn from others. Spending time with people you care about is one of the easiest ways to reduce stress and feel better and more balanced in your mood. Spend time with friends and family in person as much as you can. While technology makes texting or emailing easy, you’ll benefit more from seeing someone face-to-face.Have a weekly get-together with friends or family over dinner. Meet your friends for a workout class or for coffee.
You may find that socializing wears you out more quickly when you're depressed. It is okay to rest and have alone time afterward, just make sure that you are socializing regularly and not isolating yourself.

, Exercise is a great way to beat stress, feel energized, and balance your mood. In some studies, exercise is just as effective as medication in treating mild to moderate depression.Schedule your exercise during a part of the day when your energy is highest. This may be first thing in the morning or during your lunch break. If you don’t like going to the gym, focus on other physical activities that you enjoy.


For example, take a morning walk with your dog or start attending karate classes.Don’t be afraid to start small. Even 10 minutes each day is better than nothing.

, Feeling relaxed can help you cope with the symptoms of depression, deal with stress, and increase your feelings of well-being. Spending time relaxing can help you work through stress and help to stabilize your moods.Aim to do a relaxing activity for 30 minutes each day. Watching TV doesn’t count!


Find relaxation methods that feel good to you. Try daily yoga, qi gong, tai chi, and meditation.

, Feeling depressed can make you isolate yourself and withdraw from activities you enjoy. Do something you enjoy or try a new hobby and stick with it, even when you dread leaving the house. Doing something you enjoy can help boost your mood and increase your self-esteem. Creating something (like woodwork or sewing) can bring satisfaction.Try painting, planting a garden, or learning a new language.
If you feel like skipping the activity, try telling yourself you will just go for 20 or 30 minutes and then you can leave if you're still not feeling it. You may find that, once you get over the hump of getting out, you will enjoy yourself and want to stay.

, The foods you put into your body can affect how you feel. Avoid substances such as tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, and sugar, as these can affect your mood. Focus on eating several small meals throughout the day in order to maintain your energy levels. Pay attention to your nutrition to make sure you are eating healthy, balanced meals that contribute to your health, not take away from it.If you struggle with eating healthfully or have dietary restrictions, consider working with a dietician to help you eat better.

, The more you can tell your physician about the changes in your mood, the better they can pinpoint and address the symptoms related to your medication. Tell your prescriber about any changes that have affected your mood, sleeping, or thoughts since taking the medications. Talk about how the symptoms came on, whether gradually or suddenly. Keep a record of any changes in your mood throughout the day and how they may be related to medication.Generally, drug-induced depression means that symptoms begin to occur within a month of starting or stopping medication.
Recognize the symptoms of depression such as feelings of sadness or hopelessness; loss of interest in normal activities (sex, work, hobbies, sports, etc.); sleeping too much or too little; changes in appetite; unexplained physical problems (backache, headache, etc.); feelings of anger or frustration, even over small things; or difficulty concentrating, thinking, or making decisions.Remember to tell your physician about any supplements or over-the-counter medications you are also taking, as these can interact with your prescriptions. Also be sure to mention any major life changes or stressors as these may contribute to your depression.

, If you’re having problems with one medication and another is available, your prescriber may recommend a different medication.This is often the easiest solution if it’s available. If the new medication is as effective as your current medication yet does not carry a risk of depression as a side-effect, your physician may recommend this as the first response to treatment.


Ask your prescriber what options are available to you and what carries the smallest risk of depression as a side-effect.
You may be able to switch medications right away or slowly over time. Talk with your physician about how to transition safely.

, Sometimes, symptoms of depression may go away once your prescriber lowers your dosage. If you’ve noticed changes in your mood alongside changes in your medication dosage, ask your prescriber for a different dosage.This can be a balancing act of attaining an effective dosage of one medication yet experiencing the least amount of side-effects.

, If you cannot take a different dosage or medication, your prescriber may treat the depression with another medication.Especially if medication has worsened an already existing diagnosis of depression, starting medication for depression may help ease symptoms.People with a history of depression may have worsening symptoms with certain medications. For this reason, starting antidepressant medication may be beneficial.

, If you’re feeling increasingly depressed without any sense of relief, therapy can help you learn to cope better and more effectively. Ongoing symptoms of depression can interfere with your life and therapy can help you cope with the serious side-effects you experience. Many people experience symptoms of depression and therapy can be a great way to learn skills and effectively cope with these symptoms.Especially if your depression is pre-existing and worsening after medication, therapy can be a great help.


Stressors may feel even more stressful if you’re depressed. A therapist can help you work through your thoughts and feelings and find more adaptive ways to approach stressful situations.
Call your local mental health clinic or insurance provider for a referral. You can also ask for a recommendation from your general practitioner, family, or friends.

Wear a jockstrap for comfort and protection while playing sports.,
Make sure your jockstrap fits correctly.,
Decide if you will be wearing a cup.,
Choose your cup.,
Consider wearing compression shorts over your cup-jockstrap if you think the cup- jockstrap fits too loose and does not hold the cup tight enough against your body.",How to Wear a Jockstrap1," A jockstrap is recommended for any sport that requires running, such as track and field or basketball.For contact sports or sports involving fast-moving balls, a cup is also recommended.;
, You will want to consider waist size and pouch comfort.

Some men wear a cup-jockstrap in daily wear, not just when playing sports, to augment their masculine appearance.Many athletes are reluctant to wear cups, particularly in football,but consider that more than half of all testicular injuries occur during sports and testicular torsion and testicular rupture can lead to losing a testicle.

For a cup to work, it must fit tightly against the body. You will want to make sure your jockstrap is tight enough to prevent the cup from rolling or twisting.
Look for cups with cushioned edges. A hard edge will just transfer the force of the blow to the pelvic area. A soft edge provides better cushioning during impact.For really fast moving sports like lacrosse or baseball, consider a titanium cup., Compression shorts offer similar support as a jockstrap, and some compression shorts come with a pouch designed to hold a protective cup, but many compression shorts that have a pouch do not hold the cup tight against the body. It is better to wear a cup in a cup-jockstrap and then wear tight fitting compression shorts over the cup-jockstrap to hold the cup firmly in place and tight against the body. In many sports such as football, compression shorts are now preferred by many athletes. But remember always that the cup must be held firmly in place and tight against the body for it function properly."

Medicare Part D: If you are a Medicare recipient you want to make sure that the pharmacy accepts ALL Medicare Part D plans. As a Medicare Part D patient, sometimes one plan becomes cheaper than another. You want to make sure that if you change plans you won’t have to change pharmacies. You can refer to http://www.medicare.gov for more information.

, Walmart recently released a list of generic drugs that they offer at $4 for a 30 day supply.
Price Matching: Some pharmacies such as ShopKo pharmacy, are matching these prices, so you don’t necessarily have to go to Walmart to get these prices. If the prescription you are currently on does not have a generic or the generic isn’t on the $4 list, then you will want to call different pharmacies in your town to find the lowest price. You can also ask if the pharmacy will price match. This can be a plus if one pharmacy offers the lowest price on one of your prescriptions but not the lowest price on another. If that pharmacy will match the price of another pharmacy, then you won’t have to go to two different pharmacies.

, It deals with patient rights. When choosing a pharmacy, make sure that they comply with the current HIPAA laws. Most pharmacies will have a sign posted about private consultations and a patient’s right to privacy. Make sure that your pharmacy has a private consult area. This will ensure that when you need an “embarrassing” prescription the pharmacist will be able to give you a private consultation. To learn more about HIPAA visit the Health Informarion Privacy Site.

, When your sick and the pharmacist suggests that along with your prescription, Tylenol can help your sore throat, you don’t want to have to drive to another store to have to get it.

, The same goes for a pharmacy. You want a pharmacy that will call your insurance company if there is a problem. You want a pharmacy that will work with your doctor on dosing and refill issues. Also, knowing the name of at least one of your pharmacists is always a good thing. It is nice to have someone to ask health questions without having to go to a doctor., Smaller inventory pharmacies often have run out of drugs and this causes the patient to have to wait a day or two to get your prescription while they order it. Or you will have to go to another pharmacy that has your prescribed drug in stock. Every pharmacy cannot guarantee that they will have your prescribed drug 100% of the time, but if they have a large inventory, the odds are pretty good that they will have it in stock.

Look at the product labeling.,
Choose a product with the active ingredient retinol — not other derivatives.,
Know that similar sounding ingredients are not the same.,
Choose a reputable brand.,
Buy a low-concentration retinol, to start.,
Choose a moisturizer with soothing ingredients.,
Move up gradually to higher concentrations.,
Don’t be impressed by big names.,
Watch out for gimmicky ingredients.,
Aim for a price range of $15 to $30.",How to Choose an over the Counter Retinol Product," First of all, you’ll want to find an over-the-counter anti-aging product that actually works and actually contains retinol. So, you should take a close look at labels. This can be hard, as there tends to be a lot of jargon as well as misleading claims on skin care products. You will have to learn to cut through the noise.


Know that the ingredients in skin care products are listed in descending order. This means that ingredients with the largest amounts are listed first. If an ingredient is listed at the end, there isn’t much of it present.However, keep in mind that you don’t always need that much of active ingredients – retinol content of 0.1% or less is fairly standard.Don’t get taken in by flashy marketing. Labels might claim that a product is “dermatologist tested” or something similar. This doesn’t mean that dermatologists endorse it, however.;
, Retinol as well as the retinoids and retinoic acid in prescription creams are all derived from Vitamin A and get synthesized by your skin in the same basic way. Not all over-the-counter products are created equal, however. Some active ingredients are just not as effective in repairing wrinkles.


Take a close look at each product’s active ingredient. This should be listed in the product label under “active pharmaceutical ingredient (API).”
Favor products that use retinol as the API. Retinol is gentler on the skin than the tretinoin found in prescription formulas, but it gets converted at the cellular level into the same chemical., You’ll probably notice that some skin care products have names that sound an awful lot like retinol. These are often other Vitamin A derivatives and are called “pro-retinols,” i.e. retinyl palmitate, retinyl acetate, retinyl propionate, and retinyl linoleate.Retinyl propionate is a derivative of retinol, but it doesn’t offer the same anti-aging benefits as retinol.Derivatives of retinol are in general weaker and less effective than retinol. If your goal is to smooth fine lines and wrinkles, you’d probably be better off choosing something with plain retinol.

, One problem with over-the-counter retinols and other skincare products is that they aren’t regulated (prescription products must be FDA-approved, so they go through vigorous testing).This means that companies don’t have to list the amount of the active ingredient, so you can’t be exactly sure how much you are using.


Consider a brand that you know and trust, especially if you are new to retinols. This will make it more likely that the level of retinol you get is sufficient to improve your skin.
For instance, you might try brands like Neutrogena, Olay, Vichy, Aveeno, or other reputable manufacturers.

, Retinoids and retinol tend to cause some skin inflammation and redness, especially in the beginning.If you have naturally sensitive skin or red and inflamed acne, normal over-the-counter retinol products can make the situation worse. You might therefore want to start with a low-concentration and work your way up.


Topical retinoids can cause what’s called “retinoid dermatitis” even in people with normal skin. This is characterized by redness, scaling, dryness, and pruritis. The level of irritation correlates with the strength and concentration of Vitamin A in the product.Look for the words “sensitive skin” on the label, which will generally mean that the product has lower concentrations of active retinol. Be aware that low-concentration creams and lotions are not as effective but are gentler.

, While your skin gets used to retinol, it may become irritated. If possible, go with a retinol moisturizer that is not only lower in concentration but that also has added ingredients for sensitive skin. This should help to soothe the skin as it builds up a tolerance to the retinol. Moisturize your face every day to keep your skin looking fresh and healthy.Try something like RoC Retinol Correxion Sensitive Night Cream or Avéne’s RetrinAL, which are both targeted at more sensitive skin. For instance, the latter contains a less irritating Vitamin A derivative called retinaldehyde as well as thermal spring water, which offers an anti-inflammatory effect. Lancer Younger: Pure Youth Serum also has calming peptides.You can also reduce inflammation further by applying the retinol every other night and by following it up with a good moisturizer., Over time, as your cells turn over, your skin should become less irritated and more used to retinol.This adjustment period can be two to four weeks, though a total resolution of your complexion may take a few months. You can then move on to higher concentrations.Skin cells adapt to retinol in a few weeks and begin to build up tolerance for the ingredient. This means that minor irritation should start to subside.
Switch to a higher concentration of active retinol in order to see more anti-aging benefits. Many people eventually move from over-the-counter to prescription formulas with tretinoin, a Vitamin A derivative that can be up to 20 times more potent than retinol.

, There are a number of high-end, luxury retinol products on the market that boast impressive names. These are probably excellent, but you can get a quality product that works nearly as well for only a fraction of the price. Don’t think that a product will work better just because it costs more and has a fancy name.There are a lot of high-end retinols that sell for well over $100 a bottle, like NaturaBisse’s Essential Shock Intense Retinol Fluid ($105) or Kate Somerville DermalQuench Liquid Lift ($98). These probably work great but are very pricey.Another bank-breaker is Youth Corridor by the surgeon Dr. Gerald Imber. This is most definitely for people with large budgets: $610 for a 50mL bottle!, Some high-end retinols also make use of expensive or gimmicky ingredients that add to price but don’t necessarily add anything major to the product’s effect on your skin. Be wary of these, as well, to find a good value retinol.


Perricone MD OVM serum is a pricey example at $155 for a 30 milliliters (1  fl oz) bottle. They claim the “secret ingredient” is egg shell membrane, which is supposed to protect your skin from irritation.The London-based surgeon Yannis Alexandrides offers a retinol product called “111 Skin Celestial Black Diamond,” which contains actual black diamond powder and costs $250 a bottle. You can probably go without the powdered diamonds., You can find a range of great retinol skincare products for less than $50. In fact, you can get good value from recognized brands without any gimmicky or outrageously expensive ingredient.You really don’t need to pay much more than $15 to $30.Look for something like Olay’s Regenerist Intensive Repair Treatment. This uses mild retinyl propionate and costs $29.99. Look for it at your pharmacy or online.
You might also try Aveeno’s Positively Radiant Targeted Tone Corrector, a retinol cream that lessens dark spots and costs about $15. Neutrogena also offers a Rapid Wrinkle Repair Serum with retinol for $20.99.
If you’re interested in an oil rather than a cream, try something like Sonia Kashuk’s Radiant Boost Restorative Facial Oil – natural oils and retinol for $14.99

Try breathing exercises.,
Try guided imagery.,
Meditate.",How to Increase Your Pain Tolerance1," If the body is overly stressed, like when it is in pain, it will respond to pain more acutely. However, if your body is relaxed, the pain tolerance is higher and you won’t feel as much pain. This is why women who are in labor or people who suffer from chronic pain can benefit from relaxed breathing exercises.For example, you can sit in a straight backed chair and close your eyes. Inhale for five seconds. Hold the breath for a few seconds, and then breathe out for seven or out seconds. Repeat this 10 times.
You can try extending the breathing exercises for 15 to 20 minutes. Sit in your chair and close your eyes. Focus on your heartbeat and use it to determine the length of your breaths. Inhale as you count five heartbeats, then hold for seven or eight heartbeats. Then, exhale for nine to ten heartbeats.;
, Guided imagery is used with chronic pain sufferers to help increase their pain tolerance and lower the pain they feel. Guided imagery helps replace the image in your mind that pain is negative and unbearable with something more positive.Start by breathing deeply. Focus on the present, just on the breaths as you inhale and exhale. Let everything go as your relax. Exhale all your worries as you inhale cleansing, restorative oxygen. Breathe until you feel in a complete state of relaxation.
Scan your body for parts that have pain. Inhale, and when you exhale, blow the pain away and breathe in again to replace it with healing air.
After you have done that, think of a beautiful, peaceful place. Focus on that place with your five senses. What do you see, hear, feel, taste, and smell? Continue to be present in this place.

, Meditation can help reduce your body’s response to pain and raise your tolerance. Relaxing your body, calming your mind, and focusing your attention away from the pain may be able to help you raise your pain threshold.Try closing your eyes while sitting straight. Breathe in and out, focusing on your breath. Look at your thoughts and your bodily sensations in a neutral, non-judgmental way. As you inhale, focus on the sensation of each breath. Stay in the moment and only focus on what is going on right that second.
Scan your body, focusing on each part of your body. Start at your toes and go up through your body. Mentally note any places that feel pain. Concentrate on the idea that pain is a bunch of sensations, not a tangible thing. Focus on the pain and become more aware of the pain.
After focusing on the pain, expand your mind to meditate on positive things around you. This could be pleasant weather or sounds, being near people you love, smelling pleasant aromas, or anything else. Be mindful that pain is only one thing among many that is going on at any given moment. Respond positively to the pain, accepting that it is there instead of resisting it or obsessing over it."

Increase physical activity.,
Exercise with a friend.,
Make small goals.,
Talk to your doctor before starting any physical activity.,
Monitor the levels of pain during physical activity.",How to Increase Your Pain Tolerance2," Exercise has been found to raise your pain tolerance. To get the benefits, you need to do regular aerobic exercise at least three times each week for thirty minutes. This exercise needs to be at a moderate to vigorous intensity.Exercise releases endorphins, which will help you not feel as much pain.

, Exercising with a friend or in a group can also increase your tolerance to pain. Being around others increases your endorphins, so you are getting benefits from the physical activity and from being social.Ask a friend to do a physical activity with you, like walking, hiking, swimming, or cycling.
Consider joining a group exercise class. Exercising with others can be more beneficial to pain management and pain tolerance than exercising alone.

, If you are suffering from pain, you may not think you can do any physical activity. However, this is not true. You can start participating in physical activities, but you may have to do it slowly at first. The more you do physical activities, the more manageable your pain will be.Start by identifying a physical activity you would like to do. This may be walking, hiking, swimming, or lifting light weights.
Come up with a measurable and achievable goal for your physical activity. This may be a time, distance, weight, or number of repetitions. For example, you may decide you want to walk a quarter of a mile today. Make sure the goal is something you can do at your current pain level.
Make a time frame to achieve the goal. This may be a few days or a week.
Then, once you hit your goal, increase it. You may make a goal to walk half a mile by the end of the week. Continue setting goals to improve your physical activity.

, If you have a pain condition, you should talk to your doctor before beginning physical activity. Talk to your doctor about your condition, which types of physical activities would be best for you, and what exercises may not be safe.You also may want to talk to your doctor about your pain tolerance and how to safely monitor your pain.

, While you exercise, you want to make sure you are not hurting yourself. Monitor your levels of pain during the exercise. Think about assigning a number to your level of pain, from one to ten. Ten is the worst, while one is the least.


You will probably feel discomfort, pain, and soreness while increasing physical activity. This will get better as you are more active.
However, if your pain increases to a seven or eight or higher, you should stop. Reduce the intensity of the exercise, change the exercise, or consult with your doctor.

Adopt better posture.,
Get adequate sleep.,
Increase your social circle.,
Reframe how you think about pain.,
Try cognitive-behavioral therapy.,
Swear when you feel pain.,
Avoid overmedicating.",How to Increase Your Pain Tolerance3," A scientific study found that people who adopt a dominant, powerful posture have a higher tolerance to pain than those in a submissive posture. To try this, keep your back straight, your shoulders square, and your head raised.Submissive postures are those where you are hunch your shoulders or curl into yourself.

, Being sleep deprived or not getting enough sleep each night can lower your pain tolerance. If you get enough sleep each night, you can raise your pain tolerance and deal with it better.Try to get seven to nine hours of sleep each night. Inadequate sleep more than once a week can lower your tolerance to pain.

, Having more friends and a larger social circle can increase your tolerance to pain. This is due to a higher release of endorphins, which helps reduce the amount of pain your body feels. By strengthening your relationships, spending more time with your friends, and making new friends, you may be able to increase your tolerance to pain.Laughing with friends in a social setting has also been found to raise your pain threshold., The way you think about pain may lower or raise your pain tolerance. Being mentally tough can help you tolerate the pain. Instead of thinking about how bad the pain hurts, instead think about the pain in a different way.For example, if you are working out, you can think about the pain being a sign that you are getting stronger and making your body better.

, Cognitive-behavioral therapy is a type of psychotherapy that replaces negative thoughts with healthier ones. Using CBT can help you learn how to cope with the pain and raise your tolerance. This should be done with the help of a trained psychologist, therapist, or other mental health professional. They will lead you through different CBT exercises and methods to help you change the way you view your pain.CBT helps change the way you view your pain. During CBT, you can put pain into context and realize that it doesn’t lessen your quality of life.
CBT can lessen stress associated with pain, therefore making the pain less of a problem and raising your threshold.
CBT allows you to feel like you are in control of the pain, which can help you feel more positive about the pain and tolerate it for longer.If you suffer from chronic pain, you can trick your mind by thinking, “That pain isn’t so bad” or “The pain is just part of what I’m feeling.”

, A study showed that when people swear, it raises their tolerance for pain. The study found that if you swear, you feel less pain than if you didn’t. The next time you feel pain, try swearing to relieve the pain.Swearing after you feel pain is considered a form of catastrophising, which is a way we change our mindset to deal with pain.
If you swear profusely on a daily basis, the study claims the effect will not be as strong.

, Some people try to deal with pain and increase their tolerance by using pain killers. This may be over-the-counter ones, like NSAIDS or acetaminophen, or prescription pain killers, like opiates. There are many non-medication ways to manage pain and raise your pain tolerance.

Seek counseling.",How to Understand the Male Ego," Stemming from the work of psychologists and psychotherapists in late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the ego can be defined most basically as the self. After all, ""ego"" means ""I"" in Latin.The ego is the part of the mind responsible for acting as the “mediator” between the forces and drives of the superego (our conscience and our ideal selves) and our ids (the part that is responsible for satisfying our basic needs). The ego operates in reality, and is also responsible for mediating between our own needs and how to satisfy them within our environments. The ego maintains relations with others, reconciling the drives of the id and the superego with the outside world. Many psychologists posited their own theories of the ego based upon Sigmund Freud’s explanation of the ego.In other words, the male ego is not only a reflection of the individual self, but also of cultural definitions of masculinity and ideas about how men should think and act. Men's identities are thus shaped by social influences. Humans are social beings after all!;
, In order to understand the male ego, it is necessary to understand how gender roles develop and function in society. Gender roles shape how people think and behave. Gender roles are sets of beliefs and actions that develop within specific cultural contexts and are associated with a particular biological sex (male or female). The roles help to differentiate between the sexes, so that men are seen to be one way and women another. By occupying these specific gender roles, some individuals function better within their particular social context while others may struggle.To understand the male ego, you need to understand how society shapes men's expectations of themselves. This is important because many men have developed ways of dealing with these social demands. In many cases, men aren't even aware of how society influences them. For example, most men don't really know how they came to be sports fans or think that blue, green, and gray are boys' colors while pink and purple are girls' colors.

, The male ego is driven by recognition, attention, and action. Men are assumed to be more active beings who do important things (such as political leaders, soldiers, scientists, etc.) and who are deserving of attention by others. In this vision of the male ego, men are driven by their physical strength, sex drive, and evolutionary biology as competitors for female attention to be competitive, to strive for greatness and power, and to avoid showing any emotion and weakness.For example, in most American communities, the male gender role is typically understood and described in active as opposed to passive terms. Men are courageous, strong, competitive, independent, and stable (in contrast, women are passive, emotional, weak, and more socially-oriented). To give another example, men in many communities in the western world are expected to avoid showing emotion. Remember the old saying ""boys don't cry?"" Instead, men are supposed to be macho and strong in the face of personal challenges, such as loss, grief, and sadness., A lot of men feel conflicted about having to be a certain type of man. For example, what about men who are not attracted to women, even though heterosexuality is still seen as the norm in today's society? Or what about men who enjoy pedicures and facials, things considered ""girly"" or feminine?


It’s important to find out how individual men feel about and respond to these social expectations of how men should be because they will vary in each and every case.

, All men and women have emotions, even if they show them in different ways. Men who don’t show much emotion still have emotions, but because of social conditioning they have learned not to show their emotions too much or at all.This might mean that the man in your life might remain stoic when someone important to him dies.
Since anger is an emotion that is more acceptable for men to show, in situations where they might be sad, they will instead get angry.If your man has a reaction that confuses you, keeping this social conditioning in mind will help you understand his reaction. He has emotions, but he’s been taught not to show them, because it’s perceived as a sign of weakness.

, Men are often taught to suppress their emotions, which is not always the most productive way to deal with emotions. Suppressing emotions can create a disconnection between emotions and thoughts. This means that men might not even know what they’re feeling. It is important for men to work on expressing emotions because emotion suppression can lead to negative physical and psychological effects.Because of emotion suppression, your man might not be able to discuss how he is feeling. If he’s willing to work on this with you, realize that this will take practice and time.
Realize that suppressing emotions is not only a male trait. Women suppress emotions also. Women also need to work on expressing their emotions in productive ways. Just because women are thought to be better at expressing emotions, this doesn’t mean this is always the case. People are not born knowing how to express their emotions in meaningful and efficient ways. It’s a skill that needs to be learned for both men and women., Unlike that old saying, men are not from Mars and women are not from Venus. Men and women are much more alike than many people would like to admit. In fact, many scientists today prefer to discuss gender differences in terms of a broad continuum of possibilities, as opposed to a strict distinction between two straightforward options.It's important to avoid making assumptions about men and anticipate their behavior to conform to the gender roles and expressions you'd typically expect. Don't assume he likes sports, for example, or that he likes beer and hates ""chick flicks"", which are all common stereotypes about men. Rather, get to know the man in your life on an individual level as opposed to approaching him based upon what you think you know about men in general. After all, he's just a human being just like you and has his own thoughts, feelings, and beliefs.

, Try to understand where the particular man in your life is coming from when he does something that shocks or upsets you. Women also often feel pressure to conform to prescriptive roles about how women should behave and be feminine. Rather than write him off, perhaps show some empathy and understanding. In some cases, men don't even intend to subscribe to the male ego, but it just happens since they've been socially conditioned regarding how to act.


For example, if a man interjects in a conversation to say that he thinks professional women's sports aren't worth anyone's time, don’t just blame his comments on the male ego. Try to understand that he lives in a world where women's sports really are NOT valued as highly as those of men. In a lot of ways, this attitude isn't surprising; both men and women have been told by society that professional men's sports matter more than women's. The problem may not be with this individual man, but with society as a whole and how it talks about men, women, and gender roles.
Empathy can be an important step on the route to transformation. Once you empathize with how his behavior has been impacted by social expectations and norms, you can then begin to open the conversation to challenge that process. For example, perhaps broach the subject of why we don't value female athletes as much as male athletes in major sports. What types of social cues have led us to think women's sports don't matter as much, such as the news coverage, salaries, etc.?
This empathy can also come in the form of checking your own instant reactions to moments when your boyfriend, father, or other male friend or family member doesn't conform to gender stereotypes. For example, if he mentions that he really likes to go the ballet, your instinct based on conventional gender norms might be to consider that ""girly"" and not very manly. Instead, check those reactions and remember that you too might be part of the problem in validating the male ego.

, Studies have found that both men and women use humor as a way to complicate their identities as men and women, and experiment with the boundaries between them.But what is interesting is also how humor functions for men and women in terms of sustaining their particular gender roles in society. While some men might prefer making jokes that reinforce traditional gender stereotypes, such as those positioning women as inferior to them, other men might instead challenge those stereotypes by making fun of the way men have traditionally considered themselves superior. How a man jokes about his sense of masculinity and the conventional stereotypes that apply to men and women in his culture can tell you a lot about his personality and his willingness to conform to these stereotypes, many of which are outdated according to recent scientific research.If he makes a lot of sexist jokes that denigrate women and portray men as superior, you're going to have a harder time breaking down the male ego. The first step is to have a genuine discussion about the unfunny nature of those jokes and to ask him why he makes them. The hope is that he will realize that these jokes are not funny and that he only does it because everyone else does it too. Making men aware of their behavior and drawing attention to the things that they do that reflect almost unconscious motives can help them to be more conscious about what they say and do.

, The closer you become with a man, the more you will be able to separate the man's true self from the social expectations placed upon him. Keep in mind, however, that this might take some time, as most men will not be willing to open up right away. As with most relationships, forging intimacy takes time, whether it's with a love interest or friend. However, as your relationship progresses and you begin to delve into deeper topics about your interests and views on the world, he may be able to let some of those gender scripts go.


Talk and get to know each other. Share private details about your past, stories that give a sense of who you are, how you grew up, and what sorts of things made you the way you are today. Ask the man to reciprocate; you might be surprised by his honesty and how, over time, the layers of the macho male ego slip away to reveal his true colors. Maybe he will confess that he cried when watching The Notebook or that he hates all organized sports, things that are not traditionally associated with masculinity.
In other words, as he feels more trusting and open with you, he may be more forthright about some of the ways in which he is ambivalent about some aspects of the gender role he is supposed to embody. This will act as yet another avenue for more intimate communication.

, Gender role strain is the stress and anxiety related to a gender role when that role cannot be sufficiently or appropriately met. There are three main types:



Discrepancy Strain - When a person fails to meet typical gender norms. For example, perhaps a man is experiencing depression and decides to seek help. This is a discrepancy with the notion that ""men should tough it out.""

Trauma Strain - When a person experiences a traumatic life event during the process of being socialized into the appropriate gender. For example, perhaps the man is experiencing depression partly in relation to his ""man's man"" father who was very tough and taught him that ""boys don't cry"".

Dysfunction Strain - When a person fulfills a gender role that is dangerous or causes harm. For example, if the man doesn't seek treatment for his depression based on the idea that men don't need help, his depression will likely continue and perhaps even worsen.

, As a man, you may feel under great pressure to conform to ideals of masculinity. Movies, TV, magazines, and even the people around you all provide cues on how you should act and how a man should be. What happens, however, when your own sense of self doesn't line up with those expectations? What does this apparent inability to measure up do to your sense of self? Societal expectations of how to be a man can be harmful and leave you with low self-esteem and self-image.In some cases, the effects can be even more dire. Some men try to cope with this stress by engaging in unhealthy habits, such as substance abuse, escapism, and violence.


For example, eating disorders have been increasingly prevalent in men due to social pressures for men to have fit, athletic, and toned bodies. Men who don't fit this 'perfect' body type have feelings of low self-worth and in turn punish their bodies for not being perfect.Note that since self-reliance is typically part of the male ego, men often don't get the help they need.

, Because the social expectations of men are so high, men have to find a way to cope with the pressure. Most men cope with social expectations and gender role strain in one of three ways:



They change themselves to meet social expectations. Changing one's self identity is not easy, and in many cases men do this to realize the benefits of complying with social expectations. For men, these benefits are numerous, including acceptance from other men, increased self-esteem, and increased social status, among others.

They reject social expectations. In this case, men who do not conform to societal pressures can incur negative consequences, such as rejection from other men, lower status, and fewer social and romantic possibilities. For this reason, most men do not choose this option and instead find it easier to try to fit traditional gender norms and then cope with the discrepancy (and not always in a healthy way).

They shift social expectations. Thought this is the ideal option and what that can make a positive difference in our society, it's also difficult. Gender norms are deeply entrenched in our society and trying to shift those is no easy task. However, there have been successes in the past, as the growing acceptance of homosexuality and transgender individuals indicates.

, In general, men have few options related to gender expression. They really are pigeon-holed and the potential options listed above also do not sound very encouraging for many men. However, one thing a man can do to deal with social expectations is build on some of the strengths of that gender socialization. Some of the qualities of the male ego that can produce difficulties for men can also be resources and strengths.


For example, in a crisis or emergency situation and in some kinds of work, the ability to ""stay calm"" and ""keep a level head"" has great value. Such skills are useful in certain occupations from emergency room nursing to running a Fortune 500 company. These are also valuable life skills that help us to care and support for others as parents, friends, and community members.The main challenge here is to value some of the knowledge and skills that are part-and-parcel of the male ego without these becoming the only way we operate. For example, while it can be useful in some respects when men remain calm and don't let their emotions overtake them, in other situations it's important to show and work through emotion. So, try to embrace some of the strengths of the male gender role without subscribing to it wholeheartedly or uncritically., Remember that your gender identity can be whatever you want it to be. YOU get to choose. Perhaps you want to take certain aspects of that socially constructed idea of masculinity and reject other parts; maybe you will continue to love sports and wear pants and shorts (but not dresses), but you also opt to be the stay-at-home dad (a position generally assumed to be taken by the woman in the relationship).


You grew up and are enmeshed in the society in which you live. Even when you realize how much of who you are is based on social influences, this doesn't mean that you have to start over -- in fact, this is basically impossible since ideas about gender roles permeate all aspects of our society!
That said, being more aware about how gender is a social construct can make you a more conscious observer of your own thoughts and behaviors. You can incorporate those aspects of the male ego that you feel enhance yourself (such as being goal-driven or leadership), and reject those that harm your own well-being or that of others, such as the need to dominant others or view emotion as weakness.

, If you ever feel that the strain between who society tells you to be and who you are becomes too much and begins to adversely affect your mental well-being, then you should consider seeing a counselor. A counselor can help you to work through the issues that are bothering you, which may enable you to live a happier life.

Seek help.",How to Ignore Pain and Feelings," This technique helps relax the mind and the body.Imagine being somewhere you enjoy (a beach, on top of a mountain, surrounded by trees in the rainforest) and make the image in your mind as real as possible. Smell the air, observe your surroundings, and imagine planting your feet on the ground. Imagine being there with your body in perfect health. Spend as much time as you like in this experience, allowing yourself be transported there mentally.


When using guided imagery, you are in control. If you experience incredible pain, allow yourself in your guided imagery to fly. You are able to create any scene you desire.;
, When you experience pain, your senses can be out of balance with the focus on feeling. Consciously engage your other senses: listen to the sounds around you (the cars outside, a neighbor cutting the grass); smell the air or spend extra time smelling your food observe your surroundings with your eyes; feel the texture of your clothes against your skin. Remind your body that it can experience different kinds of stimuli outside of pain.Engaging your senses during extreme moments of pain can help shift your focus and balance your senses.

, This may seem counter-intuitive, but try to identify what it is you are feeling. Is the sensation hot, cold, burning, dull, localized or general? You may begin to experience the pain less as a permanent experience but more a changing of sensation.Be present with your experiences and in a state of observation.


By focusing on physical sensation and not on “pain”, you can change the way you experience these feelings.
Think of it as observing your body and not as experiencing pain. Changing your perception can help ease your mind and body from negative experiences. That way, it’ll be less likely to get stuck in the thought cycle, “I’m in so much pain.”

, The term “fake it til you make it” can even apply to pain. If in your mind you think things can only worse, don’t be surprised if you start to feel more pain. The more you believe you are capable of being pain-free, the more capable you will be.Say to yourself, “I am improving every day” and “I feel less and less pain.”
You can even say, “I do not experience the sensation of pain in my body” and “my body is functioning optimally.”

, Remind yourself that your body isn’t turning against you, and that it is not purposefully hurting you. Treat your body with love, kindness, and respect, especially because it is in pain. Your body isn’t purposefully causing you to suffer.Express love toward your body by treating it kindly, getting proper rest, and eating healthy foods to aid in recovery.

, You may want to consult with a pain specialist to address your chronic pain. Even if you prefer to “grin and bear it”, there may be non-prescriptive relief for the pain you experience, such as adjusting your posture or using a cushion or pillow.


Some pain may not go away, and in fact may get worse with time. Listen to your body and seek medical intervention when necessary.

, When experiencing pain, you may find yourself thinking, “this will never go away” or “I can’t endure this.”When you have these thoughts, you allow yourself to experience the emotional reactions that accompany these thoughts, such as feeling bad for yourself, uncomfortable, angry, or fearful.Practice re-programming your thoughts, and find that your emotions begin to change, too.


When you catch yourself in a negative thought, think of a different thought to replace it. Instead of thinking, “I am so miserable” think, “I am improving each day.”
Instead of thinking, “The pain is unbearable”, think, “ I can handle this pain and focus my mind elsewhere.”

, It’s easy to focus on what hurts, but choose to focus your attention to a part of your body that is fully functioning and healthy. Perhaps you observe your hands and fingers moving effortlessly, or wiggle your toes. Relax as you observe and feel these sensations, allowing them to the the dominant sensation you feel in your body. Even if pain feels overwhelming, this can remind you that your whole body is not in pain.You can even focus on the sensation of blinking your eyelids, how effortless it feels and how your body monitors this action on its own most of the time.

, Suffering is a mindset based on reliving the past, blaming others, or telling yourself that you are miserable.Remember that suffering is relative and based on an emotional experience, not physical surroundings. While you cannot choose to experience a pain-free life, you can choose how you respond to the pain.


Instead of thinking, “I have the worst luck ever”, say, “I’ didn’t chose this, but I will accept this situation and not feel bad for myself.”
Create a practice or a ritual that allows you to practice not suffering. You may choose a mantra to say to yourself any time negative thoughts come up, such as “I choose to respond to physical sensation without having to suffer.”
We spend most of our lives thinking it’s okay to suffer, so give yourself time to adjust to this new mentality. Realize that your mindset may not change overnight, and there may be days you want to feel sorry for yourself.

, Thinking positively helps you to live a happier, more stress-free life.Instead of focusing on the negatives in your life, focus on all that is positive. Focus on your recovery, the positive gains you are making, and the care you are receiving.


Don’t get trapped in polarized thinking, or seeing things as “all good” or “all bad”.if you blame yourself for your pain or for making bad decisions, remember that many factors influence each outcome. Allow yourself to say all sides, even the gray areas.

, While you may not like your present situation, you can accept what is out of your control. You can’t, for example, take away your pain or injury, but you can accept its role in your reality. While acceptance isn’t an easy practice, it helps you to diffuse stress and live with more peace.When pain and difficult feelings arise, take some deep breaths and say, “I do not enjoy what I am experiencing, but I accept that it is part of my life right now.”

, Don’t spend your time thinking about what you’re missing out on, or what you could be doing if you weren’t in pain. Instead, focus on adding happiness to your life in this moment. Happiness is often found in the little things, or when you “stop and smell the roses.”When your spirits are low, look for happiness in the small things: a nice text from a friend, a warm cozy blanket to wrap up in, or sweet cat snuggles at home.


Do things that bring you joy such as coloring, drawing, dancing, or playing with your dog.
When you start to feel negative, engage in something that brings you pleasure, even if it’s just sipping a cup of tea.

, You may find it difficult to find things to be grateful when you are in pain and feeling bad, but give it a shot. Gratefulness allows you to see beyond your current perceived negative experience and appreciate life from a wider vantage point.By being grateful, you can focus on more positive feelings and not on the pain or sad feelings.
Start a gratitude journal and write down the things you are grateful for each day. This can include having clean laundry, eating a delicious meal, or finding a sale on an item you really like.

, Did you know that smiling has the ability to boost your mood? By smiling, you can start to increase feelings of happiness, just like happiness causes you to smile.Even if you’re in pain and feel angry or upset, put a smile on your face and see if you start to experience the pain or negative emotions differently.


Connect with the sensations associated with smiling and start to feel happiness wash over you.

, Laughing relaxes your entire body, can improve your mood, and has mind and body benefits.You don’t have to search too hard to find things to make you laugh: watch funny tv shows or video clips, invite good natured friends over for a game night, or read a funny book.


Everyone has a different sense of humor, so do things that make you laugh, whatever they may be.

, Don't isolate yourself in a time of need, reach out to your friends! Surround yourself with happy people that naturally maintain a positive attitude.Choose to spend time with people who laugh easily, smile frequently, and whom you feel good when around.


If you are isolating, realize that isolation can contribute to feelings of depression. Contact with others is an important part of healthy living., If you feel like your pain is too great to ignore or work through on your own, get some help. Whether the help you seek be seeing a therapist or talking to a friend, determine what would be most helpful for you.


Remember that people love and care about you.
If you feel chronically unhappy and don’t feel like there’s hope, you may experience symptoms of depression. For more information, see How to Know if You Have Depression and How to Deal with Depression.

Ask if your high blood pressure is stage 1 or stage 2.,
Learn about the different types of methods for treating high blood pressure.,
Identify other medical conditions that could impact the effectiveness of your medication.,
Screen for organ damage as a result of high blood pressure.,
Try a high blood pressure medicine and monitor for possible side effects.",How to Choose Hypertension Medication,"


Once you are diagnosed with hypertension, you will be given either a stage 1 or stage 2 classification for your disease. Stage 1 high blood pressure is for individuals having a systolic (top) reading of 140 to 159 mm Hg and having a diastolic (lower) reading between 90 and 99 mm Hg. Stage 2 high blood pressure is diagnosed in a patient who usually has a systolic reading of 160 mm Hg or higher, and a diastolic reading of 100 mm Hg or higher.;
,


There are many possible medications for treating high blood pressure today, including calcium channel blockers, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, and angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Each medication works in a slightly different manner. For example, diuretics rid the body of excess water and sodium which lowers blood pressure. Beta-blockers work by lowering heart rate and cardiac output. ACE inhibitors reduce strain on the heart by helping blood flow more easily.
While diuretics are often the first course of action, a doctor may also prescribe an additional or replacement medication if the diuretic does not significantly lower blood pressure. Many patients may take a combination of medication to keep hypertension in check and reduce the risk of complications from high blood pressure.

,


For example, diuretics are not recommended for patients with diabetes, since these drugs can increase blood sugar levels in the body. Patients who have been diagnosed with angina along with hypertension might see greater results with a beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker. Your doctor needs to know your full medical history to find the best hypertension drug for you.

,


High blood pressure that remains unchecked for a period of time may result in organ damage, such as an enlarged heart, kidney or eye damage or weakened arteries. Your doctor will take this type of damage into consideration when treating high blood pressure, to ensure the medication prescribed does not risk further damage.

,


Most hypertension medications have a number of potential side effects, which vary from patient to patient. The choice of a drug is determined in part by a process of trial and error to see which medications the patient is able tolerate well.

Exercise regularly.,
Get enough sleep.,
Embrace your appearance.,
Work toward better posture.",How to Improve Body Image when You Have Chronic Pain1," Exercise with chronic pain can seem difficult, but low-impact or assisted exercises are often cited as a way for those with chronic pain to deal with discomfort as well as to gain a better self-image. Try low-impact exercises like walking, water aerobics, or restorative yoga three to four times a week for fifteen to thirty minutes at a time.Exercise benefits those with negative body image because even moderate exertion causes the body to release endorphins, which are proven to help people feel good in their own skin.Talk to your doctor if you before you try a new type of exercise if you suffer from a chronic condition. They can help you figure out which exercises may be beneficial or harmful for you.;
, Proper rest is important for both pain management and positive body image. Being well-rested helps decrease sensitivity to pain, which subsequently helps keep you from thinking an increased number of negative thoughts about your body due to your condition.It is recommended that adults get seven to nine hours of sleep a night.Children over the age of five should get between nine and thirteen hours a night depending upon their age.

, You may have limited options for controlling chronic pain, but there are a number of aspects you can control regarding your personal image. Set small, achievable goals for yourself such as gradually replacing old pieces in your wardrobe or wearing a statement piece each day that makes you feel fabulous.Think about what makes you feel both comfortable and put-together. You are going to achieve your best self-image by making yourself happy, not by adhering to fashion industry standards.
Remember to consider your pain as you set your goals. If skinny jeans compress your legs too much and trigger discomfort, for example, they might not be a good choice regardless of whether they are on trend.
As you achieve your goals, offer yourself regular mental praise as a reward. Let yourself know, “I look good in this new shirt.”

, As much as you are able, try straightening up your back and holding your head high. Good posture gives you a look of confidence and authority, and when practiced enough over time, it may help you become more confident overall.If your pain prevents you from having traditionally optimized posture, simply try holding yourself in a way that seems confident and self-assured to you. The results can still be the same.

Avoid depictions of unrealistic standards.,
Practice cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).,
Find something to laugh about.",How to Improve Body Image when You Have Chronic Pain2," Images of people in magazines, advertisements, and on social media are often cited as being unrealistic for anyone, as they are generally manipulated. This holds even more true for those with chronic pain, as these images are generally not meant to depict individuals coping with chronic conditions.Unfollow or unsubscribe to social media accounts and publications whose primary goal is to depict idealized physical forms of beauty.
Use social media as an outlet to stay in contact with friends and family, and select only publications with content that you find informative and mentally enriching.

, CBT is best undertaken with the assistance of a therapist, but there are a number of techniques you can use on your own if a therapist is not within your means. Focus on using positive statements and behaviors to directly oppose negative thoughts about your body.If, for example, you often find yourself thinking, “I must look unattractive when I am in pain,” respond to yourself by saying, “My pain does not define me. I may not be perfect, but I can be an intelligent, attractive, capable person while dealing with chronic pain.”
It is normal for positive thoughts to feel fake or unrealistic at first. CBT works slowly through repetition to retrain the brain so that negative thoughts are not your first instinct. Stick with it an over the course of months or even years and you will likely notice benefits.
If you have the means, work with a therapist that specializes in CBT. You can check online, with your insurance, or by directly calling clinics to see if CBT is offered in your area., Laughter, much like exercise, releases endorphins, which help with both pain management and improved self-perception. Try watching a TV show or movie that makes you laugh, or spend time with friends or family members whom you find positive and entertaining.Do not expect forced laughter to work. Endorphins are not triggered by noise of laughter, but instead are part of the chemical process that causes sincere laughter.

"

Spend less time monitoring your appearance.,
Join a support group.,
Talk to your doctor.",How to Improve Body Image when You Have Chronic Pain3," Generally speaking, those who spend less time monitoring their body to see if it conforms to current standards generally have a more positive body image. Avoid spending too much time in front of the mirror or on the scale while you are trying to improve your body image.Make pain management a priority over appearance every day. The better you feel about your body’s ability to cope with your pains, the better you will feel about your body overall.
You do not need to avoid things like mirrors or scales entirely. Rather, use them only when necessary. Use a mirror to fix your hair, for example, but don’t spend minutes or hours staring into it afterward.

, Finding a support group for people with the same or similar types of chronic conditions can not only help you feel supported, but also provide you with tips and techniques that have worked for others. Look online or talk to your doctor about finding a support group in your area for people with chronic pain.Support group meetings will focus on a number of issues, from pain management to work and personal life, as well as body image. Be ready to discuss a wealth of issues pertaining to your daily life.
Remember that you are there to offer support as well as receive it. Be calm and patient, and offer others your respect and attention when it is their turn to speak.

, If your chronic pain is severely impacting the ways in which you perceive your body, let your doctor know. They may be able to recommend alternative treatments such as therapy or meditation, as well work on adjusting any medication that may have negative mental side effects.Let your doctor know what you are thinking in as much detail as possible. Instead of telling them, “I feel bad about my body,” let them know, “My leg pain makes me feel like others are staring at me and mocking me because I have to walk slow.”

Try memory association.,
Build off of things you remember to do.,
Visualize things.,
Use repetition.,
Try new things.,
Listen to music.,
Use acronyms.",How to Improve Your Memory After a Stroke1," Sometimes it’s easier to remember something if you connect it to something familiar to you. This can help with certain kinds of memory loss from strokes. Make the association point something you already know and can easily remember.For example, connect dates you need to remember with dates you know. This can be a holiday, like Christmas or your birthday. You may remember you have an appointment two weeks before your birthday or a month after Valentine’s Day.
Connect people’s names to things you are familiar with. If someone you meet has the same first name as a famous person, use that as your association. Use details to help you remember what someone looks like and their name. For example, Billy with the blonde hair, Rachel with the red hair, or Ted who is tall.;
, If there are important tasks you can’t remember to do, try to pair them with things you remember to do. This can help you build the recognition of the task so you can start to commit it to memory.For example, if you always eat eggs or oatmeal in the morning, place a Post-it note on the egg carton or oatmeal container that reads, “Take your medicine” or “Feed the cat.”
You might also try placing items near other items you use every day. For example, if you use the television remote each day, place your pills or cat food beside the remote.

, Another way to help build your memory is to work on visualizing what you want to remember. To do this, create a picture in your mind of what you’d like to remember. Visualize yourself in a past memory. If you want to remember to do something later, visualize yourself doing the activity.When trying to remember to do something later, try adding odd details. This can help you remember better. For example, if you need to go to visit your friend, imagine yourself going to see them while wearing a weird outfit or while riding a horse instead of driving a car.

, You can try to process information and commit it to memory through repetition. Repeat the information over and over again. Write it down and read it multiple times. Do this multiple times a day for as long as it takes to learn the information.After you read or repeat the information, try to explain it to yourself by putting it in your own words. This is a different process in the brain that can help you learn information after studying it.

, Part of increasing your memory is improving cognitive function. To do this, you need to stimulate your brain. You can do this by trying new things that push your brain to learn new information and do new things.Try a new hobby the helps both your brain and your body. This may include painting, cooking, or gardening.
Physical activity can help stimulate your brain and improve function. Consider trying a new activity, such as tai chi, swimming, or nature walks.

, Music can help your brain in many ways. You have to pay attention, listen to the words, understand the emotional and literal meaning, and even remember what you’ve just heard. This all is done easily as you listen to music.


Try listening to music every day. A recent study found that stroke patients who listened to music each day over a period of two months had increased memory and attention.Music is also relaxing, which is good for your brain. Relaxing your brain can help improve healing and brain function.

, It may be helpful to use acronyms to trigger your memory. An acronym connects words with letters to form an easier to remember word. All you have to remember is the acronym letters instead of a full sentence.For example, if you need to go to the grocery store every Wednesday, you may remember SOW - Store Every Wednesday. If you are going to dinner with your children on Friday, you may remember DCF - Dinner Children Friday.

Write down important information.,
Create a routine.,
Get proper rest.,
Pay attention.,
Avoid pushing yourself too hard.",How to Improve Your Memory After a Stroke2," Writing down things you want to remember can help in multiple ways. Some people remember things if they think about them and write them down. Plus, if you write down the information, you will have it just in case you forget.Keep important information in one notebook. This can include phone numbers, names, dates, appointments, a list of things to do each day, medications you need to take, or foods you should eat.
Place this notebook somewhere you will remember. If you can’t remember where you place it, put it somewhere you will see it each day, like the kitchen counter or coffee table.

, Routines can help you improve your memory by repeating the same tasks every day. Your routine should include everything you need to do for your day, like what you do in the mornings, chores you need to do, and things you should do at bedtime.Write your routine in a notebook. Keep it posted on your refrigerator door. This helps you be able to figure out what your daily routine should be until you remember it.

, After a stroke, your brain has to heal itself. A stroke majorly affects your body, so you will have to take things slower than before. Getting enough rest ensures that you don’t overwork your brain. When you are well-rested, your focus and attention is better, which can help you remember things better.Take rests during the day when you need to. If that means doing less than you used to, that’s okay. Put your health first.
Get quality sleep at night. You should shoot for seven to nine hours each night.

, One of the first things you can do to help improving your memory is to pay attention to the things around you. Memory problems are often linked to inattention. For things to be committed to your memory, you need to pay attention to them.Start making yourself pay attention to things around you. Start with important things you want to remember, like an appointment or detail someone told you.
You can also try remembering unimportant things, like the color of shirt someone wears or what someone said on television.

, Recovering from a stroke is not easy. Though you may want to push yourself to get better quicker, that may not help. Be patient and be kind to yourself. If you get tired, take a break. Resting and letting your body and brain recover will help.


Don't be too hard on yourself or get frustrated if you don't remember everything immediately. Recovering your memory can be a long process. Keep working at it and managing it as you take care of yourself.
Be sure to ask for help from your family and friends when you need it. It is important to maintain good connections with your loved ones and to let them know how they can help you.

Talk to your doctor.,
Visit an occupational therapist.,
Consider a specialist.",How to Improve Your Memory After a Stroke3," If you are experiencing memory problems after your stroke, you should make an appointment with your doctor. Let them know what kinds of problems you hare having. The doctor will check to make sure there isn’t an underlying problem causing memory loss.If there is no underlying cause, your doctor will perform a cognitive assessment that will help gauge the scope of your memory loss.

, An occupational therapist can be very helpful when you are recovering from a stroke. They can help you learn coping strategies to deal with your impaired cognitive ability and work on techniques that can help improve your memory.They may help you cope by encouraging you to do things like writing down important things, using daily reminders, or leaving notes around your house.

, If your memory is not improving or your speech is affected, you may want to set up an appointment with a specialist. A neuropsychologist can help your with problems of cognitive function, concentration, and memory.A speech pathologist can help you recover verbal memory and communication skills after a stroke.

Learn about mouth ulcers.,
Steer clear of certain food and beverages.,
Treat tobacco related ulcers.,
Take care of yeast infections.,
Deal with ulcers caused by medications.,
Take care of general mouth ulcers.",How to Heal Mouth Inflammation1," A common cause of inflammation in the mouth is mouth ulcers. Mouth ulcers, also called mouth stomatitis, vary in size and shape and are caused from a variety of different factors. They can be caused from herpes (cold sores), canker sores, yeast infections, tobacco use, medications, fungal infections, injury, and some systemic illnesses.See your doctor or dentist for mouth sores that are painful and last for more than 10 day.;
, Ulcer inflammation is painful and can last five to fourteen days. Avoiding certain types of beverages and food can help to heal the inflammation, reduce your pain, and reduce the amount of time you suffer. In order to lessen irritation, avoid hot beverages and foods as well as foods that salty, spicy, or have citrus elements. These can increase the irritation to the mouth tissue.This includes hot coffee and tea, spicy red peppers, foods with cayenne pepper or chili powder, overly salted soups and broths, and fruits such as oranges and grapefruits.

, Ulcers from tobacco use are called aphthous ulcers, which is also known as a canker sore. These irritations can be healed by reducing or eliminating the use of all tobacco products. If you continue to use tobacco products, the sores may take longer to heal and continue to reappear.

, Yeast infections of the mouth can cause thrush to the tongue, which is when the fungus candida, the fungus behind vaginal yeast infections, occurs in the mouth. Thrush can cause an inflammatory response and pain in your mouth.Thrush can also cause mouth ulcers.Healing inflammation from a yeast infection will require medication from your physician.


These medications can be used in otherwise healthy adults and children for 10 to 14 days and come in lozenges, liquid, or pill form. However, children and adults with a weakened immune system require different help., Some medications, such as anti-cancer drugs, can cause mouth ulcers. These drugs kill the fast growing cells but do not specifically target cancer cells, which means they can also kill the cells in your mouth, which grow and replicate quickly. These sores are painful and can last for more than two weeks.


Sores from these medications may require topical painkillers applied directly to the mouth sores. These medication can also numb your mouth, so use caution when eating or brushing your teeth after you apply them., If you are not sure what causes your mouth ulcers, there are some general guidelines you can follow to ease your pain and discomfort. Other than the techniques used to treat and prevent certain kinds of ulcers, you can also:


Use coating agents to help protect the sores and minimize the pain you’ll experience while eating and drinking
Avoid sharp or crunchy foods, such as chips, crackers and pretzels
Limit or eliminate alcohol, which can irritate an already sore mouth. This applies to drinking alcohol as well as mouthwashes and mouth sprays.
Eat smaller meals more frequently and cut foods into smaller pieces, in order to reduce irritation to your mouth
Talk with your healthcare team about using special foam swabs that reduce the physical irritation if brushing is too difficult."
"
Take pain relievers.,
Treat ulcers with over the counter medications.,
Take prescription medication.",How to Heal Mouth Inflammation2," Over the counter pain relievers can help to reduce inflammation and pain from mouth ulcers. Try taking a pain reliever such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. These pain relievers will not necessarily heal your ulcers, but they can help to relieve pain caused by the ulcers while the ulcer heals.


You can also use topical products like Anbesol, which is applied locally for pain relief.
Use these products for children and adults as directed., There are multiple kinds of medicine that can help mouth ulcers. Topical corticosteroid preparations, such as triamcinolone paste or Orabase, can help treat sores on your lips or gums. Blistex and Campho-Phenique provide relief against the pain of canker sores and cold sores.


These work best if you apply them at the first sign of a mouth ulcer., If you have serious issues with your mouth ulcers, you can get medication from your doctor to help. Your doctor may prescribe medication such as Zovirax or Denavir, which can reduce the healing time of the ulcer by half a day. They also decrease the pain associated with the inflammatory response.


If you have a severe cold sore, your doctor may prescribe oral antiviral medications, which can be used to help heal the herpes simplex virus stomatitis that causes them. These include medications like acyclovir, valacyclovir and famciclovir."

Learn about gingivitis.,
Control the infection.,
Treat the infection.,
Learn about cavities.,
Treat the cavities.,
Care for teeth with braces.",How to Heal Mouth Inflammation3," Gingivitis and periodontal disease are irritations and infections of the gum tissue, which cause an inflammatory response and pain. Gingivitis occurs when plaque is not cleaned from your teeth. This causes harmful bacteria, which causes the gums to become red, swollen, and bleed easily. Periodontal disease can cause the gums to pull away from the teeth and form spaces or pockets that become further infected.


Bacterial toxins and your body’s natural responses can break down the connective tissue between the gums and bone, which cause inflammation and pain., The treatment of the inflammation caused by gingivitis or periodontal disease depends upon the severity of the inflammation. The main goal is to control the infection, which triggers the inflammation. Any treatment will require that you keep up good daily care at home, including:


Flossing daily
Brushing twice daily
Reducing alcohol intake and the use of mouth washes
Reducing the amount of sugar you eat, In order to help the infection, your dentist will remove any plaque through a deep cleaning, which helps to reduce the inflammation. After the procedure, you may experience less bleeding and swelling, but you will still have to continue good oral hygiene at home.


If the infection is advanced, your dentist may prescribe antibiotics to help reduce the infection, which will also reduce the inflammation.
If medications and cleaning are not sufficient your physician may recommend surgical procedures to clean the teeth closer to the root and help regenerate bone and connective tissue., Dental cavities are caused by infections that cause permanent damage to the hard surface of the teeth. Frequent snacking, drinking sugary drinks, not brushing your teeth, and the natural bacteria in your mouth increase your risk of cavities. Cavities and tooth decay are one of the world’s most common health problems and they affect people of all ages., The inflammation and discomfort caused by cavities cannot be healed until you fill the cavity. To treat cavities, your dentist will likely give you fillings. Fillings are made from tooth-colored composite resins, porcelain, or silver amalgam.


Silver amalgam fillings contain mercury, but they are considered safe by the FDA. However, if you have an allergy to any of the components of amalgam fillings (silver, tin, copper, or mercury), then you may develop oral lesions as a result. Tell your dentist about any allergies you have.If your tooth decay is advanced, you may need a crown. These are custom fitted fake caps that cover the tops of the teeth. A root canal may also be needed to repair or save a damaged or infected tooth, instead of removing it.
If the tooth is too damaged, pulling the tooth may be necessary. If you have to have it pulled, you may need a bridge or replacement tooth to keep your other teeth from shifting., Braces are used by orthodontists to straighten or correct teeth alignment. Braces have so many parts and often aggravate the mouth, and the brackets and braces can trigger the development of a canker sore in your mouth. To treat, rinse your mouth with warm salt water several times a day to reduce the inflammation and speed healing. Also try:


Eating soft foods to reduce the irritation to the tissue
Avoiding spicy foods, alcohol, mouthwashes, and sharp foods, like potato chips and crackers
Making a paste of baking soda and water and placing the paste over the canker sore."
"
Use water.,
Apply aloe vera.,
Suck on an ice cube.,
Use tea tree.",How to Heal Mouth Inflammation4," Extra hydration in your system can help with mouth inflammation, especially from canker sores. This will help relieve discomfort from the inflammation and fight off infection. You can also use water with salt to reduce the pain and speed healing in your mouth.


To use the salt water treatment, pour a generous amount of salt into a cup of warm water and stir to combine. Put some of the water in your mouth and swish it around, focusing on the area where the sore is. Spit the water out after a minute or so, and repeat with the rest of the water., Aloe has natural healing and anti-inflammatory properties. It contains saponin, a chemical which acts as an antibacterial agent. It is also known to soothe and relieve pain in inflamed areas.To use:


Get an aloe leaf and cut it open. Apply the gel that leaks out directly onto the area that is most inflamed. Do this three times a day for the best effect.
You can also get aloe vera gel that is specifically meant for your mouth. Again, apply the gel directly to the inflamed area. Do this three times a day for the best effect.
Avoid swallowing the gel if possible.

, Cold water and ice can help to ease your pain and reduce the inflammation in your mouth. It is the same concept behind icing a sore knee, because the cold temperature decreases the amount of blood cells flooding to the injured area, which decreases the swelling and pain.Ways to apply cold to your inflamed mouth include:


Sucking on an ice cube, popsicle, or sorbet
Drinking and gargling small sips of cold water
Putting ice cubes in a plastic bag and holding it on the inflamed area

, Tea tree oil has a natural antiseptic effect that helps kill bacteria. It can also help to control the infection and help in the healing process. This is especially useful with inflammation caused by gingivitis and periodontal disease. One of the most common ways to use tea tree oil for inflammation is as a mouthwash.


Make a mouthwash by adding 10 drops of oil in 1/3 cup of water. Swish this mouthwash around your mouth for 30 seconds and spit it out. Do not swallow the mouthwash. Rinse your mouth with fresh water afterward."

Prevent future cold sores.,
Inhibit yeast infections.,
Seek medical attention.",How to Heal Mouth Inflammation5," Cold sores need arginine to develop. Arginine is an amino acid found in foods such as walnuts, chocolate, sesame seeds, and soy.To prevent additional cold cores, avoid these foods. Instead, eat foods with the amino acid lysine, which counteracts the influence of arginine with cold sores. Foods high in lysine include red meat, pork, poultry, cheeses, eggs, and brewer’s yeast.Pay attention to your lysine to arginine ratio to help prevent the appearance of more cold sores in the future.


You can also take an oral supplement of lysine daily. Dosing will depend upon several factors, so discuss your intentions with your physician., You can help prevent yeast infections by brushing your teeth twice a day, flossing once a day, reducing or eliminating the use of mouth wash, and not sharing any eating utensils that may pass the infection from one person to another. If you have diabetes or wear dentures, take special care of your oral hygiene as these are possible triggers for a yeast infection.


Limit the amount of sugar or foods that contain yeast that you eat. Yeast requires sugar to multiply and grow. Foods with yeast include bread, beer, and wine, which can encourage the growth of yeast., There are situations when your mouth sore is more than a canker sore or cold sore. If they are persistent, the sores may be cancer, which is an uncontrollable growth of the cells that invade other areas and cause damage to the surrounding tissue.Oral cancer can occur on the tongue, lips, floor of the mouth, cheek, and the hard and soft palate of the mouth. This is life-threatening if undiagnosed and untreated.


Look for a lump or thickening of tissue in the mouth, a sore that doesn’t heal, a white or reddish patch in the mouth, tongue pain, loose teeth, difficulty chewing, jaw pain, a sore throat, and feelings of foreign objects stuck in your throat.Treatments to heal inflammation from this type of trigger requires the immediate intervention from a physician. Treatment protocols may include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation treatments."

Rest the area until it doesn’t hurt.,
Use a brace or a splint.,
Consult a physical therapist.,
Do appropriate exercises to ease sciatic pain.,
Apply capsaicin cream.,
Put on a lidocaine patch.,
Alter your habits when you’re pregnant.",How to Heal Nerve Pain1," The best remedy to heal a pinched nerve is rest. Avoid activities that aggravate the condition, and stop doing whatever activity caused the injury.Sciatic nerve pain is the most common type of pinched nerve. The pain can start in your buttock or back of your upper thigh and run down the length of your leg.
If you rest for 1-3 days and don’t notice improvement, consider getting evaluated by a medical professional.;
, You may need to use an assistive device to immobilize the area of your pinched nerve. This can help make sure you rest the area and allow the nerve to heal.Talk to your doctor about this, or request a referral to a specialist. Orthopedists specialize in bones, muscles, and nerve pain caused by muscle problems.


Carpal tunnel syndrome is nerve pain in the wrist caused by overuse. A wrist splint can help heal this kind of nerve pain.

, Pinched, stretched, and aggravated nerves can heal with rest and time – but it’s also important to prevent causing the same problem in the future. Ask your doctor for a referral to a physical therapist. They can teach you exercises to strengthen or stretch the muscles around the injured nerve. Do your exercises exactly as directed. Follow their advice on how to alter the activity that irritates the nerve., In addition to the exercises your physical therapist advises, you can also strengthen your body to alleviate pressure on your sciatic nerve. Ask your doctor or therapist about safe exercises to accomplish the following:Strengthen your core
Improve the strength of your back muscles
Increase your hamstring flexibility
Make your hips more flexible

, Capsaicin is found in hot peppers. Used in cream, it provides a warming sensation. Get capsaicin cream from your local drugstore or pharmacy. Rub it over the area where you have nerve pain on a regular basis.You might feel some burning when you apply the cream. This usually gets better over time, but stop using the product if you experience severe burning, itching, or a rash.

, Lidocaine numbs the area of your skin it touches. Get a lidocaine patch from your pharmacy and apply it as directed over your area of nerve pain to help alleviate the problem.It may cause some drowsiness or dizziness.

, Sciatic pain is common during pregnancy. If you have burning nerve pain down the back of your leg, it may be caused by pressure on your sciatic nerve from the developing baby. Try to modify your lifestyle and movements to alleviate pain; it should resolve once you deliver the baby.Lie on your side opposite the side that hurts. For example, if your nerve pain is in your left leg, lie on your right side.
Avoid heavy lifting.
Try not to stand up for long periods of time.
If you have pain while standing, lift one foot and rest it on something.
Try swimming regularly.
Put cold packs or heating packs on the sore area.

Start with weight loss to treat a spinal cord compression.,
Try electrical stimulation.,
Have the disk surgically repaired.",How to Heal Nerve Pain2," A herniated disk in your spine or spinal stenosis can squeeze your spinal cord, causing nerve pain throughout parts of your body. Where the pain is located depends on where your spinal cord is squeezed.If you have a herniated disk or spinal stenosis, try to reach and maintain a healthy weight.Sometimes, just losing some extra weight through a healthy diet low in fat and sugar can somewhat improve your pain.

, Talk to your doctor or a physical therapist about electrical stimulation for your nerve pain. This can be especially helpful for nerve problems due spinal issues or diabetes. Use a TENS machine (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) 30 minutes a day for a month to see if your nerve pain improves., In severe cases, you may need surgery to heal your nerve pain. A spinal surgeon may be able to fix your injured vertebrae, relieving pressure on your spinal cord and improving your nerve pain. Talk to your doctor about your options – you will need x-rays and probably a CT or MRI to know if surgery is right for you.Surgery may also help for severe carpal tunnel syndrome or pinched nerve pain that doesn’t resolve after months of conservative treatment."

Treat HIV neuropathy with medication.",How to Heal Nerve Pain3," Diabetes is a leading cause of nerve pain, especially in your hands and feet. If you have high blood sugar, work closely with your doctor or diabetes nurse to control it. You may be able to prevent or minimize nerve pain by appropriately managing your diabetes.Ask your doctor to test your blood sugar if diabetes runs in your family. Making diet and lifestyle changes are the safest and easiest ways to prevent nerve pain from diabetes.

, Shingles is the illness that you can get if you’ve ever had chickenpox – the virus lives in your nerves and can reactivate later in life, causing burning nerve pain.If you have shingles, see your doctor. They can prescribe medication to help alleviate your symptoms. Shingles will resolve over time, and usually your nerve pain will go away.


Your doctor may give you antiviral medication to speed up healing time. They may also give you a medicine to make your pain more manageable.
Shingles looks like a rash of blisters that occurs in a straight line, causing pain, itching or burning. It usually occurs on only one side of your body, and usually is located over your ribs – though it can occur anywhere on your body or face.
If you’re over 60 years old, get the varicella zoster vaccine (Zostavax). This can help prevent shingles.

, Herpes is a virus that lives in your nerves, so flare-ups can cause nerve pain. Talk to your doctor about taking acyclovir or another antiviral medication to prevent and treat herpes outbreaks., Some chemotherapy drugs to treat cancer can injure your nerves and cause nerve pain.Ask your doctor about using amino acids such as acetyl-l-carnitine to improve this kind of nerve pain.Nausea and vomiting are possible side effects.

, Many HIV patients suffer from chronic nerve pain. This pain usually shows up initially as a tingling sensation or numbness in the hands and/or feet. Talk to your doctor about taking antidepressents, analgesics, or anti-seizure medications to reduce nerve pain caused by HIV."
"
Ask your doctor about taking anti-seizure medications.,
Discuss using carbamazepine for facial nerve pain.,
Talk to your doctor about taking an antidepressant.,
Try pain medications.,
Get a corticosteroid injection.,
Try medical marijuana if it’s legal in your state.",How to Heal Nerve Pain4," Anti-seizure medicines (anticonvulsants) are often the first treatment choice for some types of nerve pain. Ask your doctor about your options. Gabapentin (Gralise, Neurontin) and pregabalin (Lyrica) cause fewer side effects than older medicines, but can still cause dizziness and drowsiness.Anticonvulsants are most commonly used to treat neuropathy caused by diabetes, herpes, and injuries to your spinal cord.

, Carbamazepine (Carbatrol, Tegretol) is an anti-seizure medication commonly prescribed to treat some types of nerve pain.Talk to your doctor about whether this medication is safe and appropriate for you to take. It can cause side effects like headache, nausea, and liver damage.


Carbamazepine is especially useful in a nerve problem called trigeminal neuralgia. This causes searing nerve pain on one side of your face.

, Some antidepressant medications may improve nerve pain, so discuss your options with your doctor. Amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and doxepin may improve pain. They can cause side effects such as dry mouth, blurry vision, constipation, and a hard time urinating.For nerve pain in your hands and feet caused by diabetes, Cymbalta or Effexor XR may help.

, For mild nerve pain, over-the-counter pain medicine may help. Try a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) like ibuprofen (Advil) or naproxen, or acetaminophen (Tylenol). Talk to your doctor or pharmacist first if you have any medical conditions that affect your kidneys, liver, or stomach. For severe pain that is not relieved by OTC medicine, ask your doctor for a referral to a Pain Management specialist. They may prescribe you stronger medication, like Tramadol or Hydrocodone.Opioid pain medications should only be used for a short time. They can become addictive., Depending on the location and cause of your nerve pain, an injection with a corticosteroid may help. This relieves inflammation and can calm pain. Ask your doctor about this if you have a pinched nerve.It isn’t helpful for nerve pain caused by medical conditions like diabetes.


You may also be able to take a steroid pill, but this causes far more side effects.

, Studies have proven that in many cases, neuropathy may be relieved by medical marijuana.If it’s legal in the state you live in and other treatment options haven’t worked for you, consider asking your doctor about taking medical marijuana to ease your nerve pain."

Recognize the warning signs specific to your condition.",How to Handle Excruciating Pain," Experiencing pain is stressful, especially if the source of the pain is unknown. Feeling anxious, panicky, and fearful can actually make the pain worse. Shallow breathing can lead to hyperventilation, impair the ability of getting oxygen into the blood, and lead to more pain, like chest and muscle pain.Try not to focus on the pain. Focusing your thoughts and energy on the pain you are feeling can actually make it worse. Try to relax and focus on other things. For example, think about the next steps you need to take to address the problem causing the pain.;
, Take slow, deep breaths that come from your belly or diaphragm, as opposed to shallow breathing from your chest. This helps to improve the flow of oxygen in your blood, and helps to quiet the intensity of the pain.Controlled breathing techniques are known to be effective in managing severe pain. Breathing techniques have been used for many years to help control the pain of childbirth., Pain may be lessened by sitting in an upright and straight position, or possibly by lying down. Find a position that helps to reduce the pain so you focus on locating the cause of the pain., Sudden onset pain, known as acute pain, is usually a warning sign. The pain is telling you to pay attention. Some common causes for acute pain include broken bones, sprains or strains, minor scrapes and cuts or deeper lacerations, muscle cramps, burns, or a broken tooth.Acute pain is considered to be classified as nociceptive pain. The pain from stepping on a nail or touching a hot stove falls in the category of nociceptive pain., In some cases, the sudden onset of severe pain may be the only warning you get that something is terribly wrong. For example, sudden onset abdominal pain may indicate a ruptured appendix, peritonitis, or a ruptured ovarian cyst. Ignoring sudden onset pain can lead to serious, sometimes life-threatening outcomes, if the need for prompt medical attention is ignored., Once you have identified the cause of the pain, take steps to correct the problem if possible. Acute pain gets better, and can go away completely, once the reason for the pain has been resolved.


Taking action to control the cause of the pain may include seeking medical attention. For serious injury or lingering, unexplained pain, medical professionals can help identify the problem and provide treatment options.
Situations involving acute pain can last for a few minutes, or can linger for several months. Acute pain that goes unattended can turn into long term, or chronic pain., Managing pain requires a commitment to learn new techniques, and to practice what you learn.

, Meditation is a proven and powerful way to address problems with pain. Learning to meditate requires instruction and a positive attitude to stick with it. Studies show that pain intensity can be reduced from between 11% to 70%, and the unpleasantness associated with pain from 20% to 93%., Studies have shown that focusing on a favorite food can help to lower the feelings of pain. Focusing on chocolate is a big favorite., Chronic pain wants your attention. Focusing on other things, like watching a movie, enjoying activities with friends and family, reading, or starting a new hobby causes your thoughts to focus elsewhere. Simply focusing on other body parts also takes away from the attention going towards the feelings of pain., Try to picture what your pain looks like, maybe imagine an arthritic joint, a pinched nerve in your neck, or the broken bone in your foot. Then imagine, or visualize, the area healing, or shrinking, or being less inflamed.Part of visualization also includes allowing yourself to mentally escape. Float away in your mind to a relaxing and restful place or a favorite past experience., Chronic pain is difficult to deal with since it is always with you and can constantly eat away at your positive attitude. Allowing your thoughts to become negative, dwell on the pain, and increase your feelings of frustration can actually make the pain worse. Try to stay positive and avoid imagining the worst.Consider talking to a counselor or therapist if you find yourself descending into negativity or becoming depressed due to your chronic pain.

, Mild pain relievers are available without a prescription. Products such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, aspirin, and even some topical patches can provide some relief.Use OTC products with caution. Do not exceed the recommended daily dose, and read the label to know of possible side effects from their use. Plus, if you have prescription pain medications, your doctor may not want you to supplement with OTC products due to added risks for complications.Check with your doctor before adding OTC meds to prescription pain control regimen.

, Understanding more about your condition can help with choosing the techniques best suited to your needs.


Chronic pain can sometimes involve neuropathic changes, or nerve damage, that make it harder to treat. Knowing more about your condition can help to choose techniques that can provide some relief and avoid further damage., Treatments may be available to help manage changes in your condition. Treatment of pain should always first be directed toward identifying and treating the underlying cause before just symptom relief.


If you have not seen a doctor about your pain, and your pain has been persistent, medical attention is warranted.

, Prescription pain medications are stronger than over-the-counter products, and are available in oral forms as well as topical products. These products often contain controlled substances that can be addictive, such as opiates. Some prescription opiate-free products are available, such as anti-inflammatory agents and tramadol.Older antidepressant agents, called tricyclics, some anticonvulsant drugs, and muscle relaxers are commonly prescribed to help manage chronic pain conditions. These agents work in different ways to control pain signals sent to and from the brain, and to relax muscle tissue surrounding the painful areas.Prescription only patches are also available. Some are applied directly over the painful area, these typically contain active ingredients like lidocaine, and some are applied anywhere that allows the medication to be absorbed into your bloodstream, like patches that contain fentanyl., In addition to prescription pain medications, many procedures are available that are designed to treat conditions involving pain. Physical therapy, nerve blocks, localized anesthetics, acupuncture, electrical stimulation, or even surgery may improve your pain.Chronic pain symptoms are sometimes controlled by using nerve block injections that are performed as an outpatient. Let your doctor know if you are allergic to contrast dye, which is commonly used during the procedures.
Depending on the site of the injection, common side effects include temporary numbness and soreness in the area of the injection site. Some procedures can result in droopy eyelids, temporary stuffy nose, and temporary difficulty swallowing., For some types of chronic pain, stimulating the nerves in the area can help to reduce painful symptoms. A TENS unit, or transcutaneous electro-nerve stimulator unit, uses small pads that are placed near the area of the pain. This device is controlled manually by the patient., Chronic pain affects people of all ages, involves practically every part of the body, and includes hundreds of diseases. Keep in touch with your doctor. Follow your doctor’s advice if your symptoms worsen."

Ask the child what they did that day.,
Keep a log of your child’s symptoms.,
Be able to give the doctor a thorough history.,
Take the child for diagnostic testing.,
Calm the child during testing.",How to Handle Pediatric Hip Pain1," Watch how the child walks and notice if they have a limp or refuse to put weight on one leg.Measure both of their legs from the hip to the bottom of their foot while it’s flexed, and notice if one leg is shorter than the other. Feel their leg muscles to see if one leg is atrophied (the muscle is smaller and weaker), which can suggest they’ve avoided using that leg due to pain. Ask if they have pain anywhere else – children often feel pain from their hip in their knee, thigh, groin, or back.Younger children may demonstrate hip pain by refusing to walk, walking on their tiptoes or with their toes turned outward, or crying while walking or moving.Infants may demonstrate signs of pain by being fussier than usual.;
, The most common cause of hip pain in children is transient synovitis, which is an inflammatory reaction that generally occurs after having a cold or other respiratory infection.However, hip pain sometimes occurs as a symptom of a more widespread problem. If your child has hip pain, pay attention to whether they have – or have ever had – any of the following problems that may indicate a systemic illness:Recent weight loss or failure to gain weight appropriately
Pallor (paleness and/or sweating)
Fatigue and excessive tiredness
A red rash that looks like a bullseye, which can indicate Lyme's disease
Changes in bowel habits (diarrhea, constipation, going more or less often)
Pain in other joints

, Hip pain can be caused by injury to the hipbone, leg bone, muscles, tendons, or ligaments. If the child is old enough to tell you, ask them what they did that day and listen for activities that could have caused injury – playing sports, jumping off a swing, getting into a fight, etc.

Hip pain can be caused by physical injury such as a broken leg (femoral fracture) or muscle strain., Because hip pain can be due to so many different causes, keep track of any associated signs or symptoms they have. This can help your doctor understand and diagnose the problem. Pay attention to and write down the following information:Does the pain occur all the time? Only at night? Only after exercising or sitting for a while?
Does anything relieve the pain, such as pain medicine or stretching?
Did the pain occur suddenly or gradually?
Does the child have stomach or abdominal pain? Back pain?
Does the hip pain cause pain in other places like the knee, thigh, or groin?
Does the child have a fever or chills? This is especially important because it can indicate osteomyelitis or septic arthritis - potentially life-threatening infections.
Is the hip red, warm, or swollen?
Have you recently been camping or hiking somewhere the child may have gotten bitten by a tick? They may be at risk for Lyme's disease.

, You must be able to give your child’s doctor a thorough history of the child’s medical history and recent past. Be able to tell your healthcare provider the following:If there’s been any recent accident or trauma
If the child has recently been sick with a virus
If the child has a family history of hip problems
If the child has a diagnosed condition, such as sickle cell anemia or rickets
What medications the child takes

, Pediatric hip pain must be diagnosed. It can be caused by joint and muscle problems, infection, inflammation, other illnesses, and cancer. Your doctor will do a thorough history and exam of the child and likely perform some tests, including x-ray, ultrasound, CT, MRI, blood tests, and more specialized tests if needed. They can treat the problem once they know what caused it., Reassure the child that the doctor wants to help take their pain away. Keep them company throughout testing and provide pleasant distractions, such as reading or singing, during stressful tests. Give them warm physical contact."

Massage the area.",How to Handle Pediatric Hip Pain2," Purchase ibuprofen, an over-the-counter pain reliever that eases discomfort and reduces inflammation.Give the medication as directed by your doctor or pharmacist, or as written on the label. For younger children, children’s Tylenol is a good option for pain relief. Whether or not to give the children's version of the medication depends on your child's age, so consult your doctor or pharmacist.

Do not try to manage hip pain only with OTC medication – take the child to the doctor for a diagnosis. OTC pain management is appropriate once approved by your doctor.
Never give aspirin to a child or teenager, due to the risk of Reye's Syndrome, a serious and potentially life-threatening condition in children., Ice can help to reduce inflammation and relieve pain. Put an ice pack or bag of frozen vegetables on the child’s hip. Wrap the ice in a thin towel to avoid causing damage to their skin.Keep ice on for 20 minutes. You can do this several times per day.

, Put a heat pack or warm water bottle on the child’s hip. This can help improve motion and reduce pain. They can also soak in a hot bath or shower.Heat can be especially helpful before the child performs stretching or strengthening exercises.

, Gently massage the child’s hip to help relieve pain. Tenderly kneed the affected area with your fingers or palms.Ask your doctor whether it’s okay to do this. Some hip problems will benefit from being left alone.

Schedule a follow-up appointment.",How to Handle Pediatric Hip Pain3," You cannot know whether your child’s hip pain is caused by a benign condition or a serious infection without taking them to the doctor. If the child does have an infection of their joint or bone, it can be a medical emergency. Check the child into the hospital so they can receive IV (intravenous, or into the vein) antibiotics to prevent destruction of the bone and other serious problems.If your child has hip pain and a fever (101°F/38°C or higher), take them to the hospital right away., As long as your child is having hip pain, keep them out of strenuous activities. Rest is often important in healing the problem causing hip pain. Allow them to gradually increase their level of activity starting two weeks after their pain is resolved.Swimming is a great activity to improve strength and range of motion after a period of rest.
Show them how to avoid bending at the waist and how to avoid putting direct pressure on their hip.Your child may need to use crutches for a while to give their hip some rest., Your doctor may give your child exercise instructions to help strengthen or stretch the joint to prevent further problems.

, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications prevent the body from making the chemicals that cause inflammation. Common medications include:Aspirin (Anacin, Ascriptin, Bayer, Bufferin, Excedrin). Do not give aspirin to children under 19.
Ketoprofen (Orudis)
Ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil, Nuprin, Medipren)
Naproxen sodium (Aleve)
These medications can be effective for reducing pain due to osteoarthritis, muscle aches, backaches, tooth problems, gout, menstrual cramps, joint pain due to fever, or headaches.

Consult a doctor if you are on other medications that might interact.

, The doctor can prescribe treatment to help you heal and medications to reduce your pain.


See a doctor for physical injuries like sprains, broken bones, or deep cuts. The doctor can bandage it, put a cast on it, or sew up the cut so it will heal properly. If you need prescription strength painkillers, your doctor can prescribe them.
Get medical attention if you have a serious infection. This includes severe respiratory infections like pneumonia or bronchitis, infections of the ears or eyes, sexually transmitted diseases, severe abdominal pain that may be indicative of an abdominal infection, etc. The doctor will prescribe strong antibiotics. You will feel better as soon as the antibiotics start killing the infection.

, If nothing else works and you still have severe pain, your doctor may prescribe more powerful drugs like morphine or codeine.These medications are addictive. Use them only as prescribed.

, These shots are usually given directly into the painful joint. They usually contain a corticosteroid and local anesthetic.This can be effective for conditions such as gout, arthritis, lupus, carpal tunnel syndrome, tendinitis, and others. Because these shots can damage the cartilage in the joint, they are only given, at most, three or four times a year., Why it works isn’t fully understood, but these medications may increase the chemicals in your spine that decrease pain signaling.It may take a few weeks before they provide relief.
They can be helpful for treating arthritis, nerve damage, pain from spinal injuries, pain from strokes, headaches, back pain, and pelvis pain.
The antidepressants most frequently prescribed for pain are the tricyclics.

, When you are still, your body can direct more energy to healing. Give your body time to heal by getting enough sleep each night. Try to get at least eight hours of uninterrupted sleep.Abstain from strenuous exercise like jogging while your body heals.
Avoid emotionally stressful events. The physiological changes your body goes through when you are stressed can slow the healing process.

, If your doctor feels that this would be helpful, he or she may be able to recommend someone who specializes in treating your condition. Physical therapy can help you use exercises to:Strengthen weak muscles
Increase your range of movement
Heal after an injury
This is often effective for musculoskeletal, neuromuscular, cardiopulmonary and other conditions.

, Pain can induce anxiety, stress, depression, and anger, all emotions which can cause physical changes in your body, like muscle tension. Try relaxation techniques to calm yourself. Methods include:Progressive muscle relaxation. Go through your body one muscle group at a time and slowly tense and then relax it.
Visualization. Concentrate on picturing a relaxing location.
Deep breathing
Meditation

Do not run right after eating.,
Do not drink too much liquid directly before a run.,
Strengthen your core muscles.,
Warm up before you run.,
Take full, deep breaths as you run.,
Take it easier down steep hills.",How to Get Rid of Side Aches when Running1," The up-and-down jolting impact associated with running stretches certain ligaments around the diaphragm (also referred to as gut tugs). This stretching is one possible cause of side stitches.Eating shortly before a run adds more weight and matter to tug at and stretch those ligaments, which can cause cramping.Avoid full meals at least two hours (and up to four hours depending on your experience with the cramping) before a run.Also, avoid even small food items starting one hour before you run.;
, Though staying hydrated is essential to avoiding muscle cramping while running, drinking too much can have the opposite effect. Fluids sloshing around can lead to tugging on ligaments the same way that food can. Studies have shown that drinking large amounts of any drink—from water to sports drinks to soda—before a run can lead to side cramping.However, the intensity of the cramping increases with heavier, sugary drinks, including soda and fruit juices., This is a long-term step toward alleviating side stitches, but strengthening your abdominal and lower back muscles will tighten up your core in a way that may decrease the ligament stretching responsible for the cramping.Planks and pushups are great exercises for tightening core muscles.For information on strengthening your core muscles, visit How to Strengthen Your Core.

, The way you breathe during a run has an effect on your diaphragm and the ligaments that can lead to cramping. A warmup that allows you to increase your running speed gradually helps you control your breathing in a way that may minimize the risk of cramping.Start with a brisk walk before your run and then work up to a jog, and then begin running. For more info on proper warm-up exercises before running, take a look at How to Warm up for Running.
Unless you’ve done a warmup before running in cold conditions, you’re more likely to breathe erratically during the initial portion of your run., Short, shallow breathing keeps the diaphragm in a higher position and that puts more stress on the connective ligaments.By taking deeper breaths, you lower your diaphragm in a way that can decrease the risk of cramping.Try to remain mindful of your breathing during your run.

, As your momentum increases down a steep hill, you make harder impacts with each step, which increases the gut tugging responsible for diaphragm spasms. Try jogging down especially steep hills rather than going full force."
"
Slow down your pace.,
Take several rapid deep breaths.,
Tighten your abdominal muscles.,
Tighten a belt around your waist.,
Hold the area beneath the pain firmly.",How to Get Rid of Side Aches when Running2," You probably won’t want to keep going at full speed with a cramp regardless, but slow down your pace when a cramp comes on.The lower impact of the slower pace will immediately reduce the up-and-down tugging and ligament stretching behind the cramp.

, For the same reason that deep breathing can help prevent cramping, it can also help alleviate cramps once they start. Quickly take in a deep breath, which will force down your diaphragm and relieve the stress on the surrounding ligaments.Hold the breath for several seconds, then exhale with force through pursed lips.Repeat several times until the cramp goes away.

, If deep breathing alone doesn’t help alleviate the pain after several seconds, try bending over—which can help you expel each breath more fully—and tightening your abdominal muscles as you do.These combined actions can help reduce the stress on your diaphragm even further to stop the cramping.

, While not particularly helpful during a run away from home, tightening a belt around your waist has also proven helpful in stopping pain related to side stitches.Try this if you have a home treadmill or remember to bring a belt to the gym with you.

, If you don’t have a belt handy, simply try using your hand to firmly grasp the area on your waist below the pain.Side stitches are almost always on one side of the body (typically right) with the pain centered just below the ribcage. As you exhale, pinch this area between your thumb and fingers, and then relax your grip as you inhale.This may not work as effectively as a belt, but combined with deep breathing, it should alleviate the cramp in five or six breaths."

Sleep in certain positions and don’t use constrictive bedding.",How to Get Rid of Extreme Back Spasms in the Morning1," If a back spasm wakes you up, give yourself a few minutes to wake up and get out of bed. A back spasm can be jarring, painful, and may even make you slightly dizzy, so allowing yourself to take it slowly may help relieve your symptoms. If you find it difficult to get up, follow this procedure:


Lie on your back and keep your knees bent.
Rotate your body to the side, so that you are lying on your side with your knees still slightly bent.
Slowly bring your legs off the bed and push yourself up with your bottom arm, making sure your body moves in one fluid motion.
Place your feet on the ground and use your hands to push off the bed. Make sure that you go slowly.;
, If you have a spasms or cramping in your back stretch it out. There are a couple of simple stretches that may help alleviate the spasm.Simply bending over and touching your toes may help.If you cannot stand up, you can do this same stretch while seated. Sitting with your legs outstretched and simply bending forward will have the same effect.Don't strain against the tension of spasm. Instead, stretch as you are able. Only increase the stretch as the cramping releases.
You might want to walk around in between stretching to help relax your back.
You can lightly massage your back as you stretch, too.

, Gentle exercising can help stretch out your back. General movement will naturally stretch the muscles and also help relax you, but you can also consider other exercises such as yoga.


Only exercise or undertake activities if you are able to and don’t push yourself. This may only be possible after some light stretching.
Gentle walking is a good way exercise to help stretch out your back. Take long strides to make sure that you’re using the entire muscle.Depending on what time of morning your spasms strike, either walk around your house or you could walk around the block.
Try doing gentle yoga, which will also help stretch out the muscle. Restorative and yin yoga are specifically practiced to help stretch out and repair muscles., Massage is one of the most effective ways to get rid of a spasm because it increases circulation to the tissues of the muscle. Combined with stretching, massage can quickly alleviate the pain of a back spasm while simultaneously relaxing you.Massage your back where the muscle is cramping. Press the area gently with your hands and apply more pressure if it doesn’t hurt.
Consider using a tennis ball to help relieve your pain. You can place the ball between your back and a wall or your chair and gently move back and forth to give yourself a massage.
A foam roller is another effective way to massage your back. These circular pieces of foam allow you to roll out the affected muscle by applying pressure. If you use a foam roller on your low back, make sure that you use it on one side of your low back at a time. Lying directly on a foam roller can hyperextend your joints.

, Using heat on a back spasm can be an extremely effective way to not only relax the muscle contraction and you, but also to relieve the pain. From heating pads to warm baths, there are many different heat treatments to help get rid of back spasms.Taking a warm shower or bath will relax you and help relieve the pain of a muscle cramp. The heat from the water can also help promote blood flow to the submerged area.A shower will also work if you don’t have a bathtub.
You can also try stretching out your low back while you are in the shower. Sit on a stool in a bathtub or shower, with the shower head pointing at your back. While sitting, slowly lean forward, stretching your low back as the hot water helps to release the tension.
Using Epsom salts in a warm bath may also help relieve cramping.Fill hot water bottle or get a heating pad and place it on the area of your back that is spasming.
Over the counter heat rubs may also help relieve back spasms and relax the affected area.

, Place something cold or cool on your back. This can help relieve pain.Use an ice pack as often as necessary for 20 minutes at a time.Wrap a bag of frozen vegetables in a dishtowel. The frozen vegetables conform to the shape of the back and may be more comfortable than an ice pack.
If it is too cold or your skin gets numb, remove the pack. Use a towel between the ice pack and your skin to help prevent frostbite., Deep breathing exercises, sometimes called pranayama, can naturally help dissolve the tension and tightness in your back that is causing the spasms.Do a few deep breathing exercises to help relieve the spasm and your pain.


Deep breathing can help your body distribute oxygen to your body, which can help ease cramps and back pain. Inhale and exhale completely and in a balanced manner through your nose. For example, you would inhale for 4 breaths, hold for 2 counts, and then exhale completely for four breaths. You can vary the counts according to your abilities.You want to get the most out of your deep breathing, so sit upright, with your shoulders back, and refrain from slouching. Breath slowly and evenly by focusing from your stomach, pulling in your belly to expand you lungs and rib cage., Studies have shown that low levels of potassium, calcium and magnesium can cause muscle spasms. Having a small or breakfast may help minimize the spasm.Sources of potassium are bananas and oranges.
Brown rice, almonds, and avocados are good sources of magnesium.
Dairy products and spinach are good sources of calcium.

, Although studies have not shown a connection between dehydration and muscle spasms, there is some evidence that not consuming enough water does contribute to this involuntary cramping. Having something to drink may help minimize the cramping that occurs as a result of being dehydrated while you sleep.You don’t need to drink anything more than a glass of water. If you prefer sports drinks or juices, try drinking them in conjunction with some water.

, For most back spasms, the best initial treatment is rest. Too much movement may exacerbate the cramping. Give yourself some time to rest to help relieve and prevent back spasms.Keep in mind that “rest” is not equivalent to being totally bedridden. You can go to the bathroom, take a shower, and sit briefly on a chair. Simply aim to spend most of your time in a comfortable position – which will vary depending on the site of your injury. Try to get out of the rest position once every hour for at least for a minute or two or for as long as you can.

, Sleeping in some positions and having a tightly made bed can exacerbate the tendency for muscle spams. By loosening your covers and sleeping on your back or side, you may avoid back spasms in the morning.Using a flat sheet on your bed can constrict your movement, so consider sleeping without one.
Sleeping on your side with your knees bent is the best position to help avoid getting thigh cramps.If you sleep on your back, place pillows under your knees to help keep the normal curve of your spine.It’s advisable to not sleep on your stomach because it can be hard on your back and neck. If you are unable to sleep in any other position, you can reduce the strain by putting a pillow under your pelvis and lower abdomen. Not sleeping with a pillow under your head may also help reduce strain."

Rest
Ice
Compression
Elevation;
, The first thing you should do if you think you have a pulled thigh muscle is to stop whatever activity you are doing. Continuing to work out or use a pulled thigh muscle can cause more damage. You should rest your leg from any physical activity that requires the use of your thighs. You should rest the muscle for at least one or two days.Take the weight off your leg as soon as possible. Sit down or lie down in as comfortable position as possible.

, The next step is to apply an ice pack to your injured thigh. Applying cold to an injury helps reduce blood flow, which can help alleviate pain. This also reduces acute swelling and inflammation.Apply it for 10 to 15 minutes at a time every hour during the first 24 hours of the injury, except for when you’re sleeping.
After the first 24 hours, you can repeat the icing four to five times throughout the day, or every two to three hours.
You can use either commercial ice packs or bags of frozen vegetables, like frozen peas. Peas are small enough to conform to the shape of your leg easily. You can also fill an old long tube sock with rice and keep it in the freezer for when you may need it.
Never place ice directly on the skin. Always wrap it in something (like a towel or t-shirt) to protect the skin.

, Wrap the injured area with a compression bandage or use compression shorts. The compression bandage or shorts helps to reduce swelling by limiting the swelling to that area. The compression also provides support to the injured area.The bandage should be wrapped tightly enough to apply medium pressure, but not so tightly as to cause any bulging around the bandage or stop blood flow.
Start wrapping high on your leg, above the injury.
Once the swelling has gone, you don’t need to wrap anymore.
If the pain increases with a compression bandage, it is too tight and you should loosen it.

, Elevate your leg by keeping it raised above the level of your heart for as much time as you can. This helps to reduce swelling.If you can’t raise the leg above the heart, keep it parallel to the ground.
After the first or second day, you should move a little bit every hour or so. Take it easy and take it slowly. Don’t overdo it. You can make it worse by re-injuring the thigh muscles.

Call your doctor before you do anything.,
Be aware that exercise may make pain worse.,
Consider seeing a chiropractor.,
Follow your practitioner’s instructions for exercise.",How to Get Rid of Pain Through Exercise1," If you are in pain, the first step is to contact your physician. If your physician does not treat your pain effectively or does not refer you to a physical or exercise therapist, consider getting a second opinion or seeing a pain specialist. A pain specialist is a physician who specializes in treating pain.


Once you have a diagnosis from a doctor, you can use this information to;
, Some injuries and conditions may be made worse by exercising, so it is best to determine the cause of your pain before you try to exercise it away. The biggest danger is in overexerting yourself. For example:


Over-stretching can result in torn muscles, microtears, and micro-bleeds.
Doing range of motion exercises improperly can cause micro-tears, microbleeds, and dislocations.
Intense aerobic and endurance exercises may cause a heart attack or stroke.

, For lower back pain and neck pain, a chiropractor may be the ideal healthcare professional to provide a referral and education concerning the best forms of exercise for you. For acute pain, the first step may be using a form of passive therapy to alleviate the pain. These therapies may include:Electrical muscle stimulation using a TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) unit. TENS consists of pads that you place on your skin. The pads transmit a very small electric charge through the skin and the muscle underlying the skin. It is believed that the electrical stimulation releases natural painkillers and blocks the transmission of pain.Heat and cold therapy. This therapy involves applying heat packs, cold packs or alternating hot and cold packs to the area producing the pain. For lower back and neck pain, the specific cause of the pain and type of pain can be important in determining which therapy or combination to use. A chiropractor or a physical or exercise therapist should be consulted to determine which is best for your form of pain.Massage therapy can help loosen up tight muscles. If your muscles are very tight, then that can often make pain worse.
Chiropractic manipulation. If you vertebrae are misaligned, back and muscle pain often results. A chiropractic manipulation can realign the vertebrae and reduce pain., Once the acute pain has decreased, consider an exercise program that includes stretching, strengthening exercises, and low-impact aerobic exercise. You may also consider doing water exercises.

Get on your knees and spread them as wide as you can, stabilizing yourself on your hands. Make sure your shins are parallel to one another. Arch your back so that your belly drops and your butt is pushed back. If you are more flexible, you can lower yourself to your forearms. You should feel the stretch in your inner thighs.For a good hamstring stretch, sit on the floor with one leg straight out and the other bent. Lean towards the straight leg, rotating at the hips. You should feel the stretch in the back of the thigh. Hold that for 30 seconds. Switch legs and repeat. You can also place both feet straight out in front of you and bend at the hip, reaching for your toes.To stretch the quads, stand and hold on to the wall or a chair to balance yourself. Bend your knee and grab the foot, bringing it as close to your butt as possible. You should feel the stretch in the front of the thigh.

, See your physician as soon as you can if, immediately after the injury, you cannot put any weight on the injured leg or you can’t walk more than four steps without significant pain.


See your physician if the pain or discomfort does not improve with the RICE method within five to seven days.
Physical therapy may be required for severe injuries. Ask your doctor for a referral to a massage therapist or physical therapist.

Learn the cause of a pulled thigh muscle.,
Recognize the symptoms of a pulled thigh muscle.,
Know the risk factors for thigh strain.,
Visit your doctor.",How to Get Rid of Thigh Pain3," Pulled thigh muscles can be very painful and most commonly occur while running, kicking, skating, and weightlifting; however, they can also be strained just by walking. A pulled thigh muscle can happen anytime there is a sudden stretching of these muscles and can occur anywhere along the length of the muscles.It is very important to warm up and stretch the muscles in the thigh before any activity. If these muscles have not been adequately stretched, you are at a higher risk of straining and injuring the muscle.

, The most common symptom of a strained thigh muscle is a sudden and sharp pain at the muscle. This can be at the front or back of the thigh, at the inner thigh, or at the hip, knees, or groin, depending on which muscle has been strained.Many people also report hearing or feeling a pop.
Within a short time, from minutes to hours, swelling, bruising, and tenderness at the area of the injury is common.
There may also be some degree of weakness, or you may not be able to walk or put any weight on your leg.

, Thigh pain occurs often with thigh strain. Some people are at higher risk than others. The greatest risk factors for thigh muscle strain is:Participation in any sport that involves running, kicking, and sprinting, especially if enough time is not taken to stretch the muscles before participating. Dancing and other vigorous activities can put you at higher risk as well.
A history of muscle strain. Previous thigh muscle injuries do weaken the muscle and make it more likely to happen again
Starting physical activity while in poor shape or before the muscles are properly stretched.
Muscle imbalance. Since the quadriceps and the hamstrings work together, along with the adductor muscles, if one group of muscles is much stronger than another, it can strain the weaker muscle group.

, Most thigh pain will go away with the above methods; however, sometimes thigh pain may not be due to a sprain, strain, sore muscle, or cramp, but a symptom of a much more severe condition. If you have chronic pain that doesn't get better, cannot put weight on your leg after a few days, see abnormal swelling or bruising, or find no at-home treatments are working, you should see your doctor.If you experienced an injury that caused thigh pain, you may want to see your doctor if you believe it is severe.
If you are unsure of the cause of your thigh pain, you can see your doctor as soon as it happens just to be sure.

Hire an attorney.",How to Check Recalls on Medications," In response to consumer demand for a streamlined process, a diverse array of American government agencies have joined forces to establish a “one-stop shopping” website for product recalls, including for medications. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which oversees medication safety in the U.S., is a member of this cooperative.


On the home screen, you will find a list of tabs along the top. Clicking the “Medicine” tab will lead you to the FDA page on the site, from which you can go on to http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ (which you can also access directly). Once there, you can check a list of current medication recalls.
You also have the option to sign up (with your email address) to the FDA Recall Subscription List or for FDA Free Email Updates. These options mean you will be alerted automatically to new medication recalls.;
, Every national government has its own policies and procedures regarding medication recalls, of course; however, the odds are increasingly good that your home government maintains an accessible online listing of current recalls. Other English-speaking nations with recall websites include, for instance:


Canada: http://healthycanadians.gc.ca/recall-alert-rappel-avis/index-eng.php

Australia: https://www.tga.gov.au/recall-actions

United Kingdom: https://www.gov.uk/drug-device-alerts


, However you consume your news — TV, online, newspapers, etc. — product recalls are often prominent items of interest. Local television newscasts in the U.S., for instance, seem to always have at least one mention of some sort of toy, food, medication, or other recall. If you are not on the FDA notification list, this may be the most likely way that you will find out about a recall.


News reports are only a first step, though. Always confirm the details of a recall at the FDA (or other equivalent) website. Never “jump the gun” and alter your medication regimen based on a brief news report.

, If you see the name of one of your medications on the recall list, investigate further to determine if your specific medication is indeed under recall. Recall press releases should contain information regarding the lot number, product code, expiration date, or other identifying information that will let you know if your specific bottle of aspirin (for example) is being recalled.If Lot #12345 of Acme Aspirin is under recall, and your bottle is from Lot #56789, your medication should be safe to continue using. You can, if you desire, confirm this information with your pharmacist, physician, or the drug manufacturer.

, While medication recalls are generally straightforward and easy to grasp, it can never hurt to better understand how a recall notice takes shape. In the U.S., recalls are usually initiated by the drug manufacturers, but the FDA can request (or in more limited instances, order) a recall by the manufacturer as well.Medications can be recalled for a host of reasons, but the most common causes include the product being: a potential health hazard; mislabeled or poorly packaged; possibly contaminated; misidentified (that is, the wrong thing is in the package); or poorly manufactured.
Some recalls are due to serious health concerns. For instance, medications containing the drug PPA were recalled in 2000 because of an increased risk of bleeding in the brain, and the weight-loss drug Meridia was recalled in 2010 because of an increased risk of heart attack or stroke.That said, most recalls are made out of an abundance of caution, and involve concerns like a minor mislabeling error that is not overly likely to cause harm. When you hear there is a recall on a medication you take, don't panic. Instead, find out the details of the recall and follow the instructions given, and contact your doctor or pharmacist as warranted., If your aspirin, cough medicine, antacids, etc. have not been prescribed by a doctor and are under recall, do not delay in stopping their use. Stop the medication, then contact your pharmacist or physician for more information and possible alternate medication options.To be clear, if you take aspirin for an occasional headache, it functions as an OTC medication that should be stopped immediately if under recall. If you take a daily low-dose aspirin as advised by your doctor, it functions as a prescribed medication and should not be immediately stopped without contacting your doctor first.

, Recall or not, you should never stop taking a prescribed medication without first contacting your physician. Stopping a prescribed medication, especially “cold turkey,” can have serious health consequences, both in the absence of that medication and in altered interactions with other medications you may be taking.Do not delay in contacting your doctor once you find out your prescription medication is recalled, but also do not stop taking your regular dosing of the medication until you receive new instructions. Your physician will likely provide a course of action for stopping the use of the recalled drug (possibly over a period of time) and replacing it with an alternative.

, Usually, you can return a recalled medication to the place of purchase and receive a refund for your purchase price. The recall notice will normally provide information to this effect. If this is not possible for you, or you are not interested in a refund, you can take the medication to a nearby pharmacy for proper disposal.Do not simply throw away recalled medications, or flush them down the toilet. Some medications can be rendered inert by mixing them with coffee grounds, and then be thrown away, but the best option is to take the medication to a pharmacy for disposal.

, Any time there is a major medication recall, it is a good bet that someone, somewhere is going to be sued. Even if you are not the litigious type, you should strongly consider your legal options if you are confident that a recalled medication has caused you an injury — for instance, one of the negative, unexpected side effects that triggered the recall.While there are unique aspects when medications are involved, your legal options usually involve filing suit for a “defective product liability claim.” In order to win such claims, you must prove these three things in a court of law:

You were injured.
The product (medication) was defective or improperly marketed.
This defect or improper marketing caused your injury.



, Once you have determined that a recalled medication caused you harm and you want to file a lawsuit, you need to clarify the type(s) of liability claim(s) you intend to make. You can contend that: the drug was defectively manufactured (for instance, tainted during manufacturing); the drug had dangerous side effects (that were not adequately communicated to you); and/or that the drug was improperly marketed (that is, the instructions, warnings, or list of side effects were defective or incomplete).You also need to start considering which party or parties should be the target of your lawsuit, based upon the nature of the defect and your injury. Common parties to defective medication lawsuits include: the manufacturer; the laboratory that tested the product; the pharmaceutical sales representative that promoted the product to your doctor; the prescribing physician; and the hospital, clinic, or pharmacy that was part of the “chain of distribution.”

, Suing a giant drug manufacturer, with its army of attorneys, is not typically a wise move to make alone. Many attorneys specialize particularly on medication liability claims, and can provide you with critical advice moving forward.Almost invariably, if a recalled medication has caused numerous injuries, a class action lawsuit will be filed. Essentially, large numbers of injured parties band together into one lawsuit against the parties they deem responsible. You can choose to join the class action suit, or you can continue to pursue legal action on your own. This is one of many instances where an experienced attorney will prove invaluable.

Treatment often includes therapy and/or medication. Taking medication is a big decision to make. Carefully consider your options and discuss your concerns with your prescriber.


Some questions to ask may include, “How will the medication help me? What side-effects should I look out for? Should I avoid any foods? Are drug interactions with other prescriptions or supplements a possibility? How will this medication interact with any other medications I take?”;
, Some medications are more suitable for one kind of anxiety than another. Make sure you have a clear diagnosis prior to obtaining medication, as some medications are more effective at treating certain diagnoses better than others. Let your provider know what you want to treat and how often you want to take medication. For instance, benzodiazepines are best used for short-term use, whereas SSRIs and other medications are more suitable for long-term use.


It’s important to communicate to your provider any medications you currently take. Drug interactions can occur with anxiety medications, so speak up about any prescription or nonprescription drugs you take. Also note any supplements or herbs you take regularly., Many medications come with risks and side-effects. Talk to your provider about possible side-effects you may encounter. Share any medical or psychological diagnoses you have and that you take medication to treat. Bring up any possibility that you are pregnant, want to get pregnant, or are breastfeeding.Some people experience serious side-effects or allergic reactions. Others may feel no effect of the medication at all and may need to change medications.
Some medications come with the risk of abuse. Some medications may come with the risk of withdrawal symptoms when terminating use. Discuss these risks ahead of time with your provider.

, Medications do not cure psychological conditions, they aim to ease symptoms. Therapy is an effective way of identifying negative thought and behavior patterns in your life and learning more adaptive and positive coping skills.If you wish to avoid negative side-effects or interactions, consider choosing therapy before obtaining medication. For many individuals, therapy alone is the best course of treatment.Choosing medication and therapy can be beneficial in treating severe anxiety. Medication can help ease symptoms while therapy can help you learn skills to approach life differently.

, If you do obtain medications, use as directed. Do not combine doses or take more or less than your prescriber intended. Do not double dose or skip doses. If you do, notify your prescriber.


Do not share medication with others. Do not use prescription medications as recreational drugs.Make regular appointments with your prescriber to monitor benefits, side-effects, and proper dosage.

, Benzodiazepines (benzos) are by far the most commonly prescribed anti-anxiety medications. Benzos are used to slow down the central nervous system and can be beneficial for anxiety disorders such as panic attacks or other overwhelming anxiety episodes. Benzos work quickly (within 30-60 minutes), making them useful for dealing with specific stressors.Benzos can be most helpful in short-term situations such as relieving a panic attack, dealing with a specific stressor, or helping to calm the mind and body for a specific event.
Some common benzos include lorazepam (Ativan), alprazolam (Xanax), midazolam (Versed), oxazepam (Serax), and clonazepam (Klonopin)., Contact your prescriber with any serious side-effects. Common side effects include drowsiness and dizziness, nausea, stomach upset, blurred vision, headache, confusion, depression, trembling, weakness, grogginess, or memory loss.If side-effects are too severe, your prescriber may change medications or alter the dose.


Notify a medical professional if you develop chest pains, changes in heart rate, vision changes, or yellowing in the eyes or of the skin.
Few people develop an allergic reaction to benzodiazepines. If you do develop a reaction, watch out for rash, itching, swelling, dizziness, or difficulty breathing.
Any major impacts such as hallucinations, confusion, or major health upsets should be reported to your prescriber right away.

, Benzos are a schedule IV controlled substance, meaning there is a high risk for addiction, abuse, and use for diversion.Benzos can become highly addictive, which is why they are recommended only for short-term use.


If you are at-risk for abusing benzos or for using them recreationally, do not take them.

, Tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal can occur with long-term use of benzodiazepines. For this reason, benzos are best used for short-term problems or intermittently. Long-term treatment of anxiety should not include the use of benzos. It’s best to use benzos for a matter of weeks (up to 4 weeks) and no more.If you wish to treat long-term anxiety, stay away from benzos. Ask about other options that are safe for long-term use.
Unpleasant withdrawal symptoms can occur with prolonged use of benzos. Do not stop benzos “cold turkey.” Follow the protocol given to you by your prescriber to safely stop using benzos.

, Those with liver problems, kidney disease, or drug allergies should communicate the diagnosis and any medication used to treat these conditions to the prescriber prior to obtaining medication. Benzos can negatively interact with other prescription and nonprescription drugs, so be sure to bring up any medications you currently take with your prescriber.During your appointment with your prescriber, discuss any medications you are currently taking. This includes vitamins, herbs, supplements, and recreational drugs. Note any allergies or adverse effects you’ve encountered with other medications, or that family members have encountered.Benzos are not recommended for elderly patients as side effects can be more severe.Discuss any plans to get pregnant with your provider, as benzos can be associated with birth defects when taken during pregnancy., If you take benzos, avoid eating or drinking grapefruit and taking Kava or St. John’s Wort.Some interactions can lead to severe sedation and be deadly, such as interaction with alcohol, barbiturates, narcotics, and tranquilizers.If you regularly drink alcohol, benzos may not be the right medication for you as it can be unsafe to consume alcohol and take benzos.Talk to your prescriber.

, Although considered antidepressants, some medications can be used to treat anxiety effectively. Unlike anti-anxiety medication, antidepressants are safe for long term use.Antidepressant medication may be most beneficial for individuals who suffer from long-term anxiety symptoms.


Some medications used to treat anxiety include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and atypical antidepressants.SSRIs are most typically prescribed for treating anxiety. SSRI medications include Citalopram (Celexa), Escitalopram (Lexapro), Fluoxetine (Prozac), Paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva), Sertraline, (Zoloft), and Paxil CR., The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States of America requires that all antidepressant medication receive a “black box label,” the most severe warning for prescription drugs. Children, teenagers, and young adults (up to age 25) are warned to be at increased risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors while taking antidepressant medication.Suicide risk is highest in the first weeks and months of taking medications as well as when changes are made in your dose.
If you experience suicidal thoughts or behaviors seek help immediately. Contact your therapist and psychiatrist. Go to the Emergency Department, call a hotline, or call a friend to help you.

, Do not take antidepressants if there is a risk you may be allergic to the medication. Inquire about family history with antidepressants. Be careful in mixing or overlapping antidepressant medication with other prescription drugs. Avoid SSRIs if you have taken the following medications within the past two weeks: thioridazine (Mellaril), pimozide (Orap), or monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) such as phenelzine (Nardil) and tranylcypromine (Parnate).Take extra precaution if you have one of the following diagnoses: a heart condition, prostate enlargement, glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, epilepsy, liver problems, or bipolar disorder.Do not take antidepressants and St John’s Wort at the same time. This can fill your body with too much serotonin and lead to Serotonin Syndrome.If you take St John’s Wort, let your prescriber know prior to obtaining a prescription.

, Some common side-effects of antidepressants include insomnia/sleepiness, nausea, dry mouth, dizziness, sexual dysfunction, and weight gain.Side-effects are likely to increase when first starting medication or when changes to your dose are made.Contact your provider if you experience negative side-effects. He or she may adjust your dose or provide a different medication.

, If you do take antidepressant medication, do not stop taking medication without notifying your prescriber. You may experience withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, dizziness, anxiety, stomach upset, or flu-like symptoms.You will likely slowly taper your doses over several weeks or months. Use as directed.

, BuSpar is a newer anti-anxiety medication that is slower acting than other anti-anxiety medications. Unlike other anti-anxiety medications, BuSpar is less sedating, does not impair memory and coordination, it’s not very addictive, and the withdrawal effects are minimal.BuSpar is recommended for older adults and those with a history of substance abuse, as it is not addictive.

, BuSpar can cause nausea, headaches, dizziness, drowsiness, diarrhea, dry mouth, and upset stomach. The side-effects of BuSpar appear to be less pronounced than other medication side effects. Withdrawal appears to be less pronounced as well.Talk to your prescriber regarding any negative side-effects you experience. He or she may adjust the dosage or change medications.

, Alert your provider to any medications you currently take, including prescription medications, herbs, supplements, or recreational drugs. BuSpar can negatively interact with monoamine oxidase inhibitors(MAOIs) such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), tranylcypromine (Parnate), and procarbazine (Matulane) and trazodone (Desyrel).Talk with your provider if you take any of these medications

, BuSpar appears to only effectively treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). It does not seem to effectively treat severe anxiety or other anxiety disorders such as phobias, panic attacks, or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).Talk to your prescriber whether BuSpar is a good option for you.

, Although typically prescribed for high blood pressure, beta blockers can be used to treat symptoms of anxiety. They are most useful for treating phobias like social phobia and performance anxiety.Beta blockers do not address emotional symptoms of anxiety, and therefore do not effectively treat worry.


Beta blockers used to treat anxiety include the drugs propranolol (Inderal) and atenolol (Tenormin).

, Tell your provider if you have a history of asthma or lung disease, heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes, or allergies to any medications. This may influence whether beta blockers are right for you or if they may negatively impact your condition or interact with medications., Beta blockers can include side-effects such as nausea, drowsiness, slow pulse, cold hands, and light-headedness. Less common side-effects include shortness of breath, trouble sleeping, loss of sex drive, and depression.Alert your provider if you experience negative side-effects. He or she may change your dose or put you on a new medication.

Check the appearance of the pharmacy.,
Note the professionalism (or lack of it) of the staff.,
Observe the pharmacist’s behavior and content of speech.,
Listen to the actual content of his speech:


Does he explain to you how to follow the dosage (take the right medication, how many times a day, for how many days, with or without food, the side effects etc…) ?,
Find out if the pharmacy deals with your insurance provider, and how they bill, including the difference in prices for name brand verses generic medications.

,
Ask if the pharmacy has a database to track your medications to make sure no unexpected drug interactions will occur that can put your health at risk.

,
Check to make sure detailed purchase histories are maintained at the pharmacy if you are going to form a long-term relationship with them.,
Make sure the pharmacy accepts phone-in prescriptions from your doctor's office.",How to Choose a Pharmacist," Does the pharmacy look clean and neat? This is from your own judgement, if you see that the over-the-counter medications on the shelves look messy, the price tags are wrongly placed, you’ll have a hard time finding what you need, you may have reservations about the establishment. Take a glimpse inside the laboratory where medications are compounded (if your pharmacist does this) and see if it is neat, well-organised, and clean. If you step in a restaurant that has dirty dishes and utensils, unclean tables and disorganized chairs, you can imagine how the kitchen looks like, and the food that comes out from it. Please take precautions.;
, A pharmacy, depending on the size, may have many departments, and there are good and bad people everywhere. Don’t judge the whole company by just one incompetent employee. It can be someone that had a bad day and gave you a poor customer service when you asked him which aisle the toothpaste was. Please read the following description with your own judgement:-


Inappropriate outfit, hairstyles, makeup or other bodily expressions:If these are obviously displayed, it might be a consideration.
Inappropriate behavior:E.g.: chewing gum when talking, inattentive, not looking you in the eyes, runs around the laboratory, gossips out loud. Keep in mind, an unprofessional technician is prone to make mistakes, which means entering the wrong medications with the wrong dosage, preparing the wrong medication at the wrong quantity and maybe for the wrong patient, or even a chain of mistakes. The pharmacists trusts and relies on his assistant, he’s not a genius that can detect all mistakes, he is a human too. You are handing your prescription to someone you judge professional, in which you trust. But the expression that says : “Don’t stereotype until you get to know the person.” Must be used wisely when you’re dealing with your own health and life. You can choose to trust your instincts in exceptional situations. Just like a restaurant and it’s staff that give off a certain vibe that attracts a certain type of clientele, choosing a pharmacy is not a joke.

, The most important is what the pharmacist tells you. Poor customer service is a different issue, the point here is really the way he talks to you and the content of his speech.


Does he seem in a hurry and talks to you too fast?
Is he attentive when he talks to you?
Is he multitasking when talking to you? Is he receptive? Does he understand and answer your questions?
Does he become annoyed when you’re asking questions or when you ask him to repeat what he just said because you didn’t understand?
Is he pushy and only wants you to pay and get rid of you as soon as possible?

,
Does what he say make sense to you? Do you understand what he says? If not, is it because he doesn’t explain to you properly or it simply doesn’t make sense?
Does he contradict himself? Can he answer all your questions? If not, does he actively look for an answer or refer you to another resource or does he just ignore and leave your questions unanswered? #*Does he seem sure about what he's telling you when he talks to you?If the behavior and the content of his speech were suspicious, you always have the right to contact your doctor, or get your prescription back to get it filled in another pharmacy.

,,, This will make it easier for you to track expenses for tax purposes as well as making it easier to get refills for medications that are taken long term.

, This will make refilling or getting emergency medications much easier and quicker in some circumstances.

Follow your doctor’s instructions exactly.,
Determine if your antibiotics should be taken with food.,
Make sure to take the correct amount of the antibiotic each day.,
Increase the amount of good bacteria in your body.,
Tell your doctor about past experiences you've had with antibiotics.",How to Avoid Stomach Pain when Taking Antibiotics1," When your doctor writes you a prescription for antibiotics, she will give you specific instructions regarding how to take the medication. Following these instructions exactly can help to reduce your chances of developing stomach pain, as your doctor will most likely give you tips on how to avoid this unpleasant side effect.


Your instructions may include a specific time that you should take the antibiotics so that they will have the least effect on your stomach.
Unless the label indicates otherwise, store your antibiotics in a dark, dry place.
Some antibiotics may need to be stored in the refrigerator. If so, store your medicine in the fresh food compartment. Never freeze your antibiotics.;
, Some antibiotics are meant to be taken with food. This is because the food acts as a neutralizer or shield against the antibiotics, protecting your stomach from gastrointestinal distress. If your instructions include taking your antibiotics with food, make sure to do so every time you have to take your medication or else you may end up with an upset stomach.Some antibiotics are meant to be taken on an empty stomach. These sorts of antibiotics include ampicillin and tetracycline. You should not take food with these drugs because the food affects the speed at which these medications can act upon your body.
If need to take your antibiotics on an empty stomach, it's best to take them before breakfast, Set an alarm for yourself if you need help remembering.
Some antibiotics may cause stomach pain when taken certain foods. For example tetracycline may result in stomach pain when taken with dairy products. To avoid stomach pain when taking tetracycline (or its counterparts, doxycycline and minocycline), stay away from dairy products for the length of time you're taking the antibiotic.

, Be precise in your taking of your antibiotics; do not underdose, overdose, or double dose. While underdosing will have less of an effect on the bacterial infection you are trying to fight, overdosing can increase the potency of the drug, making it much more likely that you will have an upset stomach.If you have a hard time remembering if you have already taken your medication for the day, hang a calendar where you keep your medications. When you take your antibiotics for the day, cross the day off on the calendar with a pen. That way, you will not double dose accidentally.
Your prescription will be written for the amount of time it will take the antibiotic to fight off the bacterial infection. If you don't take your antibiotic as prescribed, it's likely the bacteria that's left can restart an infection, or the antibiotics may not work as well the next time they're needed.

, Aside from fighting off the bad bacteria in your body, antibiotics may also attack the good bacteria in your body. When this good bacteria is attacked, you may experience stomach pain. Try restoring your healthy levels of good bacteria to address stomach pain.Yogurt is an excellent source of probiotics, or good bacteria. While you normally only have to eat one serving of yogurt a day to reap its benefits, consider eating three to five servings of yogurt a day when you are taking antibiotics in order to replenish your stores of good bacteria. Look for yogurt that contains live, active culture for best results.
Garlic is a good source of prebiotics. Prebiotics provide nourishment for probiotics (found in, for example, yogurt, raw sauerkraut). A serving of three large cloves per day may help protect your healthy levels of healthy bacteria (just be aware that this may cause bad breath).
Other sources of good bacteria include miso, sauerkraut, kombucha, and kefir., If you have a known history of stomach pain caused by antibiotics, you should discuss this fact with your doctor. Your doctor may give you an alternative drug.Your doctor may also adjust the dose so that it is less likely that the medication will cause you stomach pain, or he can prescribe antiemetic medication to lessen gastrointestinal upset like nausea or vomiting.
Certain antibiotics may cause an allergic reaction. If you start to notice rash or itching when taking a new antibiotic, call your doctor immediately.

Drink a cup of chamomile tea.,
Apply a ""hot"" pack to your belly.,
Drink some rice water.,
Enjoy a hot cup of fresh ginger tea.",How to Avoid Stomach Pain when Taking Antibiotics2," Chamomile is a mild herbal remedy that can works as an anti-inflammatory. If your stomach lining is upset by the imbalance of bacteria as a result of your medication, chamomile tea can help soothe your stomach.Bring water to a boil, then pour over a chamomile tea bag.
Cover your tea cup or your pot, and allow your tea to steep for 15–20 minutes. The longer your tea steeps, the stronger it will be.
Add a teaspoon of honey or other sweetener if you like, but the tea itself is quite sweet without additional sweetener.

, Placing a hot water bottle or electric heating pad may help your stomach relax, and feel better. If your pain is due to cramps caused by antibiotics, the feeling of warmth against your skin may help you relax and feel better.If you don't have a hot pack, try filling a clean cloth container (a sock will work) with dried pinto beans or rice. Make sure the container is closed (you can tie it closed, or use a clothespin) and put it in the microwave for 30 seconds (or until the ingredients are warm to the touch).
Don't let let the hot pack get too hot. You want it to feel warm against your skin.
Find a comfortable place to lie down, where you can balance the hot pack against your stomach. Leave it in place for at least 15 minutes. You may repeat as often as you'd like to.

, Rice water is water that is left over after cooking rice. Drinking rice water helps soothe the stomach by making a sort of soothing barrier over the lining of your stomach.Make your own rice water by cooking 1/2 cup of rice (plain white rice is fine) with twice the amount of water required - in this case, 1/2 cup of rice should be cooked with 2 cups of water. Bring the rice-water mix to a boil, then turn it down and allow it to simmer for 20 minutes, or until the rice is tender.
Pour rice and water through a sieve, reserving the rice for a bland meal. Catch the rice water in a bowl or kitchen pot.
Fill a drinking glass with the rice water, and enjoy the rice water warm. You can add a spoonful of honey if you'd like.

, Ginger relaxes the muscles that line your intestinal track, and is a well-known remedy for stomach cramps. Ginger root is also great for relieving nausea. Sipping on a warm infusion of ginger tea may help relieve the stomach pain caused by antibiotics.Wash, peel, and roughly chop 1–2 inches of ginger root. Bring 1–2 cups of water to a boil, then add your ginger. The more water you use, the more diluted your tea will be; however, if you steep the ginger in the water, your tea will be stronger.
Boil for three to five minutes, then allow to steep for three to five minutes more.
Remove the ginger tea from the heat, strain out the chunks of ginger, and pour your fresh ginger tea into a mug or teapot.
You may add a spoonful of honey or other sweetener if you wish. Some people enjoy a slice of lemon with their hot ginger tea, which may also help with stomach pain.

Administer a dose when seated.,
Keep the person calm.,
Rinse out the mouth.,
Place the tablet under the tongue.,
Move the tablet if needed.,
Allow the tablet to dissolve.,
Give the patient another tablet as needed.,
Avoid exceeding dosing limits.",How to Administer Sublingual Nitroglycerin,"


The person taking sublingual nitroglycerin should be in an upright, comfortable seated position. This is important for ensuring proper administration of the dose, preventing accidental swallowing of the medication and helping blood pump through the heart.;
,


Administer sublingual nitroglycerin while trying to keep the person experiencing the chest pains as calm as possible. It's important to maintain as regular a heart rate as possible to allow the medication to circulate and to help alleviate the chest pain.

,


Rinse the mouth out with clean water and spit the water out before administering a dose of sublingual nitroglycerin. This will aid the mucous membranes in the mouth in absorbing the medication faster.

,


Position the sublingual tablet of nitroglycerin under the tongue so that it is completely covered by the tongue.

,


Nitroglycerin can cause a warming or tingling sensation when placed under the tongue. Reposition the tablet under the tongue if this occurs. Be sure the tablet is still completely covered by the tongue.

,


Wait for at least 5 minutes with the tablet under the tongue to allow the tablet to fully dissolve. The person taking the medication should avoid eating, drinking, talking, moving or standing during this time.

,


Administer another tablet of sublingual nitroglycerin if symptoms or chest pains have not improved within 5 minutes of the first tablet being fully dissolved. Call a doctor if symptoms have not improved after the first dose has been taken.

,


Do not administer more than 3 tablets of sublingual nitroglycerin. This is the maximum dosage of sublingual nitroglycerin that can be taken at one time. Allow at least 12 hours before administering another dose.

Stay hydrated.,
Eat high-fiber foods.,
Increase your magnesium intake.,
Go slow when integrating foods that may cause gas.,
Add 20-30 minutes of exercise to your day.",How to Avoid Constipation when Taking Temodar (Temozolomide)1," Drinking water (and other non-caffeinated liquids) is very important to avoid constipation.Unless your doctor told you to restrict your fluids, regularly drink 8-12 cups daily of fluids like water, decaf tea, warm lemonade, or prune juice.Water can also help flush out excess toxins from chemotherapy.


Aim to drink 2-3 quarts of fluid every 24 hours.Caffeine, like in coffee and tea, can act like a diuretic and increase how much you urinate. This can contribute to dehydration, and should generally be avoided while constipated.;
, Always check with your doctor or cancer team before making dramatic changes to your diet. However, it is recommended to improve your diet rather than to take lots of vitamins and supplements. If appropriate, increase how much fiber you eat. You should get 25-30 grams of fiber from food daily. Many people do not hit that requirement.It's unlikely you'll exceed 30 grams of fiber, but try not to - keep track of your fiber and aim for that range. Whole grain cereal, oats, beans, lentils, nuts, seeds, and whole fruits and vegetables are good sources of fiber.


Drink 8 ounces or more of fluid when you eat lots of fiber or take a supplement, and stay hydrated. You can make constipation worse if you increase your fiber but don't drink enough water.Fiber is very filling, so be sure to get the daily calories you need if weight loss is a concern.
Add fiber to your diet gradually so your body can get used to it. Otherwise you might experience bloating or gas.For breakfast, try high fiber cereal and bars (bran, oats and flax), fresh and dried fruit, and whole grain bagels and oats.
For lunch and dinner, eat some whole grain and high fiber breads or pasta, brown rice, quinoa, beans and nuts, vegetables, leafy greens, and fruit.
If reaching fiber requirements is difficult, a fiber supplement can be added. Discuss this with your doctor.

, Discuss with your care team whether adding a high quality magnesium supplement is a good choice for you. Magnesium such as magnesium citrate can help with constipation.Start with a low dose and use the lowest dose effective to avoid diarrhea.


Foods rich in magnesium include: nuts (almonds, cashews, peanuts), spinach, black beans, avocado, kidney beans, broccoli, carrot, banana, apple, raisins, whole wheat bread and cereals, milk and soymilk, yogurt, edamame, brown rice, salmon, halibut, chicken breast, and ground beef.Get the magnesium you can from foods.

, You’ll probably feel better and improve constipation if you incorporate new foods slowly and limit foods likely to cause gas in the early stages of changing your diet. However, once your body adjusts to the increased fiber and new foods, you will not have to worry about being gassy. Beans, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, onions, and lettuce are the vegetables most likely to make you gassy, so integrate these slowly and limit your servings at first. Avoid carbonated and fizzy beverages.


Don’t chew gum. Drink straight from your glass instead of using a straw. Don’t talk much while you’re eating. These small changes will help decrease how much air you swallow., A sedentary job and life style can aggravate constipation.You may not be feeling your best, but add some light exercise to your daily routine to help minimize constipation. Walk, take a light jog, use an elliptical, dance – do whatever activity you enjoy to get you and your bowels moving.

Ask about dopamine antagonists.,
Try serotonin antagonists for long-term results.",How to Alleviate Nausea from Medicine," Unless a drug is specifically meant to be taken on an empty stomach (double-check with your doctor), you should take medications with food, preferably immediately after a meal.Food can absorb and dilute the compounds that trigger nausea, particularly if you're taking antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) and even multivitamins.


Don't get too full and bloated with large meals — it may make nausea worse. Instead, eat smaller meals throughout the day.
Don't skip meals. Eat regularly, even if it's just a snack, such as a piece of bread or fruit or a few saltine crackers.
Eating a light meal a few hours before a chemotherapy treatment also may help combat nausea.;
, Along with eating smaller portions more frequently through the day, it's also best to avoid foods that are fatty, fried or exceptionally sweet when you take medication because all can increase the risk of nausea/vomiting.Stick to bland foods, prepared naturally and higher in protein, such as a turkey sandwich without mayonnaise.


It's also a good idea to avoid cooking foods that leave an unpleasant odor in your house, such as fatty foods, garlic and onions.
Consider making and consuming fresh fruit smoothies before taking medications. Add in some veggies for fiber, protein powder and plain yogurt to buffer any acidity.
Chemotherapy patients should cook and freeze bland meals prior to treatment to avoid cooking when they don't feel well.

, Drinking lots of fluids between meals can also help alleviate nausea from taking medicine.Try drinking cool beverages, such as filtered water, unsweetened fruit juices, herbal tea or ginger ale that's lost its carbonation. Drink them slowly and don't gulp them, as too much air in your stomach causes bloating.


Avoid drinking coffee and colas — they are too acidic and may upset your stomach.
It's better to drink small amounts throughout the day, rather than large amounts less frequently.
Don't drink too much liquid with your meals because your digestive enzymes get diluted and your stomach can get too full.

, Resting after you've eaten a small meal and taken medicine can help settle your stomach, keep you calm and alleviate nausea.The key is not to do any vigorous activity for at least 30 minutes or so after eating, but don't lie down while you’re resting either — it promotes indigestion and heartburn, which can contribute to nausea.


Instead of lying on the sofa, sit up in a comfortable chair and read or watch TV.
Go for a relaxing slow-paced walk around your neighborhood and get some fresh air if the weather allows it.

, Taking more medication than recommended is a common cause of nausea and vomiting, so read labels carefully and follow your doctor's instructions precisely.Some people think if a little medicine is good, then more must be better, but that's never the case with medications.


Medications in larger than recommended doses are toxic and commonly trigger nausea and vomiting because your body is trying to prevent over-toxicity.
Tell your doctor if you've suddenly lost a lot of weight because your medication dosages will likely have to be lowered to prevent side effects such as nausea.
Really going overboard with too much medication can lead to overdose symptoms, which may include loss of consciousness and potential death — the nausea and vomiting stage is often skipped.

, The time of day a drug is taken is sometimes an important consideration when trying preventing nausea caused by dizziness.For example, taking antidepressant medications called SSRIs at bedtime prevents the vomiting center of your brain from being activated by any dizziness because you're asleep.


This strategy can be used for essentially all medications, although eating before bedtime can be risky for indigestion and heartburn. As such, have a little snack about an hour before bedtime, then take your medication right before retiring.
If you're taking medications for pain relief, you'll likely want the symptomatic relief while you're awake during the day.

, There are some herbal (plant-based) remedies that are helpful for combating nausea, but you have to be very careful they don't interact negatively with your medicine. Ginger is one of the most recognized herbal treatments for nausea because it can soothe an upset stomach (it has anti-inflammatory properties), but it doesn't interact with most drugs.Ginger is particularly helpful for chemotherapy patients.


You can eat pickled ginger (the stuff that often comes with sushi), or take capsules/pills. Beverages made with real ginger may also be helpful.
Peppermint is another traditional remedy used for nausea, indigestion and upset stomachs. Both peppermint leaves (made into a tea) and peppermint oil (taken under the tongue) can be used to combat nausea from medication use.
Red raspberry leaf herbal tea is a traditional remedy used to combat morning sickness, but it might also be helpful for other types of nausea. Make sure to steep the leaves in hot water for at least 15 minutes for best results.

, Discuss the severity and frequency of your nausea with your doctor if it's caused by taking medication. In addition to altering the timing and dosages of your medications, he may be able to switch formulations or change to an alternate type of drug with similar properties.Don't make any changes yourself without consulting your doctor.


Switching from tablets to liquid formulations might significantly alleviate nausea, especially in people who gag when they take tablets, pills or capsules.
In some cases, changing to a different manufacturer or to a generic brand can make a difference due to the use of different dyes, binders and sweeteners used in pills.
The taste of medication can make a big difference. Some people prefer sweet flavors, others prefer bitter or tasteless medication.

, If changing dosages, formulations and brands doesn't alleviate your nausea while taking your prescribed medicine, then your doctor may give you an anti-nausea agent. For example, dopamine agonists are especially effective for preventing nausea caused by strong painkillers (opioids), but they can also be beneficial for nausea caused by most other medications.Dopamine agonists minimize the effect of dopamine at the brain's vomiting/nausea center, which is in the medulla.Dopamine agonists are a good choice for reducing nausea if you're taking medications short-term, such as antibiotics or NSAIDs.
Using dopamine agonists for too long (or taking too much) can actually trigger nausea, loss of appetite and vomiting.

, The use of serotonin receptor antagonists (ondansetron, granisetron) may be beneficial for long-term prevention of nausea caused by medication use.In general, serotonin antagonists are safer and have fewer side effects compared to dopamine agonists, but they're also more expensive, so their use is often limited by cost to the patient.


Selective serotonin antagonists inhibit the action of serotonin in the small intestine, vagus nerve and chemoreceptor trigger zone in the stomach. Consequently, the medullary vomiting center is not stimulated.Due to their diffuse blockage of serotonin, these drugs are the primary choice for a variety of causes of nausea.
Ondansetron (Zofran, Zuplenz) is one of the most commonly prescribed anti-nausea drugs.

Seek a prescription for a laxative.,
Follow your “bowel program” accurately.,
Consult your doctor if you haven’t had a bowel movement in over 3 days.",How to Avoid Constipation when Taking Temodar (Temozolomide)2," Sometimes, using a stool softener along with proper diet can prevent constipation. There are a number of stool softeners that you can get without a prescription, from your local drug store. Try Colace (docusate sodium), senna (Senokot), bisacodyl (Dulcolax, Correctol, and more), milk of magnesia (magnesium hydroxide), MiraLAX, or Metamucil.Consult with your cancer care team before starting an OTC medication, to make sure it won’t interfere with your other medications or health needs.

, Sometimes when on Temodar or other medications, you will simply need to be on a prescribed laxative, as well. There are many different kinds of laxatives that work in different ways. “Bulk-forming” laxatives like psyllium, polycarbophil, or methylcellulose are often prescribed first for mild constipation; docusate may be prescribed with these to help prevent straining.If the above laxatives don’t help, your doctor may prescribe something like glycerin, polyethylene glycol, lactulose, or sorbitol. Metoclopramide is another type of laxative that can be used when chemotherapy agents cause constipation.Laxatives come in many forms, like pills, suppositories, and enemas. Your care team can help you decide what is the best medicine to take, on what schedule to take it, and what form it should be in for your particular needs.

, Your cancer care team, if needed, will prescribe you a bowel program to prevent or treat your constipation while you take Temodar. Depending on your previous bowel habits, they may want you to start taking constipation medicine before you start taking Temodar. You may need to take a stool softener or other medicine once or twice daily. Follow all instructions about when and how to take your medications and follow your bowel program carefully.

, If your constipation persists despite your best efforts and it’s been 3 days or longer since your last bowel movement, see your doctor. They may prescribe you a strong laxative or offer other advice on fixing the problem.Also seek immediate medical care if you experience any of the following:Fever of 104°F (40°C) or higher
You are unable to pass gas, have pain in your stomach, or have nausea or vomiting with your constipation
Your stomach feels tense or hard when you press it, or it feels swollen

Scrub for at least 20 seconds.Rinse hands thoroughly under warm water. Be sure that all soap is washed off, and any visible dirt is gone.
Dry hands with a clean, disposable paper towel.;
, Wearing latex or nitrile gloves prevents germs from being passed to the patient, and also protects the person administering medication.Be sure that your patient does not have a latex allergy before using latex gloves.

, Taking non-sublingual medications under the tongue can reduce the efficacy of that medication. Common sublingual medications include:


heart medication (such as nitroglycerin and verapamil)
certain steroids
certain opioids
certain barbiturates
enzymes
certain vitamins and minerals
certain mental health medications, Before taking or administering any medication, it is important to confirm that the correct dosage is prepared and is being taken/given at the proper intervals.

, Some oral medications only require that a portion of the pill be taken, if it is being administered sublingually. If this is the case, you may need to cut the pill before it can be taken.Use a pill cutter if at all possible. This is more precise than simply breaking a pill apart by hand or using a knife.
Clean the blade before and after cutting the pill. This is important, both to prevent the pill from being contaminated and from accidentally contaminating other medications.

, The person taking any medication should always be situated in an upright sitting position before medication is administered.Do not allow the individual to lie down or try to administer the medication when the person is unconscious. This could lead to accidental aspiration of the medication.

, Rinse your mouth out with water prior to administering medication. It's important not to eat or drink when sublingual medication is administered because this increases the risk of the medication being swallowed, which will make it less effective., Cigarette smoke constricts the blood vessels and mucous membranes in the mouth, which will reduce the absorption level of the sublingual medication., Because sublingual medication is administered in the mouth, patients with open mouth sores may experience pain or irritation.Eating, drinking, and smoking can all interfere with absorption and dosage rates. It is generally recommended that sublingual medications should not be used for prolonged periods of time., Medication can be administered on either side of the frenulum (the connective tissue under the tongue).


Tilt head forward to avoid swallowing medication.

, Most medications should have a dissolve time of approximately one to three minutes.Avoid opening the mouth, eating, talking, moving or standing during this time to ensure that the tablet doesn't move and has time to dissolve completely and be absorbed.


The onset of action of sublingual nitroglycerin is within 5 minutes and the duration can last up to 30 minutes. The amount of time it takes to dissolve may vary from one medication to the next. Consult with a pharmacist or talk to your doctor about how long it will take for your medication to dissolve sublingually.
If the sublingual nitroglycerin is potent a subtle tingling sensation should be felt on the tongue.

, Sublingual medication needs to be absorbed under the tongue.


Swallowing sublingual medication may cause erratic or incomplete absorption and could lead to improper dosing.Ask your doctor or a pharmacist how to correct your dosage in case of accidental swallowing of sublingual medication.

Try soft food.,
Practice with small candy first.,
Eat mandarin oranges.",How to Swallow a Pill1," If you are trying to take a pill and just can't seem to get it to go down, try using a piece of bread. Pull off a small piece of bread and chew it until you are ready to swallow. Before you swallow, take your pill and stick it in the mass of bread in your mouth. Once you close you mouth, swallow the food with the pill inside. The pill should go down smoothly.You can also use pieces of a bagel, a cracker, or a cookie as well. The texture is similar enough to help the pill go down once the food is chewed.
You can also take a drink of water afterward to help it go down easier.
Some medications need to be taken on an empty stomach. Check the bottle of your medication to see if you need to take your medicine on an empty stomach.;
, To help you swallow a pill, you can stick it inside a gummy bear. Take the gummy bear and cut a small pocket in the stomach of the bear. Slip the pill inside. Eat the gummy bear, but don't chew it; chewing some medication will change the duration and timing onset of the medication. Just try to swallow it, then once it's in your throat quickly drink your water.This may be difficult if you can't swallow the gummy bear. It may take practice.
This method is especially helpful for children. Helping mask the pill taking act with a gummy bear will help ease her into taking her medication.

, Pills can be taken with honey or peanut butter because they ease the passage of the pill down your throat. Get a spoon full of either food. Place the pill in the middle of dollop of food you have on the spoon. Make sure to push it into the food. Next, swallow the spoonful of honey or peanut butter with the pill inside. Wash down with water.You should drink water before and after this method. The honey and peanut butter are relatively thick and can feel slow going down. Hydrating your throat beforehand and after will help get the food down quicker and without choking.

, If you can't take your pill with bread, try taking it in a soft food such as applesauce, yogurt, ice cream, pudding, or gelatin. This is a common method used in hospitals for patients who have difficulty in swallowing. Make a small dish of the food. Drop the pill into the dish. Eat a little bit of the food before you take the bite with the pill in it. Then take the bite with the pill in it. It should go down easily with the food when you swallow.Make sure you don't chew in the pill.

, One of the main reasons people find it difficult to swallow pills is because their throats reject the intrusion of the pill and tense up. In order to overcome this, you can practice swallowing small candies to familiarize your throat with swallowing something whole without the risk of choking or injury. Take a small candy such as a sprinkle, a mini M&M, or a Nerd. Put them in your mouth like a pill and swallow it with a drink of water. Repeat until you feel comfortable with this size.


Next, you move up to a slightly larger sized candy such as a Skittle, regular M&M, Jelly Belly jelly bean, or Tic Tac. Repeat the same procedure with this size until you feel comfortable.Practice every day for about 10 minutes until you're swallowing a piece of candy that's the same size and shape of the pill you need to take.
This can help children work up to taking medication. Just make sure you explain that taking medication is serious and that pills should not be thought of as candy.

, Try swallowing mandarin orange segments whole. After you get used to that, put your pill into an orange segment and swallow it whole. The slimy texture of the mandarin orange will ease the passage of the pill and make it easy to swallow.Drink water afterwards to ensure it goes down as easily as possible.

Talk to your doctor about storing your meds if you have any questions.


Some medication, such as birth control, needs to be taken every day and some meds need to be taken around the same time. You may be tempted to keep your medication on hand, in your purse or wallet, but make sure this is safe first. Sometimes, medication needs to be kept at room temperature and is less effective if exposed to intense heat or cold.Medication might need to be kept at a specific temperature, which might mean it needs to be refrigerated or kept in a cool room of the house. Make sure you know what temperatures are appropriate for storing your medication., A pillbox is a storage device sold at most drug and department stores. It can be a great tool to keep track of what medication you need and when.


Pillboxes have separate compartments for each day of the week. At the beginning of each week, separate your pills into the proper dosages. Put those dosages in the pillbox, on the correct day they need to be taken.A pillbox is particularly great if you need to manage multiple medications, each with its own schedule. Simply place different medications in different sections, corresponding to the day of the week they need to be taken.

, Leave reminders throughout the house in places where you know you'll look often.

If you work at a desk frequently, having an index card propped up by your computer each week advising you when to take your meds can be a great reminder., You're more likely to remember your medication if it's part of an established routine. Adding taking your meds into an existing daily ritual can serve as a great reminder.


Try to take your medicine the same time each day and do so while you're doing other daily events. For example, take your medication before you brush your teeth. (But don't store your meds by the sink or you could knock over the bottle and spill them down the drain!) If you have medication that needs to be taken with food, always take it with breakfast or lunch.Many people incorporate a self-care ritual into their daily lives. Self-care is a simple, daily activity in which you take time to relax and reflect. For example, you could have hot tea, walk around the block, take a relaxing bath. If you practice self-care each day, try taking your pills just before or after your ritual., Friends and family members care about your health as much as you do. Having a trusted friend or family member remind you each day to take your medication can be helpful.


Select someone who is non-judgmental and positive. You do not want someone who is going to be hard on you if you forget.

If you do not, however, you can ask for a simple text or phone call as a reminder., Technology can be used to your advantage in regards to remembering medication. Try setting reminders using your watch, clock, phone, or computer.


Most modern cell phones and computers have a system in place where you can set reminders. If you're not sure how to use your phone or computer to set reminders, simply google instructions. You can have a song or alarm play when the time comes to take your meds.
If you have an alarm clock, you can set it to go off each day at a certain time as a reminder to take your medication. Many digital watches are equipped with alarms that can buzz or ring at specific times throughout the day.

, There are many electronic medicine schedules that can be set up using the internet. The internet in general can provide a lot of helpful tools in regards to medication.


Daily emails or other reminders can be sent through an online server. There are also many websites that make automated medication schedules for you that can be generated by entering your medications, how often you need to take them, and their dosage. Schedules can be accessed online or printed out for your reference.
You can also access forums or groups on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media sites that allow you to discuss medications and any issues you're having with other patients. Be aware that such sites should never replace medical advice; however, they can be a good place to go for emotional support and tips on how to remember to take meds. The primary conversation regarding medication should be with your doctor. If you hear about something online that you'd like to try (from herbal supplements to altering your dosage to anything else regarding your health) speak with your doctor before proceeding.

Sip cool water.,
Try the two gulp method.,
Use a straw.,
Drink a lot of water first.,
Help your child swallow a pill.",How to Swallow a Pill2," When you are taking medication, you need to make sure that your throat is as hydrated as possible to ease the passage of the pill. Sip from your water a few times before trying to take the pill. Place the pill on the back of your tongue, then drink water until you swallow the pill.


Take a few additional gulps after the pill is in your throat to help it move down.
The water should be cool or room temperature, but not cold or hot., Take your pill and place it on your tongue. Take a huge gulp of water and swallow the water, but not the pill. Next, take another gulp of water and swallow it and the pill. Take one last normal drink of water to help the passage of the pill.


This method opens up your throat wider with the first swallow, which allows the pill to ease down your throat, which is not larger, on the second swallow., For some people, using a straw to drink water or a beverage helps the pill to go down better. Place the pill on the back of your tongue. Drink something through a straw and swallow the liquid and the pill. Keep drinking for a few sips after you swallow it to help the pill go down.


The suction used to pull the liquid through the straw makes it easier to swallow the pill., Some people find that a lot of water helps ease the passage of the pill. Drink a mouthful of the water. Open the edge of your lip slightly to slip the pill into your mouth. Next, swallow the mouthful of water and the pill.


If the pill feels lodged in your throat, you can drink more water after you swallow the pill.
Fill your mouth about 80% with water. If you overfill your mouth, you will not be able to swallow all the water at once, and the method may be less effective.
You may be able to feel either the water or the pill in your throat. This does not usually trigger the gag reflex and is perfectly harmless.
You can use this method with drinks other than water., Children as small as 3 years old may have to take a pill. At this age, you child may find it difficult to comprehend swallowing a pill or may be afraid of choking. If this is the case, help them understand what is happening. A simple way to help them swallow a pill is to give them a drink of water and tell her to hold it in her mouth while she looks up at the ceiling. Slip the pill in the side of her mouth and wait for the pill to settle in the back of her throat. After a few moments, tell her to swallow, and the pill should go down her throat with the water.You can try any of the other methods with food or drink on your child unless it says otherwise.

Try the pop-bottle method.,
Use the lean-forward method.,
Relax.,
Calm your fears.,
Find alternatives to pills.",How to Swallow a Pill3," Fill a plastic bottle with water. Put the pill on your tongue. Next, close your lips snugly around the opening of the water bottle. Put your head back and take a drink of the water. Keep your lips lightly around the bottle opening and use suction to pull the water into your mouth. The water and the pill should go down your throat.


Don't let air into the bottle when you take a drink.
This method is best when used with large tablets.The suction action of your drink of water will open your throat wider and help you swallow the pill better.
This method is not intended for children. Only older individuals should attempt this method.

, For this method, place the pill on your tongue. Take a drink of water but don't swallow it yet. Tilt your head down with your chin towards your chest. Let the capsule float to the back of your mouth and then swallow the pill.


This method works best on pills in capsule form.You can try this method on your child as well. After she takes a sip of water, just have her stare at the floor while you slip the capsule in the side of her mouth. The pill will float and she can swallow it and the water., Anxiety can be a significant factor in preventing an individual from swallowing a pill. Relaxation is important. If you are anxious, your body will be tense and you will have more trouble swallowing the pill. In order to prevent this, you need to relax. Sit down with a glass of water and do whatever you can to ease any anxiety. Find a quiet place, listen to music that calms you, or meditate.


This will help soothe your nerves and break the association of pill time being stressful, so your body will be less likely to gag.
If you are having trouble, you can talk to a psychologist to help you break through your anxiety about taking a pill.If you are trying to help a child swallow a pill, help make them feel comfortable by getting her mind off of the act before asking her to do it. Read her a story, play a game, or find some other activity that helps her relax before asking her to take the pill. The calmer she is, the more likely she will be to take the pill.

, You may be worried that a pill will not fit down your throat, especially if it is a large pill. To help you squash this fear, stand in front of a mirror. Open your mouth and say ""ahhhhh."" This will show you how wide your throat is and should show that a pill can clearly fit down it.You can also use a mirror to place the pills on your tongue. The farther back you put the pill, the shorter ways it has to go before you swallow it.
You can also do this with a child who is terrified of choking. Do it along with her to show that you understand her fears, but convince her that there is nothing to fear.

, There are many medications that are available in multiple forms. You may be able to get your medication as a liquid, a patch, a cream, an inhaled version, a suppository, or a dispersible, which is a pill that dissolved in water. Talk to your doctor about your options, especially if you have a hard time swallowing pills, no matter what method you try.Don't take a pill and try to use it in any other way unless your doctor says you can. Don't crush pills to make them a dispersible or try to use a pill as a suppository that isn't supposed to be. Always consult your doctor before you change the way in which you take medication.

Consult with your doctor.,
Talk with your pharmacist.,
Discuss supplements with a naturopathic doctor.,
Research possible interactions.,
Track your prescriptions and supplements.,
Watch for signs of interactions.,
Check for garlic interactions.,
Consider interactions from ginko biloba.,
Monitor interactions from ginseng.,
Check for hawthorn (crataegus) interactions.,
Consider interactions from St John's wort.",How to Avoid Interactions Between Prescriptions and Supplements," Talk to all of your healthcare professionals before you begin taking any vitamins, minerals, or supplements. This is especially important if your doctor is prescribing a new medication. Your doctor is one of the most qualified people to advise you about possible interactions. Your doctor can also tell you if any problems you may be having are related to interactions.For example, if you are taking an antidepressant like citalopram and are also taking St John’s wort, there is an increased risk of side effects, including a dangerous condition known as serotonin syndrome. If you haven't told any of your physicians about taking St John’s wort, that lack of information could potentially delay a diagnosis.;
, You could also tell your pharmacist all the medications and supplements you're taking and ask the pharmacist to check for interactions. Pharmacists are trained medication specialists who have lots of resources available. They can use these to determine your risk for significant interactions.Your pharmacist can also give you detailed instructions about how to take your medication, what side effects you can expect, and dosing information.

, While most people don't need a multi-vitamin or multi-mineral, you might benefit from adding vitamins or minerals so long as you follow your naturopathic doctor or general practicioner's recommendations. Always follow the dosing instructions and don't be tempted to take more just because it's natural.Taking too many vitamins (like vitamin A, K, E, and D), mineral, or iron can cause toxic levels to be stored in your body.
If you work with a naturopathic physician, the doctor has been trained in prescription, herbal, and botanical medicines and supplements.

, In addition to talking to your medical team, check online resources for interactions between prescriptions and supplements. Ask your doctor to recommend a reputable database or look for a government or scientifically-backed database like:


MedWatch, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program, http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/default.htm

Medline Plus, an Interaction Checker from the US National Library of Medicine, https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/drug_Wa.html

Mayo Clinic Interaction Checker http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/in-depth/herbal-supplements/art-20046488


, Keep track of your prescriptions and all supplements you take. Keep this list on you at all times in case of an emergency. You should also pay attention to any new symptoms, especially when starting a new prescription or supplement.Remember to write down the dosage for each medication or supplement you take.

, Look for any health changes like changes in blood pressure, nausea, rashes, headaches, changes in blood sugar, and any symptoms that concern you. Refer back to written list of what prescriptions and supplements you were taking when symptoms first appeared.If you do experience any unusual symptoms or interactions, contact your physician right away.

, Garlic is often taken as a supplement to lower cholesterol and reduce the risk for heart disease. You may increase your risk for bleeding if you supplement with garlic while taking blood-thinning medications like warfarin and aspirin. You should also talk with your doctor if you're using:Antiplatelet medications like indomethacin, dipyridamole, and clopridogrel.
Protease inhibitors (treatment for HIV) like indinavir, ritinavir, and saquinavir.

, Ginko is often used to improve memory, reduce general anxiety and improve the metabolism. There are many drugs that interact with ginko and could cause bleeding, changes in blood pressure and blood sugar, and seratonin syndrome. Talk with your doctor if you're taking:Anticonvulsant medications
Antidepressant medications
Antihypertensive medications
Blood-thinning medications (including aspirin)
Blood-thinning medications

, If you're getting cancer treatments, you may be using ginseng to fight fatigue. But, studies have shown that it can decrease the effectiveness of warfarin, a blood thinner that treats or prevents blood clots. You should also avoid taking ginseng with aspirin which is also a blood thinner.You should also avoid using ginseng while taking heart or psychiatric medications. Consider avoiding caffeine since ginseng and caffeine can overstimulate your nervous system.

, Hawthorn is currently being studied as a way to complement cardiovascular disease treatments although it's been used for hundreds of years to treat heart and respiratory diseases. Using hawthorn while taking the following medications can make their effects stronger:

Beta blockers: aenolol, nadolol, propranolol
Calcium channel blockers: diltiazem, nifedipine, verapamil
Digoxin: lanoxicaps, lanoxin
Phenylephrine
Medications for male sexual dysfunction

, St. John's wort is a popular supplement for treating depression, minor wounds, and menopausal and premenstrual symptoms. St. John's wort can reduce the effectiveness of calcium channel blockers, digoxin, warfarin, and statins. But, it can make the effects of other medications stronger (like anticonvulsants, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, insomnia medications, alcohol, and tricyclic antidepressants). It can also increase the risk of side effects for:Citalopram
Escitalopram
Fluvoxamine
Paroxetine
Fluoxetine
Sertraline
Tricyclics
MAOIs

Position the applicator in the nostril.Lean your head slightly forward and carefully place the nasal applicator into one nostril.,
Administer the drug.Breathe in through your nose while pressing the pump to spray the drug into your nostril.,
Keep the applicator clean.Improper hygiene can increase the chances of infection with repeated usage.,
Report illness immediately.,
Avoid infectious germs and diseases.,
Report Flonase use before surgeries or emergency treatment.In rare cases, prolonged use of corticosteroids decreases your body's ability to respond to physical stress.",How to Avoid Side Effects when Using Flonase (Fluticasone)," It's a corticosteroid that stops your body from releasing the chemicals that cause allergies.It is specific to symptoms caused by allergies, and will not relieve similar symptoms with other causes. For example, it will stop a runny nose from allergies, but not from a cold. In the past, doctors prescribed it if you had constant allergy symptoms that don't respond to over the counter (OTC) medications. Recently, though, Flonase was approved for over the counter use, and may be available at your pharmacy.


Intranasal steroids (INS) like Flonase act on many inflammatory substances and help block the the body from producing them while antihistamines block only the histamine release.;
, Because it is administered as a nasal spray, you may experience nosebleeds, headaches, sneezing, and dry or irritated nose and throat. Because it is a corticosteroid, you may experience upper respiratory infections, cataracts or glaucoma, and slower growth rate in children who use it for a prolonged time period. Less common side effects also include diarrhea and abdominal pain.


Nosebleeds are the most common side effect from using Flonase.If you experience other side effects from the medication, such as cough, fever, headache or muscle aches, sore throat, or fatigue, see your doctor., Include any vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you take or have recently taken. Physicians and pharmacists can review medication lists to ensure no interactions occur between medication that are taken.Some drugs (HIV drugs and antifungals, for example) may interact negatively with Flonase, so you and your doctor will need to come up with a plan to manage interactions or alter treatment. It may be as simple as changing your dosage and monitoring for side effects.

, Flonase may also cause unwanted side effects if you have or previously had certain medical conditions. If you have a compromised immune system, use of a corticosteroid could lower the body's ability to fight infection. Provide the doctor with a detailed medical history. Make sure to note any of the following conditions known to interact poorly with Flonase:Cataracts (clouding in the lens of your eye)
Glaucoma (an eye fluid-pressure disease)
Current nose sores
Any type of untreated infection
Herpes infection in the eye
Recent nose surgery or injury
Previous diagnosis of tuberculosis (a type of infection) in your lungs
Pregnancy, breastfeeding, or plan to become pregnant. If you become pregnant while using fluticasone, call your doctor immediately., Read the instructions on the packaging and follow the dosing schedule, or follow your doctor or pharmacist's instructions precisely. Ask questions about anything you may not understand to ensure you're using the drug properly.


Do not use Flonase any more or less in either amount or frequency than your doctor has prescribed.

, Flonase is not meant to be swallowed, though, and this may cause unwanted side effects. Instead of swallowing, spit it out into the sink and rinse your mouth out.


Also be careful not to get it in your eyes or mouth. Rinse thoroughly if you do.

, Don't expect it to immediately cure all of your symptoms. Your symptoms may lessen the after the first 12 hours but it will take at least several days to see the full benefit. Allow a few days for Flonase to work, and use it regularly on the prescribed schedule. It's important to continue using fluticasone even when you feel well, or symptoms may return. Don't stop using it without first talking to your doctor. After a period of time, he may recommend decreasing your dosage., Be especially alert if you've overused it or if you develop sensitivity. Common side effects include headache, dryness or burning of the nasal passage, nosebleed, dizziness, upper respiratory infections, nausea and vomiting.If any of these side effects are severe, contact your doctor right away. However, if you experience any of the following severe side effects, stop using the drug and contact your doctor:


Swelling of face, neck, feet, or ankles
Difficulty breathing or swallowing
Wheezing breaths
Fatigue
Hives
Fever
Unexpected bruising.

, You do this for the same reason you may shake a juice before drinking it. Liquid mixtures sometimes separate a bit, and shaking ensures an even distribution of ingredients. This is especially important with medication. Remove the sprayer's dust cover after shaking the bottle.

, Hold the pump applicator vertically between your forefinger and middle finger. The bottom of the bottle should be supported by your thumb. Point the spray nozzle away from your face and body.


The very first time you use a new bottle, press down on the pump six times to let off pressure.
To re-prime a bottle you've used before, press down and release the pump until you see a fine spray.

, Otherwise, the medication might get caught in the front of the nostril, where it will be less effective. Blow your nose until you have completely cleared your nostrils.


Do not blow your nose after using the spray., Be sure to keep the bottle upright, and hold the other nostril closed with a finger. You should be holding the pump with the applicator between your forefinger and middle finger, and the bottom supported by your thumb.

, Take a normal breath in through that nostril, but breathe out through your mouth. This prevents you from blowing the medication back out through your nose. Repeat the steps in the other nostril.

, Every time you finish using the applicator, wipe it with a clean tissue and replace the dust cover. At least once a week, you should clean your nasal spray applicator with warm water. Remove the cap, then pull on the applicator (tip) to remove it. Wash the cap and applicator in warm water. Dry them at room temperature, and then put them back on the bottle.

, Since Flonase is a corticosteroid and may decrease your body’s ability to fight infections, you need to take extra precautions while using it. If you get sick, let your doctor know immediately. You should always give healthcare providers a complete list of medications you're taking. Remember to include fluticasone inhalation/spray on your list.

, Stay away from people who are sick and wash your hands often. Be especially careful to stay away from people who have chickenpox or measles. Tell your doctor right away if you find out that you have been around someone who has one of these viruses., As such, it's very important that your doctors know you're using Flonase before you undergo any surgery (including dental surgery) or emergency treatment.

Identify symptoms of testicular torsion.,
Call for help immediately.,
Take pain medication.,
Secure the testicle.,
Rest as much as possible.,
Decrease movement.,
Drink only as necessary.,
Attempt manual detorsion.,
Acknowledge your risk.,
Protect your testicles.,
Avoid overly vigorous activity.,
Maintain body temperature.,
Undergo attachment surgery.",How to Treat Torsion of the Testis in the Wilderness," You may have had testicular torsion in the past or this could be your first experience with it. Identifying the symptoms quickly and getting medical attention can help you minimize the risk of more harmful outcomes, such as loss of your testicle.The symptoms and signs of testicular torsion include:


Sudden and severe pain in the scrotum
Swelling of the scrotum
Abdominal pain
Nausea and vomiting
Higher testicle position than normal
Testicle positioning at an unusual angle
Painful urination
Fever;
, If you experience any of the signs of testicular torsion, it is absolutely vital to call for help as soon as possible because you have a six to eight hour window before before damage begins to occur.This can minimize your risk of losing your testicle or harming your ability to have children.Check to see if you or another person has cell phone reception. This can be a particular problem in the wilderness. Getting to the highest point visible may help you.
If you or no else has phone reception, get to the nearest ranger station. Rangers often have satellite phones and medical equipment that may help comfort you while you wait for emergency medical personnel.
Testicular torsion requires medical treatment and often surgery, so it’s vital that you contact medical personnel as soon as possible., Testicular torsion is often very painful. Taking an over-the-counter pain medication may help reduce pain until you can see a doctor and get treatment for the condition.


Take aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen sodium for the pain.
Ibuprofen or naproxen sodium may help relieve related swelling.

, Testicles that are not secured to the scrotum can cause torsion.Securing your testicles to your body until you can get out of the wilderness may minimize the risk of your testicle(s) further rotating on itself.Wrap a towel or other fabric around the affected testicle. You may need to secure this to your body in order to maintain stability.
Keeping the testicle secure and restricting movement can alleviate some of the pain experienced when walking or sitting.

, Movement or vigorous activity can cause testicular torsion.Rest to minimize the risk of further rotating your scrotum.Before you move to a ranger station or another more secure location in the wilderness, rest for a bit. This may help calm you down as well.

, If you have to move to get to a ranger station or more secure location, walk as slowly as possible.This can minimize the possibility of further rotating your scrotum and may alleviate discomfort.Walk on ground that is as level as possible and take care with each step.
If you are with others, ask them to support you while you walk.

, Drinking excessive liquids can add pressure to your bladder and genital area, and urination may be painful. Drink only as necessary so as not to increase pain of further rotate your testicle.


If you are taking a pain reliever, only drink enough to get the pill into your system.

, If you cannot get to a doctor quickly because you are in an especially remote area, consider trying to rotate your testicle back into its proper position. Be aware that this can be quite painful and doesn’t come without risks.Place your testicles in your hands as though you are holding a book.
Turn your testicles from the midline of your body towards the outside, or medial to lateral sides.Use an action that is similar to opening a book.If manual detorsion is too painful or your experience symptoms such as vomiting or fainting, discontinue the procedure immediately.
Manual detorsion doesn’t replace getting proper medical attention.Successful detorsion s marked by reduction in pain and lower position of the testes in the scrotum.

, Knowing your relative risk for experiencing testicular torsion may help prevent it. Although in some cases there is no clear cause or risk for testicular torsion, the following factors may make your more likely to have testicular torsion:Age. Torsion is most common in babies and at the onset of puberty.Defects to the connective tissue in the scrotum.Injury to the scrotum.Family historyPrior cases of torsion, Torsion can often occur following a minor injury or even during sleep.Protecting your testicles with athletic cups or more supportive underwear may help minimize your risk for torsion.Wear an athletic cup whenever you play contact sports such as football or soccer.Wear either “tighty whiteys” (briefs) or boxer-briefs to help support your testicles and minimize the risk of your testicles rotating.Wear underwear while you sleep.

, Exercise or other activities that are especially vigorous can cause testicular torsion. Stay away from any activity that may move your testicles in a manner that could promote torsion.If you are a runner or play sports that involve a lot of running, consider wearing more supportive undergarments to minimize your risk.
Be aware that general physical activity will not cause torsion, as it can occur when you are sitting, standing, sleeping, or doing exercise.In fact, a typical presentation of torsion is to be awoken in the early morning or at night with scrotal pain.

, Cold temperatures can exacerbate your risk for testicular torsion. Keeping your body—and testicles—at their normal temperature may help minimize your risk for developing the condition.Try not to sit on cold surfaces, especially during the winter. You might want to avoid other surfaces that don’t conduct as much heat, such as rocks or stones.If you are out in the wilderness during the winter, make sure to wear proper clothing to keep your testicles from getting cold. Wear pants and supportive underwear that keep your testicles close to your body.

, In many cases, surgery can prevent testicular torsion.Discuss this option with your doctor if you know you are at risk or have experienced testicular torsion in the past.


The surgical procedure, which requires staying in the hospital, will attach both sides of your testicles to the inside of the scrotum.See a urologist, who is a specialist for male genitalia, to discuss your options."

Understand precisely your dosages and the time and day you take it.,
Know the sides effects of warfarin and how to handle them.,
If you're bleeding, apply more pressure for a longer period of time.,
Make changes to your diet by limiting foods and beverages high in vitamin K. Warfarin works by interfering with clotting factors dependent on vitamin K. In other words, having a high-vitamin-K diet can negatively affect the way warfarin clots your blood.,
Avoid taking other medications that may interact with warfarin.,
Go for regular blood tests to check your INR/prothrombin time.,
Wear a medical necklace/bracelet that says you are on the anticoagulant warfarin.",How to Live with Warfarin," Many people on warfarin are given two different dosages and must take them on alternating days. For example, one may take 2 mg every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and 3 mg every Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. Be sure to take the dosage at the required time.;
, The most common side effect is bleeding (see next step). Other side effects are tiredness, nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite.


A serious side effect is necrosis (death of skin or other body tissues. If you notice a darkened colour to your skin, other skin changes, sudden severe pain, or if your extremities become painful or dark, call a doctor and get medical attention immediately.

, Because warfarin decreases your ability to clot blood, it will take longer than usual to stop bleeding. Continue adding direct pressure to the wound.


Check for signs of internal bleeding. Check your urine and stool every time you go to the bathroom for the presence of any blood (pinkish, red, or brown urine, bloody or red stool). Inspect your entire body for bruises, especially if you've been injured.

,


You do not necessarily need to avoid vitamin K altogether. The important thing is to have a consistent diet that contains balanced amounts of vitamin K.
Examples of foods high in vitamin K: dark green, leafy vegetables (for example, spinach, kale, broccoli, Brussels sprouts), green tea, liver, cauliflower.
Limit the amount of alcohol you drink. Small amounts are okay.

, This includes prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, and herbal medicines. Ask your doctor before taking new medications or inform your pharmacist that you're taking warfarin before buying OTC medications.

, This is a test done in a medical lab to see how well the warfarin is ""thinning"" your blood. For most people, a normal INR is between 2 and 3, but it may depend on your dosages. After the blood work, your doctor may phone you the results. If it's out of your normal range, consider changing your diet or following up with the doctor to adjust your dosage.


The reason for this test is because there is a small window for warfarin to efficiently work. If your INR is too high, your dose may be too much and you could be more prone to severe bleeding. If your INR is too low, however, the dose may be too little and you could risk getting a blood clot in your veins or lungs.
The frequency of these tests will change as your body becomes more accustomed to the therapy. When you've just been prescribed the medication, your doctor may order blood tests every day. As you get more and more used to warfarin, you may only need to get a blood test every month.

, In case of a medical emergency that requires a 911 call (call to Emergency services), this alerts EMTs that you're on warfarin so that they don't give you medications that could possibly interact harmfully with it. Also, tell your dentist that you're taking warfarin before undergoing any dental procedure.

Learn what the reported cause of male menopause is.,
Know the symptoms of male menopause.,
Learn about a potential diagnosis.,
Seek treatment for the condition.

,
If your doctor determines that your testosterone levels are low, he or she may prescribe testosterone replacement therapy.

,
Testosterone replacement therapy does come with potential risks and side effects, though, including a higher risk of prostate cancer.

,
Alternately, your doctor may suggest lifestyle changes instead of, or in conjunction with, your hormone replacement therapy.",How to Understand Male Menopause,"


Doctors describe male menopause as a reduction in androgen, also known as testosterone, as men get older. This condition is also referred to as low testosterone.
Low testosterone is associated with advanced age, but it can also occur with some diseases such as diabetes. Most men can produce sperm very late in life, so male menopause is a much more gradual process than female menopause, which occurs over a distinct, much briefer time period.;
, Males going through male menopause report feelings of weakness, depression, fatigue and sexual issues.


In regards to sexual function, your testes may appear smaller, you may have a reduced amount of sexual desire, infertility and/or you may experience fewer spontaneous erections like those that occur in the middle of the night.
The low testosterone levels affiliated with male menopause can sometimes cause insomnia.
Physical changes affiliated with male menopause can include a reduction in muscle bulk, decreased bone density and increased body fat as symptoms. Those affected may have swollen or tender breasts and/or experience hair loss. Hot flashes and loss of energy have also been described with male menopause.
Emotional changes that may occur with male menopause can include decreased motivation and/or self-confidence. Sadness, depression and loss of concentration may also occur.

, Visit your doctor to discuss symptoms and get an exam.


Your doctor may run other tests to rule out any other conditions.
Specific to the male menopause, your doctor can order blood tests to test your hormone level, including a blood testosterone level test.

,,,, These lifestyle changes may include an exercise program or a new diet.

"
"
Have your testosterone levels checked.Before you will even be eligible to consider testosterone therapy (as prescribed by a medical doctor), you will need to have your testosterone levels checked via a blood test.,
Get a repeat blood test.If your first blood test does come back showing low testosterone, your doctor will ask that you get a repeat blood test.,
Discuss with your doctor the pros and cons of receiving treatment.Although testosterone may help with libido, erections, and building muscle mass, among other things, there are also risks involved to undergoing the therapy.,
Decide upon a route of administration.If you and your doctor jointly decide that it is in your best interest to proceed with testosterone replacement therapy, you will next need to decide how you would like to receive the testosterone.,
Receive testosterone through your skin.One of the simplest ways to receive your testosterone is through your skin.,
Have testosterone injected or implanted into your body.Another option is to receive testosterone injections every one to three weeks.,
Understand the risk of receiving testosterone orally.Some people may wonder why testosterone therapy is not offered via pills.,
Observe changes to your sexual function.One of the main ways in which low testosterone can manifest is as a low sexual desire and/or reduced spontaneous erections, or trouble with erections overall.,
Make note of changes to your sleep and energy levels.Low testosterone can also lead to problems sleeping and even insomnia.,
Be aware of changes to your mood.Low testosterone may contribute to depression, irritability, and/or difficulty concentrating.,
Notice changes to your physical body.If you have unexplained hair loss, or an unusual decline in your body's strength and muscle mass along with an increase in fat mass, this may be a sign that your testosterone levels are low.,
Consider testosterone therapy for gender identity purposes.If you were assigned female at birth, but identify more with the male gender (such as if you are transgender or genderqueer), testosterone therapy may be something that you would like to consider.,
Know the effects that testosterone therapy can provide.Undergoing testosterone therapy will increase your facial hair and your overall body hair, will lower your voice, will likely increase your libido, will stop your menstruation, and may enlarge your clitoris (called ""clitoromegaly"").,
Get approved for the treatment.If you have decided that testosterone therapy is something you would like to go forward with, it is important to have this discussion with your doctor.",How to Undergo Testosterone Therapy," You are likely noticing symptoms that are potentially correlated to decreased testosterone, such as a decreased libido and/or less spontaneous erections. However, until low testosterone has been confirmed via a blood test as the cause of these issues, you will not be able to move forward with therapy.


The reason for this is that there is mixed evidence around testosterone therapy, and there are potential risks involved.
Therefore, until your doctor is sure that abnormally low testosterone is the real issue behind your symptoms, he or she will likely not advise that you proceed straight to treatment.
Note that testosterone therapy is not advised as a means to treat natural age-related changes in men.
The decline in testosterone in men is sometimes referred to as “andropause” or “late-onset hypogonadism.” Consequences of “male menopause” include sexual dysfunction, bone mineral density problems, a higher risk of bone fractures, an increase in fat mass, a decrease in muscle mass, and a decline in cognitive function.;
, This is to confirm the diagnosis, and to ensure that it was not simply a one-time low reading, or a laboratory error (although these are uncommon). If both of your blood tests show low testosterone, you and your doctor can proceed to discussing the pros and cons of treatment so that you can make an informed decision as to whether or not this is something you would like to undergo.


Note that you are only eligible for testosterone replacement therapy if you have both symptoms that are linked to low testosterone and two blood tests demonstrating low levels.
One of the two criteria is not sufficient to proceed with medical treatment.

, The risks and possible side effects include:


Developing acne or other skin reactions.
Unwanted benign prostate growth, and/or growth of any existing prostate cancers.
A higher risk of sleep apnea (respiratory troubles leading to disrupted sleep).
Enlargement of your breast area.
Testicle shrinkage due to the presence of external testosterone.
An increased risk of blood clots in the legs and/or lungs. (Watch out for pain in your legs or calves.)
A possibly increased risk of heart disease.

, Testosterone replacement therapy is available in the form of injections, pellets, patches, or gels.

, There are patches you can apply through transdermal application (for absorption through your skin) - these are generally applied daily in small doses, so that you are receiving testosterone on a regular basis.


You can also apply a testosterone gel to your skin, if you prefer that to a patch.
Patches may also be placed inside your mouth for absorption through the oral mucosa.
The route of administration that you choose will depend on your personal preference.

, The shot is normally given into your gluteal muscle (the buttock). This can be done at your family doctor's office.


You can also have testosterone pellets inserted into your soft tissues.
The advantage of an injection or a pellet is that it can be done less frequently, and it is not something that you will have to remember on a daily basis.
The downside, however, is that it's a slightly more invasive method than simply absorbing testosterone through your skin.
Again, your chosen route of administration will depend on your personal preference.

, The reason for this is that it is thought that testosterone taken orally, and absorbed via your intestines, can put strain on your liver. To avoid this possible stress to your liver, either transdermal (through the skin) methods, or injections or implantations are preferred by medical professionals.

, Testosterone naturally declines in men as they age (testosterone levels decrease by about 1% per year after the age of 30 or 40). However, if you are noticing a significant decline in your sexual function, it is advisable to speak to your doctor about the possibility that you may have low testosterone.


Sexual function is measured by the frequency of your orgasms and sexual satisfaction.

, It may cause heightened daytime fatigue and an overall reduced energy level. If you notice these things happening to you, book an appointment with your family doctor, as they may be correlated with reduced or low testosterone.

, Testosterone plays a significant role in controlling mood and emotional states. Therefore, if you feel ""off"" emotionally and like your moods have declined, there is the possibility that this is related to low testosterone.


One study showed that testosterone can function as an antidepressant in men with depression and low testosterone., It is not a guarantee that the two are correlated, but it is worth exploring with your family doctor.

, Not all people who are assigned female at birth but identify as male feel that they need the more masculine physical appearance that testosterone therapy can provide; however, for many people in this boat, testosterone therapy is something that is desired.

, Possible side effects include sweating, headaches, the development of male pattern baldness, soreness at the injection site, increased acne or skin problems, and/or mood swings.The typical dosage is 200mg every two weeks; however, this can be adjusted by your physician as needed to obtain the desired effect.
You will likely learn how to self-inject your own testosterone. Alternatively, your doctor may teach a family member or friend how to do this for you, if you prefer not to do it on your own.

, He or she will go over the risks and benefits of treatment with you, to make sure you fully understand the impacts of testosterone therapy. Your doctor will also have you sign an informed consent form before proceeding.


Depending upon the rules in the area in which you live, you may be required to see a psychiatrist prior to receiving testosterone therapy for a mental and psychological evaluation.
It is also important to check whether or not you are eligible for healthcare coverage or insurance for medical therapies relating to ""gender dysphoria"" (identifying with a gender or sex other than that which is stated on your birth certificate).
Many times there is no coverage offered, so it is important to consider the costs of testosterone therapy when you make your decision.

Make a list of all the medications, vitamins and supplements you are taking, no matter how harmless it may be.,
Create a list of your food and drug allergies, and any medical conditions you have.,
Know the generic name and active ingredients of the drugs you often use.,
Show your information to the pharmacist.,
Ask about generics.,
Check the medication’s label and verify the dosage.,
Ask questions about your medication.",How to Get the Best Service at Your Pharmacy," This applies to birth control pills as well. Bring the list with you to the pharmacy.


Remember to list things you may be taking that you do not normally consider to be medication, like ginseng or St. John’s Wort.;
, Bring the list with you, then show it to the pharmacist before purchasing new medications.


Mention any food allergies you might have, especially if you are lactose intolerant.
Bring up an live and renal conditions.
Some mild antibiotics are OTC(over-the-counter). When buying any of these, it is very important to inform the pharmacist if you have a history of hypersensitivity or abnormal reactions to any antibiotic.
Inform the pharmacist about the age of anyone else you for whom you are buying medication.

, For example, a drug with a generic name ""acetylsalicylic acid"" may be sold under the brands Aspirin, Asperan, Acetisal, or many more.


The best way to do this is to write down the generic name on a note card as many medications have very similar names. This will ensure that you do not take the wrong medication.
Learn the ""active ingredient"" of your preferred medications and add them to your list as well.
Coming to the pharmacy with this information in advance will save you time there. Take a few minutes at home to write it down.

, After taking the time to compile the information in part one, make sure that you bring it to the pharmacy and show the pharmacist.


Tell your pharmacist if you have are pregnant or planning to become pregnant.
Your pharmacist may also want to see your insurance information. Have it ready to go.
Your pharmacist will need to know your information up front, so make sure you do this first!

, Many medications have generic versions, medicines that do not have the brand name, that are cheaper and just as effective. By mentioning the generic name of a drug, you will help the pharmacist suggest a proper substitute.
If the pharmacist offers a specific medication for your condition, ask for alternatives with the same active ingredient. Often there are cheaper substitutes for expensive drugs, their only downside being their less famous manufacturer.

, First, ensure you have the medication you expect. When buying prescription drugs, ask the pharmacist to write the appropriate dosage for each of them on the package. This way the pharmacist will be able to correct any possible mistakes on the prescription. This will also keep you from overdosing on a potentially dangerous or lethal drug you may have mistaken for harmless.


Confirm that you understand what “as directed” means, if you medication instructs you to use it “only as directed.” If you aren’t sure, ask the pharmacist.Each drug has a maximum daily dose, indicated in the patient leaflet.
Never change (increase or decrease) the dose prescribed by your doctor or your pharmacist.

, Your pharmacist can answer a variety of questions about what to take, and how to take it. Many pharmacies have a special area set aside for talking with the pharmacist. Use this area to speak with the pharmacist without interruption.Pharmacists are well trained to interact with their customers, and spend considerable time during the schooling on the topic. Take advantage of their expertise.Consider some of the following questions:


Are any interactions between the medicines I am currently taking and the one I am buying.
Does my medication need to be stored in a special way or place?
What are the potential side effects of the medication? What can I do to avoid them?
Should I take my medication with food? Liquids?What should I do if I miss a dose? "
"
Discuss your options with your medical team.,
Maintain active surveillance.,
Talk to your doctor about getting a prostatectomy.,
Kill cancer cells with radiation therapy.,
Talk to your doctor about undergoing chemotherapy.,
Look into joining a clinical trial.",How to Treat Prostate Cancer1," Before beginning any type of treatment, you should speak to all the doctors who will be involved in your treatment and care. Speak with your primary care doctor, your oncologist, and your urologist about which type of initial treatment will be best for you based on your overall health and the type and stage of your cancer.
, One of the best treatment methods for dealing with prostate cancer is simply monitoring the cancer to make sure it does not spread. Many men endure more aggressive treatment than is necessary to maintain their health.You and your doctor may try to avoid more immediate forms of treatment for low grades of prostate cancer.


Active surveillance will necessitate periodic blood tests, especially prostate specific antigen tests, and digital rectal examinations.
If your cancer is low in grade and volume, and you want to avoid urinary complications and possible problems with sexual function or fertility, actively surveil in the short term and reevaluate treatment options only if the cancer grows or causes other symptoms.
If you are older and have a limited life expectancy or are battling other serious medical conditions, it may be best to forego treatment and avoid the potential complications associated with other methods of cancer treatment.

, Consider surgery to remove all or part of your prostate. Undergoing radical prostatectomy, which involves the removal of the prostate and some surrounding tissue, is often recommended for those with cancer in an early stage that is confined to the prostate and may be fully removed.Radical retropubic prostatectomy requires an incision in the abdomen and the removal of the prostate, which lies behind the pubic bone.
Catheters are usually needed following radical prostatectomy to allow your urinary sphincters to acclimate to the new plumbing setup.
Variations on incision points and specific methods of surgery are important to consider with your doctor. In the past, different methods of entry to the body were more commonly used; today, robots are often used to assist with prostatectomies.
Work with a surgeon who has experience doing prostatectomies.

, Radiation therapy uses concentrated energy to kill cancer cells. There are several types of radiation therapy. Most commonly, an external machine will direct radiation beams directly at cancer cells. Internal brachytherapy allows the surgical implantation of radioactive material near the cancer cells to destroy the cancer at close proximity.External beam radiation therapy will require you to lie still while a machine moves around your body blasting high-powered x-rays or protons at your cancer. You may have to undergo this procedure multiple times over the course of many weeks, depending on how your cancer responds to the treatment.
Brachytherapy will require rice-sized “seeds” of radioactive material to be placed inside your prostate tissue via an ultrasound-guided needle. The seeds will deliver a constant, low dose of radiation for a while, and will eventually stop giving off radiation.
Computer software and 3-D modeling have helped radiation oncologists better plan and execute radiation therapies. Still, make sure you and your doctor have access to the latest technologies – some of which are not widely available.Be prepared for the side effects of radiation therapy, which may include painful, frequent, and urgent urination, rectal and stool variations, erectile dysfunction, fistula formation, inflammation of the bladder (cystitis), kidney stones, and more.

, This treatment method includes any use of chemicals prescribed as drugs to shrink or kill cancer. Drugs are administered intravenously, in pill form, or both, with the intent of stopping cancer cells from dividing and thus stopping the growth and spread of cancerous tumors.There are many different types of drugs used in chemotherapy. Research continually re-evaluates the effectiveness of various chemotherapy drugs, often in combination with one another.
Different regimens, sometimes only on a trial status, are designed to be more tolerable, or to be more effective against cancer at a specific stage.
If you decide to use chemotherapy, look to maximize potential benefits and minimize side effects, which can be severe.
Plan supplementary treatment approaches with your doctors to help cope with chemotherapy’s toll on your body.

, In some cases, your cancer may be too advanced to make you a good candidate for traditional therapeutic methods. If this is the case for you, you might consider enrolling in a clinical trial for an experimental medication or treatment. Even if the experimental treatment does not cure your cancer, the information derived from your participation in the trial may help others in the future."

Familiarize yourself with hormone therapy options.,
Consider cryotherapy.,
Use a focused ultrasound to kill cancer cells.,
Think about taking part in a clinical trial.,
Consider complementary options.",How to Treat Prostate Cancer2," Hormone therapy prevents cancer cells from getting the hormones, namely testosterone, that they need to grow. Cutting off or reducing the supply of these hormones can help kill or reduce the growth of cancer. There are several different types of hormone therapy.Consider an orchiectomy. The surgical removal of your testicles is an immediate way to reduce the amount of testosterone in your body.
With the guidance of a specialist, choose between medications that stop your body from producing testosterone (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists) and those that block testosterone from reaching the cancer cells (anti-androgens).
Consider hormone therapy as an especially viable option to fight advanced prostate cancer.
In some cases, your doctor may recommend using hormone therapy before radiation therapy to make radiation more successful. This type of treatment strategy is called neoadjuvant therapy.

, Otherwise known as cryosurgery, this treatment option involves the insertion of probes into the prostate. Argon gas or liquid nitrogen are then used to freeze the prostate and kill any tumor cells therein.Talk to your doctor about the potential risks of cryotherapy. The likelihood of erectile dysfunction and urinary complications are relatively high, and this treatment method has less certain long-term outcomes.
Consider cryotherapy as a secondary option, particularly following unsuccessful radiation therapy.
Those with early-stage cancer and well-confined tumors are more likely to benefit from this method of treatment.

, This treatment option focuses high-intensity sound waves on cancer cells to burn them to death. It requires a probe to be inserted into the rectum, from which a powerful ultrasound targets the prostate cancer.Though slow to take on elsewhere, this treatment option has demonstrated success in treating European patients.
Consider this a secondary treatment option, as potential side effects include erectile dysfunction and urinary complications, and this method is much less practiced then radiation therapy and other options.

, You can choose to take part in a controlled research study on new treatment options. Clinical trials are carefully controlled, and provide a cost-free way to get state-of-the art cancer treatments. In fact, some of the newest cancer treatments are only available as part of clinical trials.


Further, clinical trials also help the medical community learn more about cancer.
If you would be willing to take part in clinical trials at any time – before, during, or after other treatments – start by speaking with your doctor and accessing other trustworthy sources of medical knowledge, including respected cancer research organizations.
The American Cancer Society offers an extremely helpful clinical trials matching service, which can be reached at 1-800-303-5691, as well as a clinical trial database.The U.S. National Institute of Health webpage provides further information on clinical research trials, as well as a helpful web-based search tool at ClinicalTrials.gov.The National Cancer Institute webpage can also help you search for and learn about specific clinical trials., Some complementary treatments used alongside regular medical care can be helpful in relieving symptoms of cancer and the side effects that can result from aggressive medical treatment strategies.However, be aware that there is no scientific evidence that these treatments are effective at treating or curing cancer.


Be wary of alternative treatments that are intended to be utilized instead of standard medical treatment.
While many nontraditional healing strategies – such as acupuncture – can be used to help you feel better, understand that most unproven cancer treatments address symptoms, and are unlikely to help you fight cancer.
Some proposed treatment options may even be dangerous.
Keep your medical doctors informed of any complementary treatment options you pursue.
Speak with an integrative medicinal practitioner for more information on combining standard medical care with complementary treatments that are known to be safe and potentially helpful."

Other serious health conditions you have.
Your age and expected life span with and without treatment.
Your personal feelings regarding the need to treat your cancer with aggressive methods.
The side effects associated with each treatment option.
The realistic likelihood of each treatment option ridding your body of cancer.

, Sometimes, maintaining your quality of life may outweigh the potential benefits of treatment. Even after undergoing some treatment methods and finding that they are not working or that the side effects are impacting you negatively, you may choose not to undergo further treatment.If, for whatever reason, you are inclined not to receive treatment, you should still talk it over with your doctors.

Exercise your pelvic floor.",How to Treat Erectile Dysfunction1," Millions of men who experience erectile dysfunction (ED) each year are too embarrassed to talk about it with their doctor. ED is a very common disorder, but it is not considered to be a ""normal"" part of aging. ED is often a signal that there is an underlying problem that needs to be treated. Before attempting to overcome ED on your own, it's very important to make an appointment with your doctor and clear up any other issues that might be affecting your ability to sustain an erection.


Talk to your doctor about your vascular health.If you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or high blood sugar, it's possible that one of these conditions has damaged arteries in your heart, which can lead to ED.
Heart disease and diabetes are two serious conditions that often start with ED.If you have one of these disorders, getting treatment should help you overcome erectile dysfunction.;
, Really. Make it a priority to get outside or go to the gym and walk, run, swim, bike, or do strength training at least 4 times a week. According to a study conducted by Harvard, walking 30 minutes a day caused a 41% drop in risk for ED.Getting regular exercise aids circulation, getting your blood pumping through your entire body. When it's time to sustain an erection, better circulation is key., Larger waistlines are associated with higher rates of ED.Putting in the work to slim down can lead to huge improvements in the bedroom. Make sure you're eating a healthy diet loaded with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.


Avoid processed foods and foods made with refined sugars and flours.
Replace high-calorie drinks with water or unsweetened tea.
Eat healthy snacks like nuts, carrots and apples instead of reaching for sugar-laden power bars or fast food.

, Smoking can make ED worse, since it interferes with your circulatory system and is linked to diseases that cause ED. If you're having trouble sustaining an erection, now might be the time to give up the cigarettes for good.


If quitting doesn't seem possible right now, cut back as much as you can. If you can limit your smoking to a few cigarettes a day, that's better than smoking a pack.

, Alcohol is another substance that has a huge impact on erections. After a few drinks, many men of all ages find it much more difficult to stay hard.

, The pelvic floor helps the penis stay hard during erections by pressing on a vein that keeps blood from leaving until the erection is over.Men who exercise their pelvic floor have better results than those who rely solely on lifestyle changes to correct erectile dysfunction. So how do you strengthen this internal muscle? Kegel exercises.


To find your pelvic floor, tighten the muscles you'd need to tighten to stop your urine flow.
Tighten and release the muscle 8 times, then rest and do it 8 more times. Continue until you've done 3 or 4 sets of 8.
Do Kegels every day at least once a day.

Remove stressors from your life.,
Practice mindfulness.,
Communicate with your partner.,
Learn more about sex.",How to Treat Erectile Dysfunction2," Anxiety is one of the biggest culprits when it comes to ED. If you can find a way to destress, you'll be more likely to maintain erections. Think about the biggest sources of stress in your life right now. What can you do to give yourself a break?


If your schedule is packed from morning til night, think about what you can quit to give yourself more down time.

Turn off your electronics at least an hour before bed. You'll get better sleep, which is essential to destressing.
Spend more time outside. Getting fresh air and being around nature is a great way to calm anxiety.

, Do you find yourself getting distracted by worries instead of living in the moment during sex? Mindfulness is the act of being completely in the present, both physically and mentally. Clear your mind and focus on the sensations your body is feeling during sex.If sex has become routine and under stimulating, mix things up by adding new scents, textures, and sounds to the mix. For example, use massage oil or put on some music that gets you and your partner in the mood.

, Do you feel comfortable and accepted when it comes to your sexual performance? If you're worried about meeting your partner's too-high expectations or living up to some kind of standard, it will be harder to maintain an erection - it's called performance anxiety. If you think your partner's judgement might be hindering your ability to have satisfying sex, you need to communicate your needs and find ways to make your sexual environment more inviting.

, If you have deep-rooted anxieties or guilt related to sex, these negative emotions might be causing your ED. Learning more about sex can be a good way to feel more comfortable with your body and better understand your needs in bed.Read up on sex techniques or take a sex positive workshop as a way to open your mind to new possibilities and increase your comfort level.

Decide if you have any of the conditions that lead to low testosterone levels.",How to Tell if You Have Low Testosterone1," It is quite normal to have fewer erections as a man ages. It is not normal, however, to be unable to have or sustain an erection, and it is not normal to lose interest in sex. Lowered testosterone levels can cause sex-related symptoms, such as:Decreased sex drive (libido) and other sexually related problems:
Erectile dysfunction (ED)
A decrease in the number and quality of erections.
Decreased sperm counts and possible infertility;
, It is quite normal for a man’s testosterone level to decrease gradually with age, but you should not see many abnormal changes in your body. Lower testosterone in men can cause some bodily changes. This includes smaller testicles and swollen or tender breasts.In adolescents or young adults who have completed puberty yet, having low testosterone may cause them to appear younger than their chronological age. These adolescents/young adults may also be void of body or facial hair.
Men with lower levels may also experience hot flashes.
Men may also experience a decrease in muscle mass leading to decreased strength and endurance, along with osteopenia (softening of the bones) and osteoporosis (decreased bone density).
Men may also experience changes in blood lipids, such as cholesterol levels.

, Men who experience low testosterone levels may experience some changes to their behavior. They may feel fatigue, difficulty sleeping, or a change in sleep patterns. Mood changes can also occur, like depression, irritability, and anxiety.Men may also suffer from problems with memory, concentration, or a sudden lack of self-confidence.

, Women can have low testosterone as well. Symptoms in women most commonly occur around menopause and can complicate any treatment of menopausal symptoms. Symptoms of low testosterone in women include:Decreased sexual desire and function
Muscle weakness
Decreased vaginal lubrication
Infertility

, Testosterone levels in both men and women normally decrease with age. In men, testosterone levels decrease about 1% each year after the age of 30.Women over 40 may have half the testosterone they did in their 20s.These lower levels are normal, however, and may not point to a problem.


However, testosterone levels may drop significantly with age. Approximately 40% of men over the age of 45 have low testosterone.Watch for symptoms or discuss with your doctor if your testosterone levels are decreasing normally or if you are at risk for low levels.

, Low level production of testosterone can be due to a problem with the pituitary or hypothalamus glands. Obesity and type 2 diabetes may put you at risk for low testosterone in connection with these glands., Low testosterone levels can be caused by a variety of the conditions. Some of the common conditions include:Injury to the testicles
Alcoholism
Medication side effects
Testicular cancer or the treatments for testicular cancer
High blood pressure or cholesterol

See your physician.,
Get a blood test to check your testosterone levels.,
Decide on a treatment.,
Know the importance of testosterone.",How to Tell if You Have Low Testosterone2," People can have primary low testosterone or low testosterone due to a secondary condition. In order to tell whether you have low testosterone or a secondary condition, you need to see your doctor. Remember to tell your physician about all your medical history, and especially all your medications since low testosterone can be due to medications., Diagnosis involves primarily a blood test along with a physical exam. The test is most often done using blood drawn in the morning, when testosterone levels are highest. If the combination of symptoms you tell the doctor about and the lab results indicate low testosterone levels, you may be diagnosed with low testosterone levels.Depending on your physical exam, your symptoms, and your history, other tests for thyroid function, diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease may be performed as well.

, If you have low testosterone levels, you may be able to get testosterone therapy. Testosterone replacement therapy may be done through an applied gel on the skin or patch. You can also get an injection or tablets that dissolve in your mouth., Testosterone is responsible for the production of the primary male sexual characteristics and functions, including a deep voice, facial hair, a prominent Adam’s apple, and denser bone and muscle mass. For men, testosterone is also directly related to erectile functions, penis and testicular size, and the sex drive. Testosterone is also involved with the production of red blood cells and sperm and can decrease as a man ages.In women, testosterone is also important for muscle and bone development, sex drive, and regulation of body organs.Testosterone levels vary in different men, so it can be difficult to determine if the levels detected in one man are too low.

After a shower, you can apply the gel to the shoulders, upper arms, chest, or belly. One type of testosterone gel is applied inside the nose.Testosterone gel can be expensive.
Wash your hands after handling the gel.
Make sure the skin is dry before you have contact with women, especially pregnant women, or children. You can transfer the testosterone gel if it hasn’t dried yet.;
, Transdermal testosterone patches are another topical treatment. The patches are applied to your back, thighs, stomach, or upper arms. The spot where the patch is placed should not be oily, hairy, or prone to sweating a lot. You should place the patch in a new spot each night, and wait a week before applying it in the same spot again.You should also not place the patch where you are going to put pressure on it from something like sitting or lying down, or place it on a bone.
The patch is applied each day at the same time, usually between the hours of 8 p.m. and midnight.
Patches should not be applied to the scrotum, or skin that is irritated or has open wounds.
When removing the patch, make sure no one else comes into contact with the testosterone. Throw away the patch immediately.
The cost of the transdermal patch can be high.

, Buccal testosterone is taken orally through a lozenge-like patch. The patch is placed against your gum. The patch will dissolve in your mouth. You won’t chew or swallow it. It is normally taken twice a day, in the morning and night. This approach is an efficient way to treat low testosterone in men.Wash your hands before and after handling the patch.
Your doctor will determine the dosage that is right for you. Generally, the patches are around 30 mg.
The patches may have a bitter taste and can cause mouth irritation.

, Intramuscular testosterone (IM) injections are available. The injections can be administered every two, three, or four weeks. The testosterone is usually injected into the thigh muscle. The injections are usually given in a doctor’s office; however, self injection is often possible, depending on your physician.This approach can be the least expensive. However, you have to get an injection every few weeks and some doctors will charge for an office visit in addition to the injection.
The dosage is usually more concentrated, and varies from 100 to 400 milligrams.
This method causes a roller coaster effect. Sometimes right after injection, your levels of testosterone may be higher than normal. Between injections, your levels of testosterone may be lower than normal.

, Another option for testosterone therapy is a pellet implant. These small pellets contain testosterone. They are surgically implanted into your skin two to four times each year.Pellets have been found to provide a more consistent level of testosterone throughout each day instead of giving a roller coaster effect of testosterone levels."

Consider not undergoing any treatment.,
Make dietary changes.,
Exercise more.",How to Treat Low Testosterone2," Low testosterone is often not treated. Many men with low testosterone levels have mild symptoms that are easy to live with, or no symptoms at all. Often, unless you have severely low levels of testosterone or you are experiencing severe symptoms, your doctor will not suggest treatment.Talk to your doctor about whether you should treat your low testosterone.

, Being overweight or obese can cause low testosterone levels. Being underweight can also cause low levels. To help boost your testosterone levels, work on getting your weight to a healthy level. Start by following a healthy eating plan.Cut out processed sugars, refined carbs, and trans fats. Instead, eat whole foods, like vegetables and fruits, whole grains, low-fat dairy, and lean, quality meats.
Consider increasing your calcium and vitamin D to reduce your risk of osteoporosis., Staying physically active not only helps you lose weight, but it can help increase your body’s production of testosterone. Start with light cardio, such as walking, swimming, or riding a bicycle. Strength training can also help you increase testosterone levels.Make sure to talk to a trainer to help you with strength training before you start. Proper form ensures you build muscle and avoid injury.
Too much endurance exercise can lower your testosterone. Engage in moderate levels of testosterone.

Talk to your doctor about medication side effects.,
Consider the risks of testosterone treatment.,
Understand that TRT is controversial.",How to Treat Low Testosterone3," Symptoms such as fatigue, low energy, difficulty with erections, poor libido and decreased muscle strength can be caused by low testosterone; however, there are other disorders that can cause each of these problems. Your doctor can help you figure out what’s going on, and what testing might be helpful., Before you choose to take testosterone therapy, you should get your levels tested at least twice. Doctors generally will not rely on a single test result to decide that a male patient needs testosterone therapy. Testosterone levels vary considerably during the day, and from day to day.Get tested in the morning. The best time to have blood drawn to test for testosterone may be the morning, especially in younger men.Make an appointment with your doctor to test your levels. If your levels are close to normal each time they are tested, you probably do not need testosterone treatment.

, If your levels are close to normal each time they are tested, you probably do not need testosterone treatment. If your levels are low, but you have no symptoms, your doctor probably will not recommend treatment. Most doctors will only treat those who have low testosterone levels and significant symptoms that are likely due to low testosterone., Certain medical conditions can be the cause of low testosterone or present similar symptoms. Thyroid problems and sleep apnea can contribute to low testosterone levels. Depression or excessive alcohol consumption can also lower levels.Generally, treating the underlying condition leads to improved testosterone levels.

, Some medications can lead to low levels of testosterone. If you take medications and have low levels, talk to your doctor. Discuss whether your medication may be the cause and if there is something you can do to help.Opioid drugs, glucocorticoid, and anabolic steroids can lead to low testosterone levels., Testosterone treatment may increase the risk of certain conditions. You should always talk to your doctor before starting treatment and discuss possible risk factors. Your medical history may put you at a greater risk for certain conditions than others. When taking testosterone therapy, you are at risk for developing:Acne
Retained fluid or swollen ankles
Sore or enlarged breast tissue
Worsening of sleep apnea
Clotting in deep veins
Shrinking of the testicles
Decreased sperm production

, There is mixed evidence about whether testosterone replacement therapy can lead to heart attack or stroke, or prostate cancer.Some researchers have stated that TRT has no benefits at all."

Educate yourself.,
Choose an appropriate time and place.,
Prepare your opening.,
Be open and honest about your feelings.,
Listen to your partner.",How to Tell Your Partner You Have Erectile Dysfunction1," There are many misconceptions about impotence. You need to educate both you and your partner on the causes of ED to clear up these myths. Some common myths about ED include:

ED is just part of aging. This is not true. It is not just older men who get ED. Some young men may get ED due to another health problem or a psychological issue.

Drinking will make sex easier. Drinking before having sex may cause more problems because drinking can worsen ED.You can't talk to your doctor about ED. Also not true. ED is a medical condition and you should talk to your doctor about it.

There is no cure for ED. In reality, almost all cases of ED are treatable.;
, You are probably nervous about revealing to your partner that you have erectile dysfunction. Have a plan to determine the best time and place to engage in a heart-to-heart conversation with your partner.


Make sure you choose a place where you and your partner will be most comfortable. Perhaps the bedroom would not be the best place to talk to avoid associating the bedroom with such a sensitive topic.

, Sometimes it’s hard to find the right words when addressing a sensitive topic. Consider practicing what you will say during the opening of your conversation. It might be easiest to begin by telling your partner that you are uncomfortable talking about your erectile dysfunction.For example, you might say, “I’m really embarrassed to talk about this, but I want to talk about the problem I’ve been having when we’re having sex.”

, You partner needs to know how you’re feeling about having erectile dysfunction. Explain how your feelings impact you emotionally and mentally. This will go a long way in helping your partner get a better understanding of what you are going through and how to support you as well.For example, you might say, “I feel like our entire relationship has changed because of ED. Who wants to be with a man that struggles with keeping things going in bed. When I start thinking like this, I just want to be left alone.”

, Try to understand that your partner may have a lot of questions and concerns about what you have shared. Be open to hearing your partner out.


You might find the conversation uncomfortable and even a bit embarrassing. Your partner might express feelings of disbelief or hopelessness. This is normal, however, remind yourself that you’ve now tackled the hardest part, and you should be proud of yourself.

Avoid blaming your partner.,
Reassure your partner.",How to Tell Your Partner You Have Erectile Dysfunction2," You are probably experiencing a range of emotions, including blaming yourself. Male sexual arousal is a complex process that involves the brain, hormones, emotions, muscles and blood vessels, along with many different physical and psychological issues. It is pointless and futile to blame yourself., Sometimes it’s easier to lash out and blame others when dealing with life challenges. However, this is counterproductive and only result in creating resentment and hurt feelings.


For example, avoid making blame statements like “you need to wear sexier lingerie,” or ""If you weren’t stressing me all of the time, I wouldn’t have this problem.”

, Your significant other may also be struggling with his or her own guilt. They might be wondering if they are somehow responsible for creating or exacerbating your impotence.


Try to be supportive and understanding of your partner’s feelings. Your partner may be worrying that you no longer find her or him attractive.Try saying something like, “I think you are beautiful and I am still attracted to you. This has nothing to do with the way I feel about you.”
For example, you might find your partner saying things like “I guess you don’t find me as attractive as you used to when I younger,” or “maybe I’ve just gained too much weight.” You can respond by making a reassuring statement such as, “That’s not true. You are as beautiful as you’ve always been. My impotence is not about you at all.”

Explore drug treatments.,
Seek counseling.,
Consider using vacuum devices.,
Discuss surgery as a last resort.",How to Tell Your Partner You Have Erectile Dysfunction3," In recent years, the medical community has made much advancement in treating erectile dysfunction through the use of medications. Medications can be taken orally, injected, and inserted into the tip of the penis.


Talk to your partner about drug treatment options. You can try different options together and decide which choice is best for you based on your performance, your partner's experience, and any side effects.
Some common oral ED medications include Viagra, Cialis, Stendra and Levitra.A doctor may prescribe a drug called alprostadil when pill treatment is deemed unsafe or ineffective. Alprostadil is injected into the side of the penis with a fine needle and it produces an erection that lasts for about 20 to 40 minutes., Stress can cause erectile dysfunction. Talk with a counselor about the various stressors in your life to help you learn how to cope and to develop strategies in handling it. This can help reduce sexual anxiety and improve your sexual function.Including your partner in your sex therapy sessions may also help.Your partner can offer a different perspective on your relationship and yourself that might help you to overcome ED.

, Vacuum devices, also known as penis pumps, may help to improve the flow of blood to the penis. The device goes over your penis and it uses suction to pull more blood into your penis, which causes an erection. Then, you place a band around the base of your penis to keep the blood in your penis and maintain the erection during intercourse.Your doctor can recommend or prescribe a good penis pump if you want to try this option.

, If all other options for treating erectile dysfunction have failed, you and your partner might want to talk with your doctor about surgical options. The two most common surgeries are placing an implant into the penis or vascular reconstruction surgery, which is rarely recommended.Penile implants consist of inflatable or semi-rigid rods that are placed in the sides of your penis. These rods will make it possible for you to have an erection and many men who have this procedure are satisfied with the results."

Try buccal testosterone.,
Take transdermal testosterone gel.,
Consider transdermal testosterone patch.,
Talk to your doctor before starting any testosterone replacement therapy.",How to Take Testosterone1," Buccal testosterone is taken orally through a lozenge. The lozenge dissolves in your mouth. It is normally taken twice a day, in the morning and night. This approach is an efficient way to dose testosterone in men.However, the lozenges have a bitter taste and can cause mouth irritation.;
, Transdermal testosterone gel is a commonly used approach. It is a gel that is applied on the body which mimics a dose that would normally occur. The gel is applied to the shoulders, upper arms, chest, or belly. Make certain you wash your hands after application. The gel is applied once a day at the same time, usually in the morning by about eight a.m.The cost of the gel can be high.
You have to make certain the areas are dry before coming into contact with women (especially pregnant women) or children. There is a risk of transferring the testosterone if the gel isn’t dry.

, The transdermal testosterone patch is another skin-dosing approach, which mimics a dose that would normally occur. Some of the patches may be applied onto the scrotum, though they may be placed on the arms or back as well. The patch is applied once a day at the same time, usually in the morning by about eight a.m.When you remove the patch, make certain no one else is exposed to the testosterone. Dispose of the patch immediately.
The cost of the transdermal patch is high as well.

, Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) is only done under the care of a physician. No matter which method you use, it is important to get regularly checked to make certain enough testosterone is entering your blood to be effective.Before beginning testosterone therapy, your doctor must perform a digital rectal exam and PSA blood test should be measured. If these are abnormal (suggesting an enlarged prostate), then therapy should not be started and further testing should be done.
Three months after starting testosterone, the same tests should be performed. If there is concern for enlarged prostate or prostate nodules at that time, then testosterone should be stopped.
The Endocrine Society generally recommends TRT if the tested levels of testosterone are lower than 300 ng/dL and there are symptoms of low testosterone.Testosterone pills are available, but are not useful, as taking plain testosterone by mouth has no effect because the liver metabolizes it too rapidly. Modified forms of testosterone pills were made that prevented the testosterone from being metabolized in the liver, but it was shown that these forms can cause damage to the liver."

Do not take testosterone unless it is prescribed by a physician.,
Choose intramuscular testosterone.,
Gather the materials.,
Draw up the prescribed amount of testosterone.,
Clean the area.,
Administer the medicine.,
Clean up the materials.",How to Take Testosterone2," Testosterone must be prescribed to you by a licensed physician. This hormone is often abused and can be purchased on the black market, which is extremely dangerous. There is no way to verify the product you receive illegally is safe for you to take, or verify the quality, sterility, and purity of the product., Intramuscular testosterone (IM) is an intramuscular injection. The dose usually varies from 200 to 400 milligrams. It can be given every two, three, or four weeks, usually injected into the thigh muscle. The testosterone seeps out of the injection site into the body. The injections may be given in an office, though self injection is often possible, depending on your physician. This approach usually is the least expensive, though you have to get a shot every few weeks.This method does not mimic a dose that would normally occur in the body. There may be times, like right after injection, when the levels of testosterone are higher than normal, and times between injections when the levels of testosterone are lower than normal. This is called a roller coaster effect.

, Find a clear, comfortable place to set up where you can place everything you need. Remove the testosterone from the refrigerator and allow the testosterone to come to room temperature.Make sure you know what dosage you need to administer for yourself.
Wash your hands before beginning.

, Insert the needle straight down through the center of the rubber stopper of the vial. Push the plunger of the syringe down, pushing the air from the syringe into the vial. Keep the needle in the vial and turn the vial upside down. Make certain the liquid in the vial is covering the tip of the needle. Keep the vial upside down and slowly pull back on the plunger to fill the syringe with the medication to the dose that matches the dose your doctor ordered.Do not put the needle through the rubber stopper more than once.
While keeping the needle in the vial, check for air bubbles. If there are any air bubbles, gently tap the syringe with your fingers until the air bubbles rise to the top of the syringe. Slowly push the plunger up to force the air bubbles out of the syringe without removing the needle from the bottle.

, Remove the syringe needle from the vial. Make sure you do not let the needle touch anything. Use an alcohol wipe to clean the injection area.The injection site is generally the outer middle third of your thigh, but follow your physician’s instructions.

, Form a ""V"" with your first and second fingers. Place the heel of your hand near your hip and gently spread the skin on the outer middle third of your thigh. The injection site will be between the knuckles of the V formed by your fingers. Use a quick, firm, and single motion to insert the needle. If there is no blood, gently, slowly, and firmly push the plunger to inject the testosterone.Pull back on the plunger just a bit to check that there is no blood. If you see any blood in the syringe, do not inject.

, Remove the syringe needle and clean the area with the alcohol swab once again. Dispose of used needles in an appropriate sharps or biohazard waste container.Apply pressure if needed to stop any bleeding.

Learn the importance of testosterone.,
Understand why low testosterone levels occur.,
Know the symptoms of low testosterone.,
Diagnose testosterone levels.,
Know the side effects of TRT.,
Understand when not to take testosterone.",How to Take Testosterone3," Testosterone is responsible for the production of male sexual characteristics and functions, including a deep voice, facial hair, and denser bone and muscle mass. It is directly related to erectile functions, penis and testicular size, and the sex drive. Testosterone is also involved with the production of red blood cells and sperm.Normal levels of testosterone help to prevent high blood pressure and heart attacks.

, Low levels of testosterone may represent normal male aging; however, low levels of testosterone are also associated with a number of different health issues in men, as well as an increased risk of death. Testosterone levels vary in different men, so it can be difficult to determine if the levels detected in one man are too low or if they represent a normal decrease with age.It is quite normal for a man’s testosterone level to decrease gradually with age. It is also quite normal to have fewer erections as a man ages.
It is not normal, however, to be unable to have or sustain an erection, and it is not normal to lose interest in sex. This can be a symptom of many other, more common cases as well, including diabetes and depression.

, Though low testosterone is normal, levels that are too low can lead to many health problems. Symptoms of low levels of testosterone in men include:Problems with sexual function. This can include erectile dysfunction, decreased desire for sexual activity, and a decrease in the number and quality of erections.
Smaller testes
Emotional problems, such as depression, irritability, anxiety, problems with memory or concentration
Sleep disruption
Increased fatigue or a general overall lack of energy
Body changes, such as increased belly fat, decreased muscle mass, decreased strength and endurance, decreased cholesterol levels, and osteopenia (softening of the bones) and osteoporosis (decreased bone density)
Swollen or tender breasts
Loss of body hair
Hot flashes
Women can have low testosterone as well. Symptoms of low testosterone in women include decreased sexual desire and function, muscle weakness, decreased vaginal lubrication, and infertility., To diagnose low testosterone levels, your physician will perform a physical exam and take a blood sample to test for testosterone levels. Depending on your physical exam, your symptoms, and your history, other tests may be performed as well. These tests check for thyroid function, diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease.


If you are experiencing any of the symptoms, call your physician to have your testosterone levels tested.

, For those individuals who do choose TRT, you should know about potential side effects. Because of these potentially serious side effects, your physician will be most likely asking you to come in frequently for checkups. This may be every three to six months. You should also keep track of any changes in your body and report them immediately to your physician. The side effects include:Increased risk of heart attacks and heart disease
Increased risk of strokes and blood clots
Increased risk of prostate cancer
Sleep apnea
Polycythemia, or increased levels of red blood cells — this causes the blood to get thicker and increases the risk of blood clots.
Enlargement of male breasts
Acne and oily skin
Changes in hair patterns
Decrease in the size of testicles
Changes in cholesterol and blood lipid levels

, Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) is not for every man. There are circumstances in which it is not recommended. For example, TRT is not recommended for men with sleep apnea, a high red blood cell count, congestive heart failure, or prostate conditions, such as benign prostatic hypertrophy, prostate cancer, or breast cancer."

If time is an issue, you can look into surgical options.",How to Regrow Foreskin," There are many reasons why a man would choose to restore his foreskin.


Some men prefer the look of the intact penis and will regrow their foreskin for aesthetic reasons, while others resent not having a choice as with infant circumcision.
However the majority of men will regrow their foreskin to seek the great increase in sensitivity reported by restored men.
Whatever the reason, a man should ask himself if he is ready to undertake a project that will take years to complete and permanently affect the most private area of his body.;
, Currently, the most effective way to regrow your foreskin is through tissue expansion.


This works by pulling the skin of the penile shaft over the glans and applying tension (either manually or using a device) until new skin cells are produced and the tissue on the skin of the penis expands.
Once the foreskin has expanded enough to cover the glans, the tissue beneath becomes less calloused and some of the hidden nerve endings are restored, resulting in increased sensitivity.

, There are many options for restoring the foreskin, it's just a matter of deciding which works best for you and fits into your lifestyle. For instance, a man who uses a public shower or locker room may prefer a device that can be donned and removed quickly and inconspicuously. A college student with roommates and not much money may prefer manual tugging. Therefore, it is very important to do your research and carefully consider each of the following factors (among others) before making a decision.



Cost: Although some methods cost nothing (manual tugging) others require expensive ($40 to $300) equipment.

Level of commitment: How much time you're willing to invest in regrowing your foreskin will affect which method you should use.

Type of activity throughout restoration time (work, exercise, etc.): Many restoration devices require a weight to be worn on the penis for hours at a time, which could be impractical if you live an active lifestyle.

The amount of ""extra"" skin (i.e. skin folds) you currently have: Some tugging devices (such as the CAT II, DTR or TLC-X) require a certain amount of loose skin before they can be used. Therefore if you're cut very tightly, your options may be more limited, at least at first.

Whether you have more shaft or mucosal skin: Shaft skin is from the circ scar line to the base of the penis and is called ""outer"" skin. Mucosal skin goes from the corona of the glans to the scar. Since this skin will fold against the glans and therefore be ""inside"" the prepuce, it's referred to as ""inner"" skin.

, Manual tugging involves using your hands to gently but firmly stretch skin. It is usually done for 15 minutes intervals, three or four times a day.


Manual tugging is the cheapest and easiest method of regrowing your foreskin, but it requires a lot of commitment as it can take a long time before any obvious results are achieved.

, You will also need to ensure that you have plenty of uninterrupted time to yourself during the day when you can perform the manual tugging, as it can be quite conspicuous.


Your morning shower is a good time to practice tugging, as the water helps to prevent the skin from becoming irritated.
You can also tug while watching TV (alone) or while taking a bathroom break (if you use a stall).

, A good tugging technique for beginners involves making an ""ok"" symbol using the index finger and thumb on both hands.


Use one hand to encircle the shaft of your penis near the scrotum and the other to encircle the shaft near the glans.
Then gently begin pulling the skin in opposite directions. Hold the stretch for 5 to 30 seconds, then release for several seconds before repeating.
This tugging method is very effective as it creates tension around the full circumference of the shaft., Reports vary on how long you need to tug for per day in order to get the best results. Some men claim it's necessary to tug for a minimum of four hours a day, while others report success with tugging for only one hour a day.


The best thing to do is start out slow, until you get used to tugging process. This will help to prevent the skin on your penis from becoming sore or irritated.
Try tugging for 15 minute intervals, 4 to 8 times per day. Over time, you can increase the length of time you tug for and the amount of tension you apply - if you feel it's necessary., There are number of tugging devices available which work by simultaneously pulling and pushing the skin on the shaft for both inner and outer skin growth. Some of the most popular devices include:



TLC tugger: With the TLC tugger, a silicone plug is placed against the glans, then the shaft skin is pulled up over the plug and held in place with a soft rubber cap. You can then attach one end of an elastic strap to the TLC and the other end around the knee or leg, in order to apply pulling tension. Weights can also be used.

TLC-X device: Short for ""TapeLess Conical eXtensible,"" this device is effective as it can be extended as you gain skin, making it a more long-lasting piece of equipment. Weights or straps can also be used to increase tension. It's available online for about $80.

CATIIQ device: CATIIQ is short for ""Constant Applied Tension II Quick."" The benefit of this device is that it can be attached and detached from the penis quickly and easily. It's available online and on eBay for around $80.

DTR device: DTR is short for ""Dual Tension Restorer."" It's available online for about $90.

MySkinClamp: Made from medical-grade stainless steel, this device functions similarly to the CATIIQ and DTR.

Foreballs: These require some foreskin, which is drawn over one of the balls and taped in place.

Penile Uncircumcising Device: Or PUD, is placed against the glans, the skin is drawn over the PUD and taped in place. Weight of the PUD applies tension.

, T-tape is medical tape formed into a ""T"" shape (from a side view) which is wrapped around the penis and drawn forward over the glans. Instructions on how to make t-tape from common medical tape and how to apply it are available at several restoration forums.


Comfortable and effective, this method suits many restorers and can be worn 24 hours or more, including during sleep.
Drawbacks include the time it takes to apply and remove the tape, discomfort when removing and the lack of spontaneity when amorous.

, O-Rings are simple rubber gaskets available at most hardware stores. The major benefit of O-Rings is that they can speed up the dekeratinization of the glans, thus increasing sensitivity.


With O-Rings, shaft skin is drawn over the glans and fed through the ring. The skin then naturally pulls back, which creates tension as the ring is drawn back against the glans.
This method requires more loose skin than many beginning restorers have, so it is a good option once you have already developed a certain amount of loose skin.

, Alternatively, instead of buying expensive devices, you can make your own restoration device using simple household items. The most common of these include pill tubes or film canisters, deep sockets and trombone mouthpieces.



Pill tubes and film canister: By cutting the bottom from a cylinder 35mm film canister or pill tube, you can draw shaft skin over the plastic and tape it in place. By attaching a wire, it's possible to apply tension with an elastic band around the knee or leg. Stuffing the cylinder with cotton and capping it can apply 'inner' tension as well.

Deep socket: A stainless steel deep socket provides a convenient and effective weight to stretch the foreskin. Taped on with waterproof tape, it weighs 12 ounces and has an opening through which to urinate.

Trombone mouthpiece: Used in the same manner as Foreballs and PUD, usually with medical tape to hold skin in place. Monette TT5 trombone mouthpiece are prefered, as they are heavier, but Bach 5G would also work

, The process of regrowing your foreskin - whether manually or using a device - takes some getting used to and requires lots of commitment.


Though some men report initial gains, don't expect to see immediate results. Remember, the race goes not to the swift nor the strong but to he who endures to the end!
If you really feel that a particular tugging method isn't working for you, try switching things up. You might find that a different manual tugging technique or a new device is more effective for your body.

, Tugging should not be painful or cause injuries of any kind, as long as it's done correctly.


Listen to your body and stop if you notice any redness, rawness or pain.
If you are experiencing pain, you are either tugging to much or tugging for too long and you need to be more gentle or cut back.

, While it sounds like a strange idea, many men who don't start one end up regretting not having ""before"" pictures.


Because the process is so long, you won't notice gradual changes over months of work. But pulling up an image from last year can really surprise you.
Get extreme close ups (member should fill the frame) from the front and each side. Use the same location and lighting conditions every time.
Take one set of pictures a month and remember to date the photos. Store them on a computer only you have access to or password-protect their location.

, If tugging methods seem like they will take too long or require too much of a commitment, or you are more concerned with the appearance of your penis, you could consider surgical restoration.


Surgical foreskin restoration works by grafting skin from another area of the body (usually the scrotum - which has similar muscle tissue) onto the end of the shaft.
Surgical restoration is much faster than regrowing the foreskin, however it is very costly and many men have reported dissatisfaction with the surgery.
Surgical restoration is mainly for men who want to restore their foreskin for aesthetic reasons, as unfortunately this option cannot restore sensitivity."

Try to limit your consumption of alcohol and uncontrolled substances so your male breasts do not become larger over time., Herbal products made of plant oils, such as tea tree or lavender, have been associated with the development of gynecomastia. This could be due to the weak estrogenic activity in herbal products. In other words, these plants contain substances that act like estrogen, one of the main female sex hormones.Plant estrogens can be found in soy beans, certain whole grains like flaxseed, rye, and millet, and some legumes (peas, beans, and lentils).Do not use shampoos, soaps, or lotions that contain estrogenic plant oils. You should also avoid applying these oils in their pure form on your upper body area.

, Many food animals are given hormones to promote growth or milk production. There is some evidence that eating hormone-enhanced meat or dairy products can affect how our bodies produce hormones.Eating organic meat and dairy products from animals that have not been given hormones may help you prevent or reduce symptoms of gynecomastia., Certain medications have been shown to cause gynecomastia or make this condition worse. You should avoid the following medications or speak to your doctor if you are already on these medications:Anti-anxiety medications, such as diazepam (Valium), as well as tricyclic antidepressants.

Your doctor can help you decide if diet and exercise are the best solution for reducing your breasts.
Gynecomastia is often caused by hormonal imbalance, where your body is producing less testosterone and more estrogen. This can then lead to enlarged breasts. You can experience enlarged breasts during puberty and as an adult, with men commonly developing gynecomastia between the ages of 50 and 80. Men with gynecomastia may have breasts that feel tender, sensitive, and appear swollen.

, You can do chest presses using dumbbells at home or at the gym. Chest presses will help to work out your chest muscles, tightening them and reducing the saggy appearance of your breast area.Lay down on a flat or slanted exercise bench with your back against the bench. Hold a dumbbell in each hand.
You can use ten to fifteen pound (4.5 to 6.8 kilogram) dumbbells if you do not use free weights often. Otherwise, use dumbbells that feel heavy, but not impossible to pick up.
Breath in and bend your elbows until your upper arms are parallel to your chest. Then, exhale as you push up slowly holding the dumbbells until your arms are straight. Make sure there is a little bend at your elbows so you do not lock out your arms.
Hold the position for two seconds and then inhale as you return to the starting position, with your upper arms parallel to your chest.
Repeat this for three sets of 10 reps three to four times a week. You may integrate chest presses into a total body workout routine that you do several times a week. Keep in mind it is more effective to do a total body workout to tighten up your muscles rather than target one muscle group, such as your chest muscles.

, You can start with normal push ups, if you are new to push ups, and then transition into more difficult variations, such as decline push ups.To do normal push ups, place your hands a little wider than your shoulders on an exercise mat. Then, stretch your legs behind you so they are hip width apart. Make sure you are on the balls of your toes, with your legs straight and strong. Flatten your lower back so your hips are in line with your shoulders.
Inhale as you hold the starting position and exhale as you slowly bend your arms and lower yourself towards the floor. Only drop down low enough for your chin to almost graze the floor and then inhale as you push yourself back up. Repeat this for three sets of 10 reps, three to four times a week.
To do a variation, like decline push ups, place your feet on an exercise bench or the second step on a set of stairs. Then, place your arms wider than shoulder width on the floor so your upper body is on a decline. Do three sets of 10 reps of decline push ups, three to four times a week.

, Bench presses are a more advanced exercise you can do at the gym or at home using a bench press bar. This exercise is great for strengthen your chest muscles and building your arm strength.Start by determining your hand positioning on the bench press bar. Lie down on the bench and unrack the bar, with no weight on it. Lower the bar slowly to your chest and note where your forearms are. Your forearms should be as close to vertical as possible as you lower the bar. Your grip should be strong and comfortable on the bar as you raise and lower it.
You may want to start with a lower amount of weight on the bar and then work your way up. Make sure your feet are firmly planted on the floor and your knees are bent at an 80 degree angle.
Exhale as you unrack the bar and tighten up your abdominal muscles. Inhale as you lower the bar all the way down towards your sternum until it hovers just above the center of your chest. Let the bar lightly touch your chest, and avoid letting the bar bounce or hit your chest. Then, exhale as you raise the bar back to the starting position.
Start with four to eight reps and then increase the amount of reps you do over time. You may integrate bench presses into an overall workout routine to strengthen your pectoral muscles.

, The rowing machine is a fun way to build cardiovascular strength and work out your back, abs, shoulders, and legs. While the pectorals are not involved in the rowing motion, rowing exercises can help burn calories for all-over fat reduction. Rowing is also a great way to balance out other exercises that focus on your chest muscles.You can find seated rowing machines at your local gym or buy one for home use online. Try to spend at least 30 minutes on the rowing machine and maintain a steady pace as you row. You should be working hard enough on the rowing machine to break a sweat, as this will indicate you are really working your heart and lungs.

, It is often more effective to work out your entire body, rather than try to target one particular area or muscle group. You can create an interval training program where the focus is on your chest muscles as well as your overall health. Interval training involves doing a series of short, intense exercises as well as exercises that are less intense and take longer to perform. This type of training can be great for weight loss and fat burn.You may create an interval training program where you do quick, intense exercises like decline push ups and chest presses, followed by cardio on the rowing machine and bench presses exercises.
You should try to also include exercises for your legs and core in your interval training program so it is well balanced. Ask a trainer at your local gym for advice or look up existing interval training programs online that include upper body exercises.

Talk to your doctor about your surgical options.,
Discuss the procedure with the surgeon.,
Be aware of the risks associated with the procedure.",How to Reduce Male Breast Size3," If you have tried exercise and dietary changes to no avail, or if you have a medical issue that is causing your gynecomastia, you may consider breast reduction surgery. You should set up a consultation with a plastic surgeon about male breast reduction surgery to ensure it is right for your condition.You can ask your GP for a referral to a plastic surgeon who specializes in breast reduction surgery for men. You may want to set up consultations with several surgeons to find one that is right for you.
Though breast reduction surgery is an effective way to reduce your breasts, you will need to also maintain a healthy weight, balance your hormonal levels, and avoid certain drugs to reduce the chances of developing gynecomastia again.

, Before you commit to breast reduction surgery, you should sit down with the surgeon and have her outline the procedure from start to finish.You will be put under general anaesthetic during the procedure, which should take around 90 minutes. Fatty tissue will be removed through an incision around your nipple. The surgeon may also make cuts down your chest to move excess tissue and then reposition your nipples.
You will need to recover overnight in the hospital and allow yourself a few days off to rest. You will also need to avoid any strenuous activity up to six weeks after the operation. You will have to wear an elastic garment after the operation to assist with healing and recovery.

, Though breast reduction surgery is often very effective, the surgery can leave red and lumpy scars in the area. They may appear for several months and then fade gradually over time.You are also at risk of losing sensation in your nipples and having uneven nipples as a result of the surgery.

Cope with breast cancer.",How to Recognize Male Breast Cancer," Doctors do not know what causes male breast cancer, but are aware that certain factors can increase your risk of developing the disease. Being aware of your potential risk can prompt you to check yourself and see your doctor regularly.The following factors can increase your risk of male breast cancer:


Age — most men who have breast cancer develop it after age 60
Exposure to estrogen — either through medication as a part of a sex-change procedure or hormone therapy for prostate cancer
Family history — if you have one or more close family members who developed breast cancer, you are more likely to get the disease
Klinefelter’s syndrome, which causes your body to produce less male hormones and more female hormones
Liver disease, such as cirrhosis, which increases female hormones in your system
Obesity
Alcoholism
Exposure to radiation on your chest area
Certain testicle diseases or types of surgery on your testicles
Gynecomastia, or abnormal enlargement of both male breasts
BRCA2 gene mutation;
, Men have small amounts of breast tissue and any changes should be evaluated. Many men don’t think about the health of their breasts, but there are several signs and symptoms of male breast cancer to watch for. You may notice these during routine activities such as showering or changing your clothes. The following may be signs of male breast cancer:Thickening of your breast tissue
Developing a painless lump in your breast
Changing texture of the skin on your breast including dimpling, puckering, redness or scaling
Inverting of your nipple
Having clear or bloody discharge from your nipple
Experiencing pain in your breast
Developing sores on your nipple or areola
Having enlarged lymph nodes under your arm

, You may notice some irregularities develop on your chest or breast(s) as a result of male breast cancer. Keeping an eye on your breasts and skin can alert you to perform a breast self exam and see your doctor.


Check your chest and breast skin regularly so that you can more easily detect changes to them. Stand in front of a mirror and look at your chest area once a week or month, especially if you know you are at risk for the disease. Compare each breast and notice any differences in the texture or shape. If you do notice any changes, perform a breast self-exam to see if you can detect any further symptoms through touch.
See your doctor if you notice any possible symptoms of male breast cancer. The sooner you detect and get treatment for possible male breast cancer, the better your chances of curing the disease., In addition to examining your chest skin, pay attention to any pain you feel in your breasts. You should also watch for any clear or bloody discharge coming from your breasts. Both of these symptoms can indicate male breast cancer, especially if you have them over a longer period of time.Check for any moist spots on your shirts, which can be a sign of discharge. In addition, simply examining your breasts on a regular basis may help you detect discharge.
Notice if you have any pain when wearing clothing, touching your skin, or during activities such as exercise.

, If you suspect any changes to your breasts, make sure to talk to your significant about your concerns. Your significant other may recognize symptoms or differences in your breasts that you did not see. They can help you perform a breast self-exam to detect further changes and provide much needed support while you get medical attention.Be open and honest with your partner about your concerns and what symptoms you’ve detected. Ask your partner about any changes they have noticed. For example, you could say, “I’ve found this scaly patch of skin on my nipple and sometimes there’s a clear liquid that comes out of it. Have you noticed this as well? Would you mind helping me take a closer look at it?”

, If both of your breasts become larger, this condition is known as gynecomastia. Generally, this is not breast cancer, even though your breasts can become quite large. Gynecomastia is sometimes caused by medications, heavy alcohol consumption, marijuana use, and weight gain, though the cause is often unknown in many cases. Although having gynecomastia doesn't mean you have breast cancer, there is some evidence that suggests the condition may increase your risk of developing male breast cancer.If you are concerned about gynecomastia, schedule an appointment with your doctor., Even though it’s rare in men, it’s important to check for breast cancer if you are at high risk or have symptoms. Don’t allow yourself to feel embarrassed or emasculated by taking care of your health, including performing a breast self-exam on yourself. Breast cancer affects both sexes and neither developing the disease nor giving yourself an exam bear any reflection of your masculinity.

, The most optimal time to perform a breast self-exam is after a warm shower or bath. The warmth smoothes out your skin and makes it easier to perform the exam.Consider doing a preliminary check of your breast tissue while you’re in the shower. You can examine and feel your breasts while you’re showering or bathing.

, A breast self-exam requires feeling your breast tissues in a thorough and methodical manner. Check each breast individually by using the opposite hand to the breast you want to examine. Work from the outside of your breast by your armpit and feel around the entire breast to ensure you’ve checked every surface of the tissue.Lie down flat on your bed, the floor, or a table so that your breast tissue is evenly spread out across your chest.
Lay your fingers flat on the breast you’re examining. Then firmly press the tissue in small, clockwise circles. Start at the outermost top edge of your breast and spiral the circles in towards your nipple. Use this technique for your entire breast and then repeat the process on the other side. Make sure you are checking your armpits as well.
Feel for lumps and bumps during the exam and note where you find them. This can help your doctor more quickly locate them during any subsequent exams. In addition, make sure to closely look at your breast skin during the examination, which can help you identify any other changes such as puckering, dimpling, or scaly skin.

, Once you’ve thoroughly felt each of your breasts for changes, you should also check your nipples. Look at the skin, feel it with your fingers, and gently squeeze them to see if there is any discharge., If you find any signs or symptoms of male breast cancer and/ or are at risk for it, visit your doctor as soon as you are able. Early detection and diagnosis can significantly increase your chances of successful treatment and survival.Make sure your doctor’s office knows why you are scheduling the exam so that your doctor can provide prompt attention to your symptoms or concerns.
Tell your doctor about any symptoms of male breast cancer that you have including changes to your breast appearance and the way it feels. Alert the doctor to any lumps or irregularities you felt during a breast self-exam.
Since there are other reasons for breast changes in men, giving a thorough and honest history is important and should include any medications, herbs, or supplements that you are taking or receiving from other professionals. Not providing proper information could hinder your doctor’s ability to diagnose cancer or another condition.

, If your doctor suspects breast cancer, he or she will likely perform a clinical breast exam and order further testing. Tests including biopsies and imaging tests can better help your doctor diagnose breast cancer, determine the extent of the disease, and develop the best treatment plan for you.Allow your doctor to examine your breasts and perform clinical breast exam. Like a self-exam, a clinical breast exam will include your doctor using his or her fingertips to feel for lumps or other changes in your breasts and surrounding tissues. The exam can also tell your doctor things such as the size of any lumps, the way they feel, and their proximity to your skin and muscles. Make sure to let the doctor know if you experience any pain during the exam.
Get imaging tests including mammograms, ultrasounds, CT scans, and MRIs if your doctor prescribes them. These tests can help your doctor more closely look at tissue irregularities and determine the extent of any cancer you may have.
Have a biopsy to remove lumps or suspect breast tissue. Biopsies, where fine needle is inserted into the tissue to remove tissue for laboratory analysis, can also help determine if you have breast cancer and, if so, what type of cancer it is.

, If testing discovers that you have cancer, your doctor will develop a treatment based on severity of your condition. There are different treatment options for male breast cancer, all of which can successfully treat and cure the disease. Remember that early detection and diagnosis are key to treatment.Talk to your doctor about your treatment options and any concerns you may have. Ask questions about the diagnosis and nature of your breast cancer as well as the best ways to treat your specific case.
Consider surgery such as a mastectomy to remove any tumors and surrounding tissue. In addition, you may require surgical removal of one lymph node to help determine if your breast cancer has spread.
Undergo radiation therapy, which uses high-energy beams from sources like X-rays to eliminate breast cancer cells In many cases, radiation is combined with mastectomy to most effectively kill and remove breast cancer cells.
Receive chemotherapy drugs by pill or intravenously to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy can be used in conjunction with surgery and may be a good option for men with advanced cases of breast cancer.
Consider hormone therapy if your breast cancer is hormone-sensitive. This usually includes taking the medication tamoxifen, which many women with breast cancer also take. Be aware, though, that other hormone therapies used on female breast cancer patients do not work for men.
Try targeted drug therapy, which attacks defects in cancer cells. Drugs such as Herceptin and Avastin may slow or even stop the growth of cancer cells; however, they can come with the side effect of heart damage.Ask your doctor about participating in clinical trial for male breast cancer. This option may provide you a new and different treatment method that can kill your breast cancer.

, If you receive a diagnosis of male breast cancer, it may shock and upset you. Using different methods to cope with the disease can help you better deal with any stress or challenges that may arise because of the disease. You might want to try:


Talking with a trusted person or medical professional about your diagnosis
Praying or meditation to help calm yourself
Exercising, which can help you feel better physically and mentally
Undertaking creative activities such as music, art, and dance, all of which can help you distress and feel better
Joining a local or national male breast cancer support group

"
Lose weight if you are overweight.,
Partake in short-term high-intensity exercise.,
Get good quality sleep on a regular basis.,
Don't avoid natural fats.,
Reduce stress levels.,
Consume enough zinc.,
Get plenty of vitamin D. Vitamin D is a very important nutrient when it comes to testosterone production.,
Consider supplementing with D-aspartic acid (DAA).,
Try diet and exercise changes as your health permits.,
Supplement nutrients when levels are low.,
Use natural remedies after consulting with your doctor.,
Consider other options with extreme caution.",How to Raise Testosterone Levels Naturally (Teen Boys)," Some research points to a correlation between being overweight (obesity in particular) and low levels of testosterone in both men and teenage boys.It's been noted in significantly overweight males that losing weight can stimulate a natural increase in testosterone production.


For teenage boys, limiting dietary processed sugar (such as refined sucrose and high fructose corn syrup) is critical in order to maintain a healthy weight. Limit consumption of soda pop, doughnuts, cakes, cookies, ice cream and candies to special occasions and infrequent treats.
On the other hand, you should eat lots of fresh produce (fruits and veggies), whole grains, fish and low-fat dairy products. Swap out sugary beverages for purified water and low-fat milk.
Make healthy substitutions for your favorite foods. Make mac-and-cheese with whole-wheat pasta and stir in some squash puree. Bake pizza on whole-grain crust with lots of fresh veggies and a little low-fat cheese. Make chili and burgers with ground turkey or chicken instead of ground beef.
Cardiovascular exercise is the other important component of weight loss. Walking each night for 30-45 minutes is enough to kick start significant weight loss when combined with eating right. Cycling and swimming are other excellent cardiovascular exercises.;
, Casual walking is great for weight loss, but high-intensity exercise (such as playing soccer, swimming or lifting weights) can directly stimulate testosterone production. However, the key is how long you spend doing the exercise as well as your intensity levels. Short bouts of high-intensity exercise (weightlifting in particular) has a proven positive effect on increasing testosterone levels and preventing its depletion in teenage and older males.Thus, keep your workouts relatively short (no more than 30 minutes) and try to go full out in as safe a manner as possible. Working out for longer periods (an hour or more) at less intense levels can sometimes reduce testosterone levels in men / boys.


As a general rule, the more muscle mass you stimulate with exercise, the more testosterone you'll produce. Leg presses and squats (with weights) are especially effective at triggering testosterone production because of the large muscle groups that are stimulated.
Other good weightlifting exercises for stimulating testosterone production are bench presses and deadlifts.
The skeleton and soft tissues of teenage boys are still growing, so intense weightlifting should be carefully monitored by experienced professionals.

, A chronic lack of quality sleep can significantly reduce the amount of testosterone a teenager or man produces, which then reduces muscle growth and promotes fat gain. Research has shown that quantity of sleep is associated with morning testosterone levels in males.More specifically, male testosterone levels in the morning increase with a longer duration of sleep. At least seven hours of restful sleep is recommended, although for many teenagers, nine hours is ideal to feel refreshed.


Avoid consuming stimulants (caffeine, alcohol) at least eight hours before heading to bed. Caffeine increases brain activity and makes it hard to fall asleep. Alcohol prevents you from getting a deep sleep.
Don't forget that caffeine is found in colas, energy drinks, coffee, black tea and chocolate.
Make your bedroom as relaxing, quiet and as dark as possible in order to promote good quality sleeps. Always turn off the computer and/or TV well before turning in for the night.

, Many people think that all fat is bad and should be avoided, particularly by teenagers who are overweight. However, natural fats and cholesterol from animal products (meat, eggs, dairy) are essential nutrients, especially for the production of sex-related hormones such as testosterone.Eating moderate amounts of saturated and unsaturated fats does not typically trigger weight gain — too many refined carbohydrates and artificial trans fat are the real culprits of obesity. In fact, some studies show that low-fat diets reduce testosterone levels in males, as well as create other growth and development problems.Research indicates that a diet with less than 40% of the energy derived from fat leads to decreased testosterone levels.Healthy examples of foods that contain high amounts of monounsaturated (plant-based) fats include almonds, walnuts, natural peanut butter, avocados and olive oil.
Examples of healthy foods with saturated (cholesterol containing) fat include lean red meat, seafood, eggs yolks, cheese, coconut oil and dark chocolate with a high percentage of cocoa.
Remember that cholesterol is needed to make testosterone, so consult your doctor about appropriate blood cholesterol levels for teenage boys — they may need more than average while going through puberty.

, Stress is ubiquitous in the modern world, particularly for teenagers who face a variety of pressures and expectations. High levels of stress triggers the release of the stress hormone cortisol, which tends to counteract the negative physiological effects of stress. That's certainly beneficial, but cortisol also blocks the effects and impact of testosterone within the body, which can cause significant problems for teenage boys.As such, try to provide a low-stress, stable environment for your teenager and give him opportunities to vent his frustrations and other emotions. Exercising, playing sports and developing enjoyable hobbies are all great at reducing stress.


Don't be afraid to see a mental health professional if stress levels are too great to cope with. Techniques such as cognitive-behavioral therapy can be effective for stress, anxiety and depression.
Popular stress-relieving practices include meditation, tai chi, yoga and breathing exercises.

, Zinc is a mineral needed for many body functions including healthy immune function, bone strength and the production of testosterone. In fact, low levels of zinc are correlated to low levels of testosterone in men and teenage boys.Mild zinc deficiency is now fairly common among Americans, so there's a good chance your teenage boy (particularly if he isn't a healthy eater) may be deficient. Ask your doctor for a blood test to get a better idea, but in the meantime, focus on serving and eating foods that are rich in zinc, such as meats, fish, low-fat milk, hard cheeses, beans and some nuts and seeds.


Zinc supplementation for as little as six weeks has shown to cause a significant improvement in testosterone levels among men.The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for zinc is 8-11 mg per day for teen males.It's much more challenging for vegetarians to get adequate amounts of zinc, so supplementation is a potential solution. You may need to consume as much as 50% more than the typical RDA., This makes sense when you realize that vitamin D acts more like a steroidal hormone than it does like any typical vitamin. A 2010 study looked at the relationship between vitamin D supplementation and testosterone levels in men and found that those with higher levels of the vitamin also had higher levels of testosterone in their blood.Vitamin D is made by human skin in response to intense summer sunshine, but a lack of going outdoors has triggered near epidemic levels of deficiency in American teenagers. Compounding this problem is that most northern states don't get enough sunshine to trigger vitamin D production for many months of the year.


Vitamin D is not common in foods, but good sources include cod liver oil, fatty fish, beef liver, egg yolks and fortified dairy products.
If supplementing with vitamin D, choose the D3 variety because it seems to be more effective and perhaps a little safer.
The recommended vitamin D blood levels are between 50 to 70 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml). Your doctor can refer you for a blood test to understand the vitamin D status.
The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D is 600 IU/15 mcg per day for teen males., DAA is an amino acid found in glandular tissues and it's thought to increase the activity of testosterone production and impact other hormones in the body. A 2009 study found that men who supplemented with 3,120 mg of DAA daily for 12 days experienced an increase in testosterone by an average of 42%.The results showed that DAA may have a key role in the regulation of the release and synthesis of testosterone in men, although it's likely to have similar effects on teenage males also. Another form of aspartic acid is made in the body and found in a variety of foods, but DAA is not as commonly found in food sources.


The best food sources of DAA are corn protein, casein, nondairy creamers and soy protein. It would be extremely difficult to get enough DAA from food sources to impact testosterone levels.
It's interesting to note that DAA supplementation impacts testosterone production in relatively inactive males the most, and may actually decrease levels in very active males (such as bodybuilders and serious athletes).Consult with your doctor before putting your teenager on supplements meant to impact his testosterone levels, especially since there are not many studies on DAA use in people at this time.

, Losing weight, eating the right foods, and getting more exercise are great ways to naturally increase testosterone while also improving your overall health. While mild to moderate changes are likely safe in most teenage boys, you should consult your doctor before making any significant changes to make sure those changes will be right for your specific health needs.


If you don't already exercise, your doctor may advise you to start with moderate-intensity cardiovascular exercise, like walking.Continue moderate-intensity exercise until your body adjusts to the new routine before introducing any high-intensity exercise or strength training.When you do progress into high-intensity exercise or strength training, make sure someone (like a trainer or coach) shows you the proper techniques involved to reduce your risk of injury.Before starting any routine--even a moderately intense one--you should check with your doctor if you have heart disease, lung disease (including asthma), diabetes, kidney disease, arthritis, or cancer. You should also check with your doctor if you are significantly overweight.If you get dizzy, feel short of breath, or experience abnormal pain while exercising, stop your new routine and consult your doctor., Low levels of zinc and vitamin D may contribute to low testosterone levels in teenage boys, so increasing these nutrients through diet or dietary supplements can also help boost your testosterone. If your zinc and/or vitamin D levels are already normal, though, use caution before further increasing those levels with supplements.


Increasing zinc and vitamin D through your diet is safer than using dietary supplements, and your body will likely absorb more of these nutrients when ingested through food, anyway.
If you choose to take dietary supplements, always make sure to follow the recommended dietary allowances (RDA), and be aware of the upper limits for each nutrient.

For zinc, the RDA for boys between 9 and 13 years old is 8 mg daily, while boys 14 through 18 years can take up to 11 mg daily. The tolerable upper intake level for boys 9 through 13 is 23 mg; for boys 14 through 18, this amount is 34 mg. Taking amounts greater than the upper intake level could be toxic.For vitamin D, the RDA for most teen boys is 600 IU/15 mcg per day. It's somewhat harder to overdose on vitamin D since it's generally not toxic until you take more than 50,000 IU daily, but it could be easier to overdose if you have certain health conditions., Even though many natural remedies for low testosterone are safe for most teenage boys, you should still consider making an appointment with your doctor if you're concerned you may have low testosterone.


Keep in mind that puberty occurs at different ages and at different rates, so you shouldn't necessarily be alarmed if your testosterone levels seem to be lower than those of your peers.
If you are concerned, your doctor can take a blood test to determine if your testosterone is abnormally low. Most doctors are willing to take your preference for natural treatments into consideration when designing a treatment plan, but your doctor will also let you know if medical treatments (i.e. prescription testosterone therapy) would be better for your circumstances.

, There are numerous herbal supplements that may claim to raise testosterone levels, but taking these can be risky, especially during your teenage years. Stick with medically-verified natural treatments. If these don't work for you, ask your doctor for further guidance.


While DAA supplements are possibly safe for most teenage boys, there are very few studies on the effects of DAA, especially with regards to teenagers. You should get approval from your doctor before trying it.
Avoid non-prescription use of testosterone supplements or steroids. Additionally, herbal supplements marketed toward those with low testosterone may lack medical support and could be unsafe, especially for developing teenagers.

Force yourself to cough and note if you felt or saw a bulge coming out of that area. You can also hold your breath and bear down (contract your abdomen as you were going to the bathroom). Use your finger to note if a bulge is coming out. Hernias can be aggravated by doing things that put pressure on the abdomen. You should also look for:A bulge in your groin area: If so, you may have a direct or indirect hernia.
You will see swelling in the lower part of your abdomen that extends down toward or even into your scrotum.
A bulge on the thigh below your groin: This is most likely a femoral hernia.
One testicle that's larger than the other or more swollen: This may be from an indirect hernia.
Burning, aching, or heavy pain in your groin: These can indicate a hernia because the intestine can become caught and squeezed, leading to pain. Seek emergency treatment if this occurs.
If the swelling is an oval shape that is not in your scrotum area, then it is probably a direct hernia rather than an inguinal hernia.;
, Feel if the hernia is reducible, or can be pushed back into place. Lay down to let gravity relieve the tension of the hernia back in place. Slowly apply pressure to the bulge using your index finger and try to push the contents back up. Do not force it, which could rupture the herniated products or the opening. If you can't reduce the hernia, see a healthcare professional immediately.


Let your doctor know if you've been or felt like vomiting in addition to not being able to push the bulge back in. This can mean there's a complication known as strangulation.
You need to see a doctor immediately if you have abdominal pain or a fever.
Strangulation of the intestine and blood vessels supplying it can deprive the intestine of proper nutrients. This will kill the tissue and keep it from functioning. You'll need surgery to remove the dead tissue so that digested products can pass through., You should get medical attention regardless of what kind of hernia you have. At the doctor's exam room, you'll need to remove all clothing below the waist and your doctor (and possibly an assistant) will inspect your abdomen and genitals for asymmetry and bulges. You'll be asked to bear down such as cough, or contract your abdomen while not breathing. A bulge suggests a hernia. Your doctor will also check to see if the hernia is reducible by palpating the area with an index finger.


Your doctor may listen against the bulge with a stethoscope for bowel sounds. If no bowel sounds are heard, this can indicate dead intestinal tissue or strangulation., There are several types of hernias that affect your abdomen or groin. If you think you have a hernia in these areas, it is likely one of these:Indirect inguinal hernia: This type is a congenital (birth) defect that causes the intestine and/or lining of the intestine to pass through the area where a man's testicles descended before birth. In most cases, this area didn't seal properly before birth, making it weak.
Direct inguinal hernia: This type is usually caused by trauma to the area like repeated stress from lifting heavy objects, frequent coughing, straining while using the bathroom, or pregnancy. The intestine, lining, or intestinal fat pass through these weakened muscles near the groin and genitals, but not through the scrotum or testes. It is most common in men over 40, but can occur in women as well.
Femoral hernia: This type is usually caused by pregnancy or childbirth, but can occur in men. The intestinal contents pass through a weakening in the lower groin, where the vessels supplying the thighs and legs pass through. Complications are more likely with femoral hernias, so keep your doctor up to date if symptoms change.

, Surgery is the most accepted and widely used treatment for hernias. But, if you're not experiencing symptoms and the hernia can be pushed back (reduced), you may want to wait. Either way, make an appointment with your doctor to get a professional opinion. If you know you'd like surgery, but your doctor advises you not to, because there aren't symptoms, you do have the right to elective surgery for cosmetic purposes. If you decide on surgery, make an appointment with a surgeon.If you plan on surgery, you'll need to have lab work done: labs for your blood values (PT, PTT, INR, and CBC),electrolytes such as sodium, potassium and glucose levels, and an ECG for detection of any heart abnormalities. Make an appointment with your primary care doctor to arrange your tests and have the results sent to your surgeon.

, With laparoscopic surgery, you'll be given anesthesia orally to reduce your pain and discomfort. The surgeon will inflate your abdomen with air so the tissues are more spread out and easier to work with. Next, a surgical probe is used as a camera to guide other probes that can cut, remove, and stitch. The probe will push the herniated products back in place. The probe will also apply a mesh to reinforce the weak abdominal wall. This will prevent future herniations. The small incisions from the probes will be sutured (stitched) at the end.Laparoscopic surgery is minimally invasive. It also leaves a smaller scar after surgery, causes less blood loss, and results in less pain following surgery.
Laparoscopic repair is favored over the open procedure if the hernia is bilateral, recurrent, or femoral.

, If you choose to have open surgery, the surgeon will make an incision along the groin to open the area up. Once open, the surgeon will manually push the contents back into the abdomen and look for passage of flatus. Then, the surgeon will likely apply a mesh around the weak abdominal muscles or tie the abdominal muscles together. This will prevent future herniations. The incision will be sutured, or stitched, at the end.If you have a larger hernia or are looking for a less expensive surgery, you should consider open surgery.
Open surgical repair is favored over laparoscopic repair if there has been prior surgery in that area, if this is your first inguinal hernia, if it is a large hernia, or if infection is a concern.

, Since you may have pain for a few weeks after the surgery, take any pain medications your doctor prescribes according to the directions. You should also make sure to eat a high-fiber diet or take 2 tablespoons of milk of magnesia twice a day following your surgery. After your surgery, it will take 1 to 5 days before you have a bowel movement and a high-fiber diet can improve your bowel function.To relieve pain, you can also place a cold pack wrapped in a towel over the area for about 20 minutes.

, Keep the bandages over the wound for up to 2 days. You may see some bleeding or drainage from the area which is normal. After 36 hours it’s ok to take a shower.Remove the gauze before showering and apply light pressure to the area when you're washing it with soap. When you're done, lightly pat the area dry with a towel. Apply a new fresh gauze to the area after each shower.


Avoid taking baths or soaking the wound in pools or hot tubs for at least 2 weeks., You won't have any medical or physical restrictions after surgery, but the area may still be tender. Try to avoid any activities that apply pressure to your abdomen for about a week. These activities include exercising, running, and swimming.


You should also wait to lift anything more than 10 lbs for up to 6 weeks or till you doctor tells you it's okay. Heavy lifting can aggravate a new hernia at the same site.Driving is discouraged during the first two weeks after surgery.
You can have sex after a hernia as long as it's not uncomfortable or painful.
Most patients will have recovered and gone back to work within a month of having herniorrhaphy.

, Talk with your doctor if you notice any of the following symptoms after your surgery:


Fever (101 F) and chills: A bacteria may have infected the surgical site.
Drainage of fluid from the surgical area that smells or looks like pus (usually brownish/green): Bacterial infections make these smelly and viscous fluid.
Constant bleeding from the surgical site: you may have ruptured a vessel that was never properly closed during surgery.
Trouble urinating: Fluid and inflammation are normal after surgery, but too much can compress the bladder or urethra causing trouble urinating. This can cause urine retention or the inability to empty your bladder fully.
Swelling or pain in testicles that's getting worse
The most common complication is recurrence of the hernia.

, If you're overweight or obese, try to lose weight by eating fewer calories and doing light exercises. Excess weight can make the weak areas in your abdomen carry more weight than they should. This increased pressure on weak abdominal points can increase your likelihood of having a hernia.


Make sure to choose exercises that don't increase the stress on your abdominal wall.Good moderate exercises to try include walking, jogging, swimming and bicycling.

, Fiber helps move your bowels and empty your intestine. High-fiber diets also loosen your stool which will reduce straining when you go to the bathroom. Eat lots of fiber-rich foods like wheat bread, fruits and vegetables. You should also drink lots of water throughout the day to keep your bowels moving.Fiber is especially important if you've had surgery for a hernia, because surgery and the use of pain medications can make your bowels slow down. This can lead to constipation which can aggravate your abdomen.

, Avoid or be careful when lifting heavy objects. You can start lifting objects over 10 pounds about 6 weeks after surgery. To properly lift, bend at the knees to lower yourself. Grasp the object you're lifting close to your body and lift up, using your knees, not your waist. This helps reduce the weight and stress on the abdomen from lifting and bending.You may also want to wear a supportive garment around your waist. This can help support your abdominal muscles, especially when lifting.

, Smoking is directly linked to chronic cough, which can cause and aggravate a hernia. If you've already had a hernia, it's extremely important that you avoid behaviors that can lead to another one, such as smoking."

Remain physically active.,
Consume plenty of calcium.,
Protect your bones by consuming more vitamin D. Along with calcium, vitamin D is the most vital nutrient for bone health.,
Reduce your tobacco and alcohol consumption.,
Perform weight-bearing exercises to cope with weak bones.",How to Protect Your Bones if You Have Low Testosterone1," Regardless of testosterone, bone health is important, and physical activity helps keep bones strong. Individuals who are physically inactive and lead a sedentary lifestyle are more likely to suffer from osteoporosis than those who exercise regularly.Even for individuals with low testosterone who are undergoing testosterone treatment, it’s important to remain physically active and to participate in activities that boost bone health.


Lifting weights will help encourage bone remodeling. Other forms of exercise—running, hiking, and playing sports like basketball—will also help with bone remodeling and help stave off osteoporosis.;
, A diet that is rich in calcium will improve your bone health and help stave off any losses of bone density caused by low testosterone. Try to include calcium-rich foods in each of your daily meals. Plan to consume foods including: milk, yogurt, cheese, and other dairy products; vegetables like broccoli and kale; and calcium-fortified foods including breads and cereals.While all men should consume calcium daily, it’s especially important that men over 50 consume at least 1,000 mg of calcium each day. If you’re over 50, check the nutrition label on your foods to make sure you’re consuming enough calcium.
If your diet is low in calcium, your bone density will be reduced and you’ll put yourself at risk for early loss of bone density and increased likelihood of bone fractures.

, Adults should consume between 600 and 800 international units (IUs) of vitamin D daily. Vitamin D can be consumed through vitamin supplements (available at your local health food store). Vitamin D is also found in fortified dairy products (along with calcium) and egg yolks, as well as fish and liver.If you’re concerned about your overall bone health or bone strength, or are worried that you may be suffering from osteoporosis, ask your doctor for a bone density screening. This procedure can remove the uncertainty of not knowing whether your bones are strong and healthy.

, Avoid smoking and other forms of tobacco use altogether, and moderate your drinking in order to maintain good bone health. Studies have indicated that prolonged tobacco use—whether cigarettes or chew tobacco—has a detrimental effect on bone strength. Excessive alcohol use—more than two drinks every day—is also linked to a higher risk of osteoporosis.Excessive alcohol consumption is detrimental to your bone health, as it diminishes your body’s ability to form new bone cells., If you are already afflicted with weak bones—including already suffering from osteoporosis—your best non-medical treatment will come through exercise. Individuals with weak bones can strengthen them through so-called “weight bearing” exercises, which place weight on your bones to mimic the strain that comes with supporting your body. Pushing a vacuum cleaner and mowing the lawn are two examples of weight-bearing exercises.Also start a regimen of resistance weight training to improve bone density. You can work on resistance training at a gym, using a weight machine or free weights, or at your home, using resistance-specific elastic bands.
If you’re interested in finding out more about specific exercises you can do to strengthen bones—and any that you should avoid—consult with your doctor.

Get tested for low testosterone.,
Talk with your doctor about treatment options.,
Ask to undergo testosterone treatment.,
Decide on the method of treatment that’s best for you.",How to Protect Your Bones if You Have Low Testosterone2," Before you make any assumptions about the state of your bodily hormones or the conditions of your bones, visit your primary-care physician to be tested for low testosterone. Testosterone is tested via a blood sample taken early in the morning, when testosterone levels are at their highest. Your doctor will likely want to test your blood again a few days after the initial test, to make sure that the first indicated testosterone level was not an anomaly.Low testosterone can be signaled by any of the following conditions: loss of bone density (which can be signaled by frequent fractures), low sex drive, anemia, depression, weight gain, and frequent fatigue.

, If you have low testosterone and are concerned about developing osteoporosis or have concerns about the strength and health of your bones, schedule an appointment to speak with your doctor. The doctor may recommend that you visit a specialist: most likely a urologist or an endocrinologist.Express to your primary-care physician and to the specialists you visit that you’re concerned about your bone health and the potential future threat of osteoporosis.
Before beginning testosterone treatment, your doctor and endocrinologist will likely need to run tests to make sure that you do have low testosterone and are not suffering from another medical concern that weakens bones.

, Testosterone treatment—also known as testosterone replacement—is a means of increasing the testosterone levels within men who have low levels of the hormone. If your doctor and relevant specialists decide that your testosterone levels will not increase naturally, and that your bone health will consequently decrease, you can begin the testosterone treatment process.Male testosterone levels naturally drop as men age, and only become a medical concern if the low hormone levels cause a decrease in quality of life, including bone health.
While testosterone alone affects bone health and strengthens bones, part of its benefit to bones also comes through the conversion of testosterone into estrogen, which preserves bone density.

, Based on your and your doctor’s preference and the amount of testosterone you’ll need to be treated with, treatment can take a variety of forms. Testosterone treatment is commonly administered via patches or gels (applied directly to your skin), injections, or pills and tablets which are taken orally.Seek your doctor’s recommendation when considering treatment options. Your doctor may have worked with patients who experience bone stress due to low testosterone before, and can provide recommendations about which type of treatment works best.

Consider the increased risk of prostate cancer.,
Ask your doctor about other risks from testosterone treatment.,
Avoid testosterone treatment if you’re being treated for cancer.,
Avoid taking testosterone-boosting supplements.",How to Protect Your Bones if You Have Low Testosterone3," Testosterone treatment is a generally safe medical procedure—however, the most serious possible risk for men is prostate cancer. Studies have indicated that the risk of prostate cancer as a result of testosterone treatments is highest among African-American men and men over 40.All men over the age of 50 need to be monitored for prostate cancer while receiving testosterone treatments.

, A variety of health concerns can develop from testosterone treatments. Working with your doctor, you may be able to reduce the risk of these medical conditions by regulating the amount of testosterone you receive with each treatment and the duration of your testosterone treatments. Other possible risks of testosterone treatment include:Increased red blood cell count
Acne
Reduced sperm count
Sleep apnea
Enlarged or tender breasts

, Testosterone-boosting treatments are generally not recommended for men undergoing cancer treatment—especially if the treatment is for prostate cancer, since testosterone treatment can increase the size of the prostate.As you undergo testosterone treatment, be sure to continue having your testosterone levels checked, in order to monitor their resurgence or continued diminishment.

, You should only plan to increase your testosterone levels through doctor-prescribed treatments, and through natural methods like exercise and diet modification. Many supplements—including those advertised online or in infomercials—will do your body little good and will not help boost testosterone levels.This supplement restriction includes taking supplements of hormone DHEA: a naturally produced hormone that your body converts into testosterone. Your body produces DHEA on its own, and taking DHEA supplements will have little effect on your testosterone levels.
If you’ve heard about a herbal testosterone treatment or are thinking of beginning a homeopathic method, always ask your doctor before you begin.

Rest your shoulder injury.,
Apply ice to acute shoulder pain.,
Apply moist heat to chronic shoulder pain.,
Take some over-the-counter medication.,
Attempt some light shoulder stretches.,
Consult with your family doctor.,
Get a referral to a physiotherapist.,
Try a shoulder massage.,
Try trigger point treatments.,
Consider acupuncture for your shoulder.",How to Fix Shoulder Pain for Athletes," Shoulder pain in an athlete is usually caused by overexertion or some kind of awkward fall or positioning. These sorts of mishaps can happen while playing sports (football, hockey, baseball, volleyball and tennis, in particular) or training for them while at the gym. The best advice when you feel significant shoulder pain (not just mild aches that are common from working out) is to take a break from all activity that stresses the involved shoulder. After a few days of rest, you may be surprised at your body's ability to heal the injury.


If your shoulder pain is related to lifting weights at the gym, then you may be working out too aggressively or with bad form — consult with a personal trainer.
Although resting your shoulder for a few day is a beneficial, completely immobilizing it in a sling is not recommended for minor strain / sprain injuries — it promotes the development of ""frozen"" shoulder (adhesive capsulitis). At least some gentle shoulder motion is needed to encourage blood flow and stimulate healing.Achy shoulder pain usually indicates a muscle strain, whereas sharp pain with movement is often caused by joint / ligament injuries. Shoulder joint pain is usually worse at night while in bed compared to pain generated mainly from muscle pulls. Certain inflammatory conditions, such as bursitis, may also cause a worsening of shoulder pain at night. If your shoulder pain gets worse at night, see your doctor immediately.;
, If your shoulder pain is acute (new) and involves swelling, then apply a bag of crushed ice (or something cold) to the most tender area in order to reduce inflammation and numb the pain.Cold therapy is best for acute sports injuries that involve inflammation. Apply the crushed ice for about 15 minutes or so every couple of hours until the discomfort in your shoulder subsides.


Compressing the ice tightly against your sore shoulder with a Tensor or Ace bandage is even more effective at reducing swelling.
Always wrap crushed ice or ice cubes in a thin towel before you apply it to your skin — it prevents potential irritation and frostbite.
If you don't have any type of ice, then use a frozen gel pack or bag of veggies from the freezer — frozen peas or corn works great.

, If your shoulder pain is chronic (long term) and caused from overuse or an old injury, then apply moist heat instead of ice — particularly if the pain feels stiff and achy instead of sharp. Moist heat warms up the soft tissues (muscles, tendons, ligaments) and increases blood flow to the area, which can be helpful when recovering from an old sports injury or dealing with ""wear and tear"" type arthritis (osteoarthritis).Great sources of moist heat include microwavable bags filled with grains (usually wheat or rice), herbs and/or essential oils. Toss the bag in the microwave for a few minutes and then apply it to your chronic shoulder pain for 15 to 20 minutes first thing in the morning and before any type of light exercise.


Remember to cover the herbal bag with a towel to help keep the heat from dissipating too quickly.
Taking a warm bath also provides moist heat to achy soft tissues. Add some Epsom salt for even better results — the magnesium in the salt relaxes and soothes sore muscles.
Avoid applying dry heat from regular heating pads. They can dehydrate muscles and increase the risk of injury.

, If your shoulder pain isn't impacted greatly by applying ice or moist heat, then try taking some over-the-counter anti-inflammatories or pain killers. Anti-inflammatories are more appropriate for acute shoulder injuries involving significant inflammation, such as moderate-to-severe sprains and strains, bursitis and tendonitis. Common anti-inflammatories include aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) and naproxen (Aleve). Pain killers are more appropriate for pain not obviously caused by inflammation, such as nerve irritation and general wear and tear achiness. Pain killers (analgesics) almost always include acetaminophen (Tylenol and Paracetamol) as the main ingredient. Keep in mind that these medications are short-term solutions for shoulder pain and not meant to be taken regularly for more than a couple weeks at a stretch — they can lead to stomach, kidney and liver issues.Another option for shoulder pain, particular if you feel spasms or tightness in the muscles, is taking muscle relaxants (such as cyclobenzaprine), but don't combine them with anti-inflammatories or analgesics.
Whatever medications you try, always take them with food and not on an empty stomach.
Keep in mind that ibuprofen and aspirin are not recommended for young kids — aspirin, in particular, has been linked to Reye's syndrome.
Always follow the instructions and dosage information on the drug's packaging.

, If your shoulder injury is not severe and does not involve sharp, stabbing or shooting pain, then try some light shoulder stretches after a day or so of rest. Stretching is not a good idea for shoulder dislocations or severe strains and sprains, but less serious injuries often respond well to light stretches because it relieves muscle tension, stimulates blood flow and improves flexibility.Hold the shoulder stretches for about 30 seconds and do them at least three times per day until the pain fades away.


Mild movement and light stretches reduces the chances of scar tissue, chronic stiffness and loss of mobility from developing in the shoulder.
While standing or sitting with a straight back, reach around the front of your body and grab the opposite elbow. Gently pull on the back of the elbow across your chest until you feel a stretch in the corresponding shoulder muscles. Hold for 30 seconds and then repeat three times.
Again while standing or sitting erect, reach behind your back towards your shoulder blade and interlock with the opposite hand. Then slowly pull on the hand with the shoulder pain until you feel a good stretch.
While sitting in a chair, bring the affected shoulder behind your back, with your palm facing away from your body. Slowly lean back so that your back is resting against the back of the seat and pressing against your hand. Slowly rotate your body to the same side as the stretched shoulder. You should feel a nice gentle stretch. Hold this position for 30 seconds. Rest, and then repeat the stretch four more times. If you feel any increase in pain or discomfort, stop the exercise.

, Although your doctor is not likely a shoulder specialist or an athletic therapist accustomed to dealing with sports injuries, they can certainly help you understand the type and severity of your injury. Most shoulder injuries are mild-to-moderate strains and sprains, which usually take one to two weeks to heal. More serious shoulder injuries include a joint dislocation, shoulder separation (sprained acromioclavicular joint), torn rotator cuff muscles, bursitis and bone fractures (of the upper arm, shoulder blade and/or collar bone).These serious injuries can take up to six months to heal (depending on complications), but your doctor can give you a good idea of prognosis and necessary treatment.


If warranted, your doctor may take an x-ray, bone scan, MRI or nerve conductance study to diagnosis your shoulder pain / injury.
Fractures, torn muscles / ligaments and some dislocations require shoulder surgery — your doctor will refer you to an orthopedic surgeon in these cases.
Bursitis (inflamed bursa), tendinitis, shoulder separations and severe sprains can often benefit from a local corticosteroid injection (prednisolone). Corticosteroids quickly reduce inflammation and pain, and improve range of motion. Ask your doctor about the pros and cons of corticosteroid injections., For athletes, its not only important to fix the shoulder pain, but also to ensure the joint is stable and strong so it can withstand the demands of their sport. As such, seeing a physiotherapist is an important part of your recovery because they can show you specific stretches and strengthening exercises to rehabilitate your shoulder.Strengthening exercises typically involve weight lifting or pulling on rubber bands under tension. Physical therapy is usually required two to three times per week for four to eight weeks to positively impact significant shoulder injuries. You'll be allowed to return to your sport once your shoulder is pain free and has full strength and mobility.


If warranted, a physiotherapist can treat your injured shoulder muscles with therapeutic ultrasound or electronic muscle stimulation, which can make a quick impact on pain.
In addition to resistance training, other good strengthening exercises for the shoulder include push-ups, pull-ups, swimming and rowing.

, If your shoulder pain is not too severe and you're still able to move the joint without too much difficulty, then getting a deep tissue massage from a qualified therapist is a good strategy. Deep tissue massage alleviates muscle tightness and tension, improves flexibility and flushes out inflammation — all of which contribute to the sensation of pain.Massage is most helpful for mild-to-moderate shoulder muscle strains, but it's not recommended for more serious shoulder joint injuries (mentioned above). Get a diagnosis of your shoulder injury before considering massage therapy.


Start with a 30-minute massage session focusing on your injured shoulder, but also including your neck and mid-back between your shoulder blades. One session may ""fix"" your pain, but a few more sessions may be required.
Allow the therapist to go as deep as you can tolerate it, as there are many muscle layers in your shoulder that may need attention.
Always drink lots of purified water after a massage or else you risk getting a headache and feeling a little nauseous.

, Some shoulder pain can come from muscle knots, also known as trigger points. Trigger points can often cause local pain or pain to other areas of your body. For example, a muscle knot in the middle back can refer pain to the top of the shoulder joint. Trigger point therapy, or myofascial release, can help to relieve this type of muscle pain.Try seeking trigger point treatments from a health professional who is trained in trigger point therapy. Someone who is trained in trigger point therapy can search your shoulder muscles and muscles in other areas, such as your mid back, to find the underlying cause of your pain.

, Acupuncture is a treatment modality developed many centuries ago in China designed to reduce pain and stimulate healing.Acupuncture involves sticking very thin needles into the skin at specific points (sometimes close to the injury, but often in distant parts of the body) for between 15 to 45 minutes per session. The needles trigger pain-reducing compounds (such as endorphins) to be released into the bloodstream, so pain can disappear quickly with acupuncture. Although the effectiveness of acupuncture is not well studied for shoulder pain specifically, it has proven very helpful for most musculoskeletal injuries. Furthermore, given it's excellent safety record and relatively low expense, it's certainly a good option for athletes trying to fix their shoulder pain.


Acupuncture is now practiced by a wide variety of healthcare practitioners, including some physicians, chiropractors, physiotherapists and massage therapists.
Whichever professional you decide upon should be NCCAOM certified.
One acupuncture treatment may make a significant impact on your shoulder pain, but sometimes it takes a few more session, so be patient for results.

Determine if you have muscle pain.,
Recognize other symptoms of chikungunya.,
Know the differences between chikungunya and dengue fever.,
Visit your doctor.,
Know how long the infection might last.,
Know that the illness is not fatal, but there is no treatment.",How to Ease Muscle Pain from Chikungunya1," The chikungunya virus is transmitted through the bite of Aedes mosquitoes. As the virus enters the body, it runs through the blood vessels. The virus mainly affects the human endothelial and epithelial cells known as fibroblasts. These fibroblasts usually make up the muscle tissue. As the infection progresses, these fibroblasts are damaged and epithelial and endothelial cells die. The injury to the muscle’s fibroblasts result in muscle pain.;
, A person may suffer multiple symptoms in addition to muscle and joint pain. These might include:


High fever of 102 degrees F or more.
Severe lethargy.
Inability to get up and walk around, or a stiff gait and halted with broad stance, owing to severe painful swollen joints.
A red and slightly raised rash that does not itch. The rash will appear on the trunk and extremities.
Blistering on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, causing peeling of the skin.
Other symptoms, which are usually less prominent, include: headache, vomiting, sore throat, and nausea.

, The symptoms of chikungunya have a great deal of overlap with dengue fever. The geographic locations where people are infected are similar. Sometimes a diagnostic dilemma is created and providers face a clinical challenge in making the diagnosis. However, the joint pain is so marked with chikungunya that this generally makes the diagnosis clear.


Dengue has more prominent muscle pains or “myalgias,” but the joints are typically spared.

, Diagnosis is based on the signs and symptoms. Usually, to confirm a diagnosis of chikungunya, the doctor will order a blood test. The test will detect the presence of Chikungunya antibodies in the blood that will indicate exposure of the patient to the virus.


Blood will be drawn out of the patient’s vein and will be put in a sterile container for examination in the laboratory.
There are ample laboratory tests to confirm that you have chikungunya. The most widely used is the RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction), which checks for the virus. The disease leaves a huge viral load, so it is readily detected. This massive viral load is likely responsible for the patients feeling so terrible.

, The acute infection lasts from days to two weeks. During this time, you will likely be extremely fatigued with high fever and the extremely painful joints and muscles, almost incapable of walking.


Then you will enter a subacute phase, which can continue for months to years. Sixty-three percent of patients still experience joint pain and swelling a year after the initial infection.In the long term, you may experience a form of seropositive arthritis or rheumatism that has the HLA B27 antibody. This is similar to a more common post-infectious arthritis, known as Reiter’s syndrome., , Despite the terrible symptoms, the disease is not typically deadly. However, there is no treatment other than supportive care, similar to other viral illnesses. There have been trials with certain drugs to try treating the illness, but these drugs have not been shown to be efficacious.

Avoid doing any activities that involve using your affected shoulder. Avoid lifting heavy objects and using repetitive movements while resting. This helps to reduce inflammation.
However, prolonged rest is not advisable as mobilization of the joints and muscles is important to promote good blood circulation. Do not take more than 24 hours of rest.;
, Cold packs are best used on muscle injuries and muscle strains. This helps to ease the pain and control inflammation.


Cold temperatures cause the blood vessels to narrow, which can help to control muscle inflammation in the shoulder. By minimizing inflammation, further damage to the shoulder can be prevented.
Apply cold packs on the affected muscle for 15 to 20 minutes, several times per day. However, cold packs are only beneficial for the first 24 to 48 hours after an injury.

, After applying cold packs for the first 24 to 48 hours, the next step is to apply warm packs.


Warm temperatures help to dilate blood vessels and improve blood circulation to the shoulder, minimizing inflammation and damage.
You can apply a warm pack for 15 to 20 minutes several times a day, but be careful that the warm packs are not too hot, otherwise they can burn your skin.

, You can do self-massage to relieve pain and relax tensed muscles. Using your fingers, apply minimal to moderate pressure on the shoulder muscle using a circular motion. This encourages blood flow and helps to relieve pain.


Massage can be performed several times daily or as needed. You can also seek the services of a professional massage therapist to treat your shoulder pain.

, You can use several pillows to prop up your injured shoulder. Elevation helps with inflammation, as the effects of gravity help to pull down excessive fluid and blood that are lodged in a certain area, thus promoting proper circulation.


When lying in bed, it is best to elevate your back at a 45-degree angle.

, Tobacco products contain a lot of harmful chemicals, including nicotine. Cigarettes are to be avoided as they cause a delay in muscle healing and repair. They also make the blood viscous, which interferes with proper blood circulation and results in decreased blood supply, thus delaying healing.

, Pain medications are used to alleviate pain and inflammation of certain muscles. Pain medication acts by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins in the body tissues, by inhibiting 2 Cyclooxygenase (COX) isoenzymes (COX-1 and COX-2) which are responsible for pain and inflammation. Some of the most commonly used painkillers are as follows:


Ibuprofen (Advil). This is available in 200 mg tablets to be taken every 4 to 6 hours, not exceeding a dose of 1.2g per day.
Acetaminophen (Tylenol). This is available in 325 mg tablets to be taken every 4 to 6 hours or as needed. Do not exceed 4 g per day.
Mefenamic acid. This is available in 250 mg and 500 mg tablets. 500 mg is to be taken initially, followed by 250 mg every 4 to 6 hours or as needed.
Naproxen. This is available in 250 mg and 500 mg tablets . 500 mg is to be taken initially followed by 250 mg every 6 to 8 hours or as needed. Do not exceed 1250 mg/day.

, Pain occurs as a result of inflammation. In order to control pain, inflammation needs be treated first. Muscle inflammation is treated using corticosteroids, which are the drugs of choice for treating any kind of inflammation.


They control inflammation by controlling the rate of protein synthesis, which suppresses the migration of leukocytes (also called white blood cells, which are responsible for the body’s immunity) and fibroblasts (a type of cell responsible for synthesizing extracellular matrix and collagen, which plays a role in wound healing).
The most common corticosteroid prescribed by doctors is prednisone 5 mg, which is usually prescribed to treat mild to moderate forms of inflammation.

, Cortisone is another type of steroid which manages inflammation. Synthetic cortisone acts for a longer period of time but it controls only the inflammation, not the pain itself.


A cortisone injection is injected by your doctor into the inflamed area - in this case, your shoulder. When inflammation is diminished, pain is also reduced.

, If you experience severe pain, redness, and inflammation of your shoulder or you are unable to move your shoulder, go to the nearest hospital, as the radiating pain may be a sign of an impending heart attack.


If this is the case, it can be very serious so do not delay and seek medical help immediately. Other joint and muscle symptoms which should prompt you to get professional help are:
Swelling that surrounds your shoulder, severe pain that is not being relieved by home-care and self-care treatments, and stiffness which is caused by inflammation in the shoulder capsule and freezes shoulder movements.

, These can help to stretch the muscles and tissues, thus easing the pain. After resting the shoulder, stretching exercises should be done to promote blood circulation to the shoulders. Below are some examples of different kinds of shoulder stretches.

, Slide it down to the right side of your body then raise your left shoulder as your right shoulder goes down. Hold the position for 10 seconds, then repeat with your opposite shoulder.

, Interlock the fingers on both your hands and stretch them upwards, as high as you can, and hold for 10 seconds.

, Loosen your back muscle by crossing both arms and reaching behind your back slowly and as far as possible for 10 seconds. It will look like you’re hugging yourself tightly.

, Bend your right arm over your head and bend your left arm around the back of your head. Interlock the fingertips of both hands and hold for 10 seconds. Repeat on the opposite side.

, Clasp your hands behind your back, so the thumbs are facing downwards. Extend your arms backwards while leaning your body forwards. Hold for 10 seconds.

, Place your right hand at the back of your left shoulder then apply minimal pressure on the right elbow using your left hand. Hold that position for 20 seconds, then repeat on the opposite side.

Relax.,
Try progressive muscle relaxation.,
Keep your breath fresh.,

Use aromatherapy.,
Experiment with peppermint.,
Try acupressure.",How to Ease Nausea During a Migraine1," Dehydration can worsen symptoms of migraine, as well as making the symptoms harder to treat by other methods.Try to drink water even if in small sips to help avoid making your nausea worse.


Many migraine sufferers experience what is called a prodromal period of the migraine, which is the presence of symptoms before the truly painful attack of the headache. This period may include increased sensitivity to light and sound, as well as seeing a clouding or patterned change in your vision known as a visual “aura.” For best results, begin drinking water as soon as you identify the prodromal period of your oncoming migraine.;
, Pressure against your abdomen can increase the perception of nausea.If possible, remove tight-fitting clothing and put on something comfortable and loose fitting.


If you’re at work or someplace else where changing isn’t possible, remove (or at least loosen) your belt and undo the top button of your pants.

, By reducing other symptoms of your migraine, you can also help alleviate the associated nausea and discomfort. One of the most common symptoms of migraine is sensitivity to light and sound.Try secluding yourself to a dark room with minimal amounts of outside noise.If the silence leads you to focus too much on the nausea or throbbing headache, then try music you find soothing at a very low volume.

, Many OTC pain relievers (such as Tylenol and Excedrin) have special formulas meant to target migraines.Take according to the manufacturer’s recommended dosage, and never exceed the specified daily amount on the packaging.


Most OTC formulas for migraine work better than normal formulas because they contain both acetaminophen and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which are usually packaged separately.However, they contain the substances in a safe balance. Many also contain caffeine. You should not mix OTC drugs on your own.

, Caffeine can assist in relieving migraine pain.You can try having a small cup of coffee or a portion of a caffeinated soda to help alleviate pain.


This can often help enhance the pain-relieving effect of an OTC painkiller, especially acetaminophen (Tylenol).Beware that caffeine is one of the substances that can also trigger migraines in some sufferers.Discontinue trying this step if it seems to worsen or elongate your migraine and nausea symptoms.

, Try both hot and cold compresses both on your head and the back of your neck.Migraine sufferers have reported both being helpful, but the effect is different for each individual. You may respond well to warm compresses but hate cold ones. See what works for you.


Ice packs can have a numbing effect on the pain, whereas hot compresses can help relieve muscle tension.Always wrap ice packs in a towel and alternate fifteen-minute periods of applying and taking away the pack to avoid any potential tissue damage from the cold.

, You may find that eating something bland can help to settle your stomach. Try to eat small amounts of bland food, like dry saltine crackers or plain yogurt. Pace yourself while eating, taking small bites of food to keep from overwhelming your stomach.Eating heavy meals can increase the pressure inside your stomach. With increased pressure, your nausea will get worse and may even lead to vomiting.

, Since stress and exertion are two common migraine triggers, simply trying to relax is another way to help with symptoms.For best results, try to identify your oncoming migraine in the prodromal stage before the onset of pain. Try to get off your feet and remove yourself from a stressful environment during this stage of your migraine before it has a chance to get worse.


If you practice yoga or other forms of meditation, these can also assist with relaxation in a way the helps with migraine symptoms., Progressive muscle relaxation is one common technique that can help with migraine symptoms.Starting with your toes and working toward your head, tense individual muscle groups for five seconds before progressively relaxing them for thirty seconds.After each group, move to the next in ascending order.


This technique helps you focus on both muscle tension and relaxation throughout your whole body.In addition to the relaxing effects, the focus on other portions of your body will disrupt your fixation on the migraine symptoms.
Pay special focus on relaxing your abdominal muscles since tension here can increase the perception of nausea.

, Nausea can be a vicious cycle, especially if you actually vomit and prolong your nausea due to the acrid taste in your mouth. Rinse your mouth or brush your teeth and tongue to avoid making your nausea worse or last longer than necessary.

, Ginger has been associated with both migraine prevention and nausea relief, and some have reported reduced pain and frequency of migraines while using ginger.Either fresh or powdered ginger steeped to make tea is the most common way to use ginger, though fresh is preferred if it is available.


You can also simply eat fresh ginger. However, the strong taste of ginger may be too much for the increased senses of taste and smell that can worsen nausea for migraine sufferers.

, Different scents can have either beneficial or detrimental effects when it comes to nausea symptoms. Lavender and peppermint are two common smells that people find calming.Consider using one or two drops of an essential oil on a cotton ball to see if these scents help calm the gastrointestinal spasms contributing to your nausea.

, Peppermint contains menthol which may be effective in treating migraine pain as well as easing nausea triggered by a migraine. Peppermint soothes the lining of your stomach thereby treating nausea.Take a teaspoon of peppermint leaves and add them to a cup of water. Cover the water and allow it to steep for about five minutes. Add honey to taste.

, Acupressure is a practice based on the same strategies used in acupuncture, except that you use pressure from your finger and not needles. Pressing points helps to release muscle tension and promote blood circulation to the area.Pressure point P-6 is a point on the inner arm that helps to relieve nausea and vomiting. Position your hand with your fingers pointing to the ceiling. Your palm should face you. Place the first three fingers of your other hand across your wrist so the fingers are running down the length of your arm. Place your thumb on the point just below the finger closest to the elbow, you should feel two large tendons. Press on this point using a circular motion for two to three minutes. This should not elicit any pain. Repeat on the other side."

Get as much rest as possible.,
Stay hydrated.,
Take a fever reducer.,
Try a heating pad.,
Ask your doctor about narcotic pain medication.",How to Ease Muscle Pain from Chikungunya2," There is no cure for chikungunya, so you will have to do what you can to support your body's natural healing abilities. One way to support your body's natural healing abilities is to get as much rest as possible.Sleep as much as you can and take it easy during the day.


Make yourself as comfortable as possible with pillows and blankets.
Plan to rest for about two weeks, if not longer.

, Muscle tissue is composed of 75% water.When you have low hydration levels in your body, your muscles can be more susceptible to seizing up, cramping and other discomfort.Chikungunya brings a high fever, which contributes significantly to dehydration, putting your muscles at further risk for cramping.


Drink plenty of water and other fluids to ensure you stay hydrated.
If nausea is present, take small sips at frequent intervals, drinking water, Gatorade or electrolyte mixtures. Make your own electrolyte mixture with six cups of water, one cup of sugar and two teaspoons of salt.
Be sure to monitor for dehydration. Patients with this illness are at risk of becoming dehydrated. It’s likely that the patient needs to be prompted to eat and drink due to lethargy and weakness as well as inability to care for oneself. Diarrhea and vomiting do not predominate in this illness, so these are not likely to be the main causes of dehydration.
If you are dehydrated, you may need intravenous fluids to rehydrate.

, Antipyretics, also known as fever reducers, may help you manage your fever. They can also be used to manage joint pain. Try taking some acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, or paracetamol to help reduce your fever and joint pain.Make sure that you read and follow the manufacturer's instructions for use. Do not exceed the recommended dosage of any over the counter medicine.

, Holding a heating pad on your joints and other painful areas may bring some temporary relief for your joint pain. Try holding an electric heating pad on your joints for up to 20 minutes at a time. Make sure that you remove the heating pad after 20 minutes and give your skin a break for about an hour to avoid overheating or burning your skin.


You can also use a hot water bottle if you do not have a heating pad. You can fill a plastic water bottle with hot water and wrap a paper towel or cloth around it.
You may even want to try alternating an ice pack with a heating pad. Ice can help to numb pain in your joints while heat tends to increase blood flow and soothe muscles.Make sure that you wrap the ice pack with a paper towel and do not keep an ice pack on for more than 20 minutes at a time either.

, Discuss narcotic pain medication such as Norco for severe muscle pain. Norco combines hydrocodone and acetaminophen. Many cases of chikungunya are debilitating enough to warrant this type of medication.


The recommended dosage of Norco is 325 milligrams orally every four hours.
Don’t take this medication with Tylenol or any other acetaminophen.

Increase your intake of vitamin C. Enhance your body’s ability to fend off muscle pain by taking 1,000 milligrams of vitamin C twice daily.This will also help boost your immune system.,
Take vitamin D to help with chronic pain.,
Drink green tea.,
Take ginseng extract.,
Try aged garlic.",How to Ease Muscle Pain from Chikungunya3," It may be tough to get this much from food alone but fresh fruits and vegetables are always the best source if possible. You can also take supplements. Some of the most nutrient rich sources of vitamin C include:


Oranges: 69mg of vitamin C per serving.
Chili peppers: 107 mg of vitamin C per serving.
Red Bell Peppers: 190 mg of Vitamin C per serving.

, Low levels of vitamin D have been linked to chronic pain.In addition, vitamin D may help improve muscle fatigue and recovery time.Take 200 iu (two capsules) of vitamin D3 daily. Although you can get vitamin D from sunshine, you’ll be resting inside, so you’ll likely need to take supplements.

, Muscle pain can be in part caused by inflammation. Green tea is known to be an anti-inflammatory treatment that can help with muscle pain.Green tea also causes upregulation of the body’s natural killer cells that are responsible for targeting infectious agents. Therefore, green tea can help fight illness and enhance immunity.


Drink at least one cup daily., According to experts, ginseng extract can facilitate the body’s immune response. It can also relieve exhaustion and muscle pain that you may experience with an illness that consumes a lot of your energy, such as chikungunya.There is no medical consensus on dosing. Follow the product’s label for dosing instructions., Aged garlic supplements can help reduce muscle soreness and pain. The chemical allicin, which is contained in garlic, may contribute to this reduction.Aged garlic can also help the body’s natural killer cells to activate immunity.Try taking aged garlic supplements to help fight the infection.

Use mosquito nets.,
Use bug repellent spray.,
Wear long sleeves and pants.,
Don’t leave out open containers of water.,
Be cautious around areas where there are outbreaks.",How to Ease Muscle Pain from Chikungunya4," If you are traveling or living in an area that has outbreaks of chikungunya, take precautions so that you minimize your risk of infection. Protect your sleeping area with a mosquito net treated with insecticide.If you sleep with any part of your body pressed against the net, you may still be at risk of being bitten through the net., Use a product that contains DEET, picaridin, or IR3535 to protect yourself against bug bites. You might also try products that contain oil of lemon eucalyptus or para-menthane-diol. Reapply the spray according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Make sure your bug repellent contains sufficient insecticide to kill mosquitos.If you’re using sunscreen and bug repellent, apply the sunscreen first and then the bug repellent over it., Cover up your body to prevent mosquitos from having access to your skin. Wear long pants and shirts with long sleeves., Uncovered water catchments, cisterns and buckets are breeding grounds for mosquito larvae. Cover these up, especially if you have four or more catchments in a 10-meter radius of your dwelling., Chikungunya is spread by getting bitten by an infected mosquito, “the vector” of the species Aedes, which has caused clustered outbreaks in areas surrounding the Indian Ocean. Outbreaks continue to be a risk until the public health issue of the mosquito problem is better controlled. "

Explain your condition.,
Tell them about the pain scale.,
Describe the type of pain.,
Detail your treatment.,
Use the spoon theory.",How to Explain Your Chronic Pain to Others1," To start telling someone about your chronic pain, you should explain to them the root of your pain. You may not feel comfortable giving specific details, and you don’t need to. You may want to tell the person what hurts you, like your back, head, or entire body. You may also choose to tell them the cause, like lupus, fibromyalgia, or IBS.If you don’t feel like going into all the details, you may suggest that the person research the condition. You may also choose to print out basic information for the person to read.;
, Most people with chronic pain evaluate the pain on a pain scale. You should tell the person about this scale so they can understand the intensity of your pain when you give them a number. The pain scale ranges from one to 10.Pain that is a one to three is minor pain. You can go about your daily activities.
Pain between four and seven is moderate. This pain interferes with your daily activities.
Pain between eight and 10 is severe. This pain is debilitating and causes you to be unable to do daily activities.

, You can also try describing what the pain is like in terms the other person might understand. For instance, you could use words like stabbing, dull, sharp, tingling, throbbing, feeling warm/hot/numb, etc. It might also be helpful to to compare it to minor pain that the other person may have felt (if applicable). ""It kinda feels like the pinch from a shot, but never goes away,"" or, ""It feels like a rubber band snap."", If you feel comfortable enough, you may want to explain your treatment to the person. That may include medication you are taking, physical therapy you undergo, or any alternative treatments you receive. This might help the person understand what you are doing to treat your pain.You may not feel comfortable discussing your medication, but you feel comfortable talking about relaxation techniques, acupuncture, and physical therapy you undergo.
Explaining that you are undergoing treatment might stop the other person from asking questions like, “Why aren’t you doing anything for the pain?” or trying to give you medical advice.

, If you are trying to explain your chronic pain to someone, you may try using the spoon theory to get the idea across. The spoon theory assigns a common daily task to each spoon a person carries. Someone without chronic pain has unlimited spoons, because they can make unlimited choices without consequence. A person with chronic pain has a limited amount of spoons, and when the spoons are gone, you have nothing left to give.For example, you may give someone 15 spoons to hold. Have them go through their daily tasks. Most tasks need to be broken into smaller tasks, such as bathing. Bathing includes washing your hair, drying off, getting into the tub — which can very easily be three spoons.
This idea helps a person understand how each decision matters that you make during the day and how you have a limited amount of energy to give each day.

Manage your triggers.,
See your doctor.,
Ask about triptans.,
Ask about anti-nausea medications.",How to Ease Nausea During a Migraine2," For many people, migraines and the subsequent symptoms—including nausea—are triggered by sources that they can control or reduce their exposure to.Keep track of what you were doing shortly before your migraine came on over the course of several attacks, and see if you can find a consistent trigger. Common ones include:Emotional or physical fatigue due to stress or exertion
Abrupt changes in weather
Altitude
Motion such as from travel
Poor sleep
Missing meals
Certain smells
Hormonal changes, such as in menstruating women
Specific foods and beverages, including aged cheese, chocolate, red wines, coffee, beer, etc. (also, certain food additives such as monosodium glutamate and nitrates)

, Your doctor will be able to provide prescriptions to a wide selection of different medications that have shown efficacy in managing nausea and other migraine symptoms. These medications often require trial and error to discover which combination works best to control your symptoms.


If you are vomiting at least three times a day, you need to see your doctor. Vomiting too much will predispose you to fluid and electrolyte imbalance.
Be sure to see your doctor if you develop a worsening headache. A bleeding blood vessel might be causing the problem.
Visit your doctor if your migraine headache is accompanied by fever, stiff neck, seizures, double vision, numbness, difficulty in speaking, and other unusual manifestations. , Triptans are some of the most common prescription drugs used to treat migraines. They constrict blood vessels and block pain pathways to your brain to alleviate various symptoms of migraines.They are available in various forms—such as pills, nasal sprays, and injections—and the medications include:Sumatriptan (Imitrex)
Rizatriptan (Maxalt)
Almotriptan (Axert)
Naratriptan (Amerge)
Zolmitriptan (Zomig)
Frovatriptan (Frova)
Eletriptan (Relpax)

, To deal directly with the nausea from your migraines, you can also ask your doctor about anti-nausea medications. He or she will likely prescribe one in combination with a drug to treat other symptoms as well. Some common anti-nausea medications include:Chlorpromazine
Metoclopramide (Reglan)
Prochlorperazine (Compro)
Ondansetron (zofran)

Assure them that the pain is not in your head but a real problem.Explain that you would not make up something that disrupts your life as much as this.
You may say, “Though you may not understand it, my pain is very real.”

, Living with chronic pain means that you have to adopt coping strategies. These strategies help you make it through the day even if you are struggling with pain. Because of your coping mechanisms, you may appear happier or healthier than you actually feel.Because of this, the person may think you feel better than you actually do. They may say things like, “You are so happy! Your pain must be better!” Explain to them that you are still in pain, but you are coping and choosing not to be miserable.
You may say, “I choose to laugh and focus on the positive instead of be miserable; however, I still am in a great deal of pain.”

, Many people who talk to people who suffer from chronic pain try to help by suggesting cures, treatments, or medical advice. Most of this is well-meaning advice, but to someone with chronic pain, it’s frustrating. Often, you have probably already tried it or heard about it. Ask the person not to try to help you in this way.You may say, “I know you want to help, and I appreciate it. But please don’t offer medical advice or treatment suggestions. My doctor and I have tried everything that is available to treat my pain.”

Set boundaries.,
Explain that you may not always feel like socializing.,
Ask for support.,
Suggest people visit you.,
Include psychological treatments as part of your care plan.",How to Explain Your Chronic Pain to Others3," Just because you have chronic pain doesn’t meant that you have stopped living. It is important that your friends and family include you in things. Tell the person that you want to be included in their life. You want them to call, visit, and invite you to things.Tell them that you want them to tell you about their lives. Tell them not to be nervous about talking about things they do that you cannot.
Say, “I know I have chronic pain, but I want to be included in your life. I want to see you and talk to you.”

, Having chronic pain doesn’t mean you have become a different person. You are still the same person you were before. You still want to be a partner/spouse, parent, sibling, or friend. Though you may need understanding and to modify parts of your life, ask the person to treat you like the person you are.You may say, “I know I have chronic pain and cannot do what I used to; however, I am still your partner, and want you to treat me that way.”

, When you have chronic pain, you need to help the other person recognize your boundaries. Explain to them that you can only do so much, and there are days you can do more or less than other days. Ask them to respect your boundaries and be understanding.For example, you may be able to walk around one day, but unable to do it another day. You may be in so much pain one day that you can barely talk, but another day your pain may be dull and manageable.
Tell the person, “My level of activity and engagement will vary from day to day. Some days I can do more than others. Please be patient and understanding with me.”

Use ice on the area.,
Apply a warm compress.,
Apply propolis to the affected area.,
Apply aloe to help relieve pain.,
Try taking a lysine supplement.,
Apply olive oil.,
Apply manuka honey on the area.,
Apply oregano oil directly on the area.,
Apply tea tree oil.,
Apply coconut oil.",How to Ease Herpes Pain with Home Remedies1," The simplest way to help relieve herpes pain at home is by using ice. Ice provides immense relief to most types of pain, as it numbs the skin and dulls the pain receptors in the area.Cover the ice pack with a towel so that it doesn't get too cold. Then place the ice pack over the area with the sores.
Cover the ice pack with a fresh towel each time, and wash each towel in hot, soapy water after use in order to prevent further spread of the infection.;
, If cold doesn't help relieve the pain, some people get more relief with hot/warm compresses. Use a clean cotton towel or washcloth folded so that it covers the entire area with the sores. Use water that is at a warm-hot temperature. Soak the towel, wring out excess water, and apply to the painful area.


Use a clean towel or washcloth each time you repeat the process and wash each item in hot soapy water to prevent the possible spread of the infection.

, Propolis is a waxy resin made by bees that has antiviral properties and appears to accelerate the healing of sores.You can use ointments or salves that contain propolis to soothe and help heal the sores.Many health food stores and drugstores carry these products.
Make sure you buy an ointment or salve (not a capsule or tincture) and follow the manufacturer’s instructions.
For propolis and any other topical home remedy, try a small amount on an unaffected area of skin and wait twenty-four hours (to ensure you don't have any allergic reactions) before applying it to the site of your outbreak.

, Aloe gel or an aloe ointment can be used for pain relief.Apply directly onto the sore either by breaking off a bit of an aloe plant and squeezing out the juice or by using a commercial product and following the manufacturer’s instructions.


You can let the aloe gel or ointment dry and later wash off the crust. Reapply every four hours as needed.
Whether directly from an aloe plant or from a commercial bottle, the cooling effect of the gel can help ease pain and promote healing. If you do have the whole plant, take a fresh leaf of aloe vera in your hand. With a knife, cut it into two halves. Apply one of the gelled parts directly on the infected area.

, 1-3 grams of lysine per day may shorten the length of an outbreak.Some studies have indicated that it may be effective at reducing the number of outbreaks of oral herpes sores but should be taken for only about 3-4 weeks at most.Lysine is an amino acid (a protein “building block”) that may increase cholesterol and triglyceride levels, so check with a knowledgeable healthcare professional before taking it.
You can also consume foods rich in lysine, such as fish, chicken, eggs, and potatoes., Olive oil is known for moisturizing the skin. It is rich in antioxidants and is one of the best home remedies for herpes sores. It also contains dinitrochlorobenzene, which plays a vital role in treating herpes infection.Heat a cup of olive oil in a pot with a few sprigs of lavender and some beeswax. After cooling, apply the mixture on the infected area. The beeswax should help keep the oil mixture in place, but you may need to lie down to keep it on the sore.

, Manuka honey has antibacterial and antiviral properties.It can help in the quick healing of herpes blisters and cold sores. All you have to do is to apply the thick honey around the affected region. Apply it several times during the course of the day to make it more effective.


Apply it with cotton swabs or cotton pads directly on your blisters. It can sting you at first, but soon you will feel a numbness on the affected area.
Make sure while applying raw honey to your genitals to lie down to ensure the honey stays directly on the area and doesn't drip off.

, Oregano oil, with its anti-viral properties, helps in the speedy recovery of herpes blisters.You just need to apply some oregano oil directly on the infected area with a cotton swab and let it sit for 10-15 minutes. Then wash off the area and pat dry.


Oregano oil, calendula oil, or jojoba oil can all be applied alone or as a mixture.

, Tea tree oil has been hailed as a veritable cure-all when it comes to any ailment that involves open sores. It is commonly used to treat canker sores and sore throats, and may assist with healing herpes sores outbreaks.Simply use the eye-dropper that comes with the bottle and use a single drop of the oil on the infected area.


Most tea tree oil that is available OTC is concentrated and distilled for maximum potency, so only a small amount is needed for the effects to take place.

, Coconut oil has anti-viral properties against lipid-coated viruses, like the herpes virus, that may help fight the outbreaks of herpes virus that cause sores. It is also an effective skin moisturizer.Although some doctors recommend consuming coconut oil to help boost your immune system, use it sparingly. Coconut oil is about 90% saturated fat, far higher than butter (64%), beef fat (40%), or lard (40%). Studies have not yet shown that its benefits outweigh the potential risk for heart disease that comes with eating too much saturated fat."

Use calamine lotion to soothe genital herpes.,
Soak genital herpes sores in an oatmeal bath.,
Take a salt bath to dry out genital herpes sores.,
Apply a lemon balm ointment.,
Try a combination of sage and Chinese rhubarb.,
Try topical St John’s wort.,
Apply zinc ointment to herpes sores outside of the mouth.",How to Ease Herpes Pain with Home Remedies2," Calamine lotion can help dry out blisters and soothe the skin. Only use it on genital herpes when the lesions are not on mucous tissue—so don’t use calamine lotion on the vagina, vulva, or labia., An oatmeal bath (or even using an oatmeal product such as Aveeno soap) can help reduce the discomfort of the sores. Place about one cup of oatmeal into a nylon sock and place the sock over the tap. Allow very warm water to run through the oatmeal. Soak in the oatmeal bath as long as comfortable.

, Epsom salt contains magnesium sulphate and other essential minerals that are helpful in drying, soothing, and cleansing sores. For this reason, epsom salts are important in relieving the pain and the itching that comes with a herpes infection.To use this remedy:


Warm some bathwater and add around 1/2 cup of epsom salt. Soak for at least twenty minutes.
Always make sure to dry the affected area well after having a warm bath or applying a warm towel. Keeping the area dry will prevent any further itching, irritation, or any possible fungal infection. If a towel irritates your sore skin, use a hair dryer on the cold setting.

, Lemon balm ointments can relieve acute symptoms of HSV infections.Examples of products available are Wise Ways Herbals Lemon Balm salve and Amber’s Organics Lemon Balm ointment. Follow the manufacturer’s directions for the application of your specific product., In one study, a combination of sage with Chinese rhubarb in a cream was as effective as acyclovir (which is a prescription-strength drug used to treat herpes) at healing HSV infections of the female genitalia., Topical St John’s wort is a traditional herb used to treat viral infections. There haven't been any human studies to date using St John’s wort, but lab studies have indicated that the herb can inhibit HSV replication.Examples of products available include like Organic's St John’s wort salve and Bianca Rosa’s St John’s wort salve/ointment.

, Zinc ointments are effective against HSV in lab tests.You can use a 0.3% zinc oxide cream (with glycine). Ask your pharmacist for help in finding these and follow manufacturer’s instructions.

Consider taking antiviral drugs such as zovirax (Acyclovir), famciclovir (Famvir), or valacyclovir (Valtrex) for genital herpes.,
Take an NSAID, like ibuprofen.,
Take acetaminophen alternatively.,
Try a local anesthetic such as lidocaine.",How to Ease Herpes Pain with Home Remedies3," These can be prescribed by your physician. These medications mainly act by inhibiting the DNA polymerase of the herpes virus, preventing its multiplication.These medications are generally given for the first outbreak and to control subsequent outbreaks.Only really severe cases of oral herpes will require these medications.Zovirax is available in many dosage forms, such as tablets, syrups, injections, and as topical creams for the skin and eye. Each form should be used according to the patient’s medical condition and age. Creams can be applied directly to the blisters whether being in the mouth or on the genitals.
Acyclovir, for example, is prescribed as 800 mg 5 times a day for 7-10 days.
Ophthalmic cream is useful in case of herpes keratitis (herpes affecting the eye causing itching and discharge) to be applied once at bedtime.
Tablets and injections are more useful when the systemic route is wanted. In severe cases, tablets are taken twice daily.
The most common side effects with these medications are nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, dizziness and muscle aches.

, Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be taken to reduce the irritation and inflammation at the affected site. They act by blocking the two enzymes responsible for prostaglandin production, COX-I and COX-II. Prostaglandin is involved in the inflammation process and in producing pain. NSAIDs have analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties that can help relieve fever. You can usually relieve pain from a herpes outbreak with over-the-counter NSAIDs.Examples are Cataflam (Diclofenac salt) and Brufen (Ibuprofen) to be taken as tablets, syrups, effervescent sachets, suppositories, or topical creams. A typical adult dose can be one 50 mg cataflam tablet taken twice daily after meals.
NSAIDs have some side effects, mostly gastrointestinal disorders like nausea, vomiting, peptic or gastric ulcers. Patients with renal or hepatic disorders should ask their doctor first before taking these medications.
Take the lowest possible dosage to relieve your pain. Do not take NSAIDs for longer than two weeks without consulting your doctor. Chronic use of NSAIDs is linked to the formation of gastric ulcers and other health conditions., This medication can be taken for the same types of pain as NSAIDs, but has fewer anti-inflammatory properties. That being said, it still has anti-pain and anti-fever effects, relieving some of the symptoms.


Paracetamol is available as Tylenol or Panadol and can be taken as tablets, syrups, or suppositories. A typical adult dose can be two 500mg tablets to be taken up to four times daily after meals.
Take the lowest possible dose to relieve your pain. Acetaminophen overdose can cause liver damage.It may also be linked to kidney disease., A local anesthetic can be applied directly on the blisters especially on the genitals or the rectum to ease the irritation and itch sensation. A common example is Xylocaine (lidocaine) in gel form. It is well absorbed through the mucous membrane to create a numbness at the skin site.


Xylocaine can be applied twice daily.
Wear gloves or use a cotton swab to apply lidocaine to avoid numbing your fingers.

Use echinacea to enhance your immune system.Echinacea is a medicinal plant and has antiviral properties.It is known for enhancing the immune system.,
Try licorice root (Glycyrrhiza glabra).,
Use medicinal variants of seaweed.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Exercise regularly.,
Use relaxation techniques to deal with the stress of living with herpes.",How to Ease Herpes Pain with Home Remedies4," All parts of the echinacea plant, namely flowers, leaves, and roots can be used for treating herpes outbreaks. It can be consumed in the form of tea, juices, or pills.


Echinacea supplements are widely available at most pharmacies, certain grocery stores, and is also available online.
If using echinacea as a tea, drink 3-4 cups a day.
If using it as a supplement, follow the manufacturer’s instructions.
Consult with your doctor before using echinacea if you have tuberculosis, leukemia, diabetes, connective tissue disorders, multiple sclerosis, HIV or AIDS, autoimmune disease, or liver disorders. Echinacea may interfere with these conditions., Licorice root contains glycyrrhizic acid, which has shown therapeutic benefit in the treatment of herpes. High levels of glycyrrhizic acid have actually affected irreversible deactivation of the herpes simplex virus in vitro.It should be noted, however, that prolonged use of licorice may result in the retention of sodium and a loss of potassium, so individuals suffering from heart problems and pregnant women should avoid the intake of licorice.


For the treatment of herpes, the extracts of licorice roots can be effective. Alternatively, intake of two capsules of the extracts of the roots of licorice is equally beneficial.
Talk with your doctor before using licorice root. Glycyrrhizin, the active ingredient in licorice, can cause pseudoaldosteronism, a medical condition that causes headaches, fatigue, high blood pressure, or even heart attacks. People with heart failure or heart disease, kidney or liver disease, high blood pressure, hormone-sensitive cancers, diabetes, low potassium, or erectile dysfunction should not take licorice., Seaweeds such as Pterocladia capillacea, Gymnogongrus griffithsiae, Cryptonemia crenulata, and Nothogenia fastigiata (red seaweeds from South America), Bostrychia montagnei (sea moss), and Gracilaria corticata (a red seaweed from India) can all inhibit HSV infections.These seaweeds can be used as medical food by adding them to salads or stews, or they can be found as supplements.


If you are using it as a supplement, follow the manufacturer’s instructions.

, Keep yourself as healthy as possible by eating well. The healthier you (and your immune system are), the better you will be able to get through the herpes flare up and possibly prevent outbreaks and reduce their severity.The ""Mediterranean diet,"" rich in olive oil and fruits and vegetables, may help boost your immune system and offer protection from some inflammatory disease.Totally avoid processed, packaged and prepared foods.
Only eat whole foods. These are foods that are as close to their natural state as possible. For instance, increase the amounts of fruits and vegetables that you eat. Limit red meat and increase the amounts of (skinless) poultry. Stick with complex carbohydrates, such as those found in whole grains, lentils, beans and in vegetables. Increase the nuts and seeds in your diet, as these contain high levels of minerals, vitamins, and healthy fats.
Avoid processed or added sugar. This includes sugars added to processed foods like high fructose corn syrup. If you need a “sweet hit”, try using Stevia, an herb that can provide 60 times the sweetness of sugar, or eat fruit. In addition, avoid artificial sweeteners.
Increase healthy fats. These are the omega-3 fats found in fish and olive oil.
Drink wine in moderation. Wine is part of the Mediterranean diet and, when consumed in moderation, may help contribute to overall health., Staying well hydrated will help your system to work better, allowing your body to better fight off the herpes outbreak. Drink at least 6-8 (8oz) glasses of water every day, whether you have an outbreak or not.

, Our bodies work best when we exercise. Regular exercise helps keep your immune system in better shape, possibly helping to prevent outbreaks.Start slow by walking more often. Park the car far away, use stairs instead of escalators or elevators, walk the dog, or just plain take a walk! If you want, join a gym and find a fitness coach. Lift weights, do cardiovascular workouts, use an elliptical, whatever you enjoy and will stick with.
Make sure you talk to your physician and make sure you know what you should and shouldn't be doing. Don't push yourself too hard.

, Living with herpes can impact every aspect of your life. Also, stress and tension can trigger an outbreak, so finding ways to relax can be very useful. Try yoga, meditation, exercise, or deep breathing to calm yourself.Stress relief can even be as easy as finding a hobby that you enjoy or taking a relaxing walk in your neighborhood.

Wear loose, cotton clothing.,
Keep clean and hygienic.,
Avoid sexual activity.,
Take care of yourself.",How to Ease Herpes Pain with Home Remedies5," Always wear cotton loose clothes, especially underwear. Cotton is natural and soft, gentle on your skin and doesn't irritate the skin any more than it already is. Cotton will allow your skin to heal and breathe.Other synthetic materials can't absorb any of your sweat and can inflame, trigger and worsen your genital herpes. This goes for all synthetic materials, such as nylon, as well as silk.
Avoid tight clothing, as it will trap sweat and further irritate your skin.

, Make your personal hygiene a priority. Take frequent showers, especially during summer or on hotter days. Change your clothes when you are sweaty or dirty.


Use detergent soaps to wash your affected areas and hands, especially after each bowel movement, after applying your topical creams, after getting in contact with other people, and before eating.

, If you have a herpes outbreak, avoid partaking in any sexual activities to avoid infecting your partner. While you may infect him or her when the virus is dormant, it's much more likely to happen if you have an active infection.Always have protected sex by using condoms to prevent the contact of fluids with any possible cuts in the skin. Any unprotected sexual activity can put those you are with at risk.

, As an outbreak can happen due to stress and sickness, it's incredibly important that you take care of yourself to make the current outbreak go away faster and to prevent future outbreaks. Here's a few things to keep in mind:


Get 7-8 hours of sleep daily. Being fatigued wears down your immune system.
Eat plenty of vegetables and fruits, like apples, cabbage, spinach, beetroot, bananas, papayas, carrots, mangoes, etc. Avoid sugar and junk foods. Drink only in moderation.
Manage your stress levels. Consider taking up yoga or meditation to banish the potentiality of stress causing your next outbreak.

Determine potential causes of a herpes infection.,
Identify causes of an outbreak to prevent future outbreaks.,
Identify what herpes symptoms look like.,
Figure out how HSV functions in the body.,
Get diagnosed when you have an active infection.",How to Ease Herpes Pain with Home Remedies6," Herpes can easily infect a healthy person through direct contact with an infected person, be it from their saliva, skin sore discharge, or through sexual contact. The infected person can infect anyone even if the virus is in “dormant” state, meaning they are currently asymptomatic. Some patients don’t know that they have the virus until experiencing an “outbreak,"" which means having their first sore or a blister, signifying herpes.


The virus present in the saliva can be transferred through sharing personal items, like toothbrushes, dental floss, makeup like lipstick or gloss, used utensils, used towels, or through direct contact like kissing.
HSV-1 causes oral herpes, though some reports mention genital herpes arising from the HSV-1 strain. HSV-2 is generally reserved for genital herpes as semen or vaginal fluid can be the perfect mediums to transmit HSV-2.
Condoms should always be used for anal, oral, or vaginal sex, whether the infected person is asymptomatic or not. That said, even condoms don’t guarantee that you or your partner won’t get infected but they do dramatically lower the risk.
If you have any oral lesions, you should not give oral sex or receive oral sex from someone who has oral lesions without protection.
If a pregnant woman is having a genital herpes outbreak during delivery, the baby has a higher chance of acquiring the infection than if the mother is asymptomatic during delivery., An infected person with herpes will carry the virus within his or her blood stream for the rest of his or her life, but will not have symptoms all the time. However, there are some factors that can trigger the dormant state of HSV to make an outbreak.


Sickness in the body can trigger the virus inside you to be active, causing some of the symptoms to appear.
Stress or fatigue can put a load of tension on your cells, affecting many things in your body.
Any kind of medication that can cause any degree of immunosuppression, like corticosteroids or chemotherapy for cancer, can give HSV a chance to be activated.
Vigorous sexual intercourse can trigger genital herpes.
A woman's menstruation cycle can be a triggering factor, too, perhaps due to the hormonal disturbance, general discomfort, and weakness of the body.

, Symptoms may show up within 2 weeks of infection and can last for 2-3 weeks.Blisters, though the main side effect, aren't the only symptom that accompanies an active herpes infection. Symptoms include: blisters, painful urination, flu-like symptoms, pain in the legs, vaginal discharge, and swollen glands.


In men, herpes blisters emerge on the penis, buttocks, anus, thighs, scrotum, inside the urethra, or inside the penis. In women, they appear on buttocks, cervix, vaginal area, anus and external genitals.They are painful and itchy, especially in the first outbreak
Genital herpes patients can experience painful urination or defecation due to the presence of the irritated blisters around the genitals or rectum. In some case, this will be accompanied by discharge from the vagina or penis.
As HSV is a viral infection, flu-like symptoms can appear in some patients, such as having fever, headache, general weakness, and enlarged lymph nodes.
Swollen glands (lymph nodes). These are usually located in the groin but can also be found along the neck.
Some other causes of genital sores that your doctor may want to rule out are fungal infections (caused by the Candida fungus--candidiasis), Hand-Foot-and-Mouth disease (caused by the Coxsackie A type 16 virus), syphilis (caused by the spirochete, Treponema) and a Herpes zoster (Varicella zoster/ human herpesvirus type 3) infection (the same virus that causes chickenpox and shingles).

, Your immune system will detect the HSV virus when you are infected or when you experience an outbreak. It then starts to develop some antibodies to fight the virus; the lymph nodes swell as a result of producing and overload of more antibodies and the body's temperature elevates to create an undesirable environment for most bacteria and viruses. Once your body gets the virus under control, generally a few days, the symptoms will fade.


However, the immune system can’t get rid of the virus entirely; each person with HSV will continue carrying it. That being said, the antibodies formed will help to prevent the patient from having another outbreak in the future. This remains true through both HSV-1 and HSV-2 and in instances where both are present., HSV-1 and HSV-2 can be diagnosed during an outbreak by examining the sores and taking a sample to be tested in a lab. There are also blood tests that test for antibodies to the virus.Your doctor will ask about your medical profile, about other people you may have shared personal items with, and your marital status. He or she should also ask if you have had any sexual activity with a partner or partners and what sexual safety precautions you take.


The first and most effective test is called a herpes culture. A swab from the fluid or discharge of the sore or blister is taken to exclude any differential diagnosis from any other conditions.
In some cases, other blood tests can be performed in case of absence of blisters. These are supposed to measure the antibodies formed against HSV-1 and HSV-2. However, these tests are not always accurate.Therefore, it's best to go for the culture.

Know the all round effects of pain.,
Reason within yourself.,
Get up and get going.,
Know what matters to you.,
React only if you feel like it.,
Have a defense system.,
Positive aggression.,
Be tactful.,
Be aware that people who pain others for no mistake of theirs have low morals and moral strength.,
Build your morals.,
Be clear.",How to Desensitize Yourself from Emotional Pain," One must know that pain is not only painful; it is, one in a hundred times, helpful too. Usually, though, it is undesirable and simply unwanted. Pain is scientifically said to last not more than a few minutes. It is the one who is suffering who constantly reminds themselves of the past and hence it inflicts more than the real experience itself, over and over again. Pain affects in such a way that it stops you from participating in activities with your usual vigor.


You may feel laid back.
You may not do the things you did before because you are hurt.
You may shut yourself emotionally or physically or both for as long as you feel upset.
Some even get their frustrations out on others who are innocent.;
, Go back to your past and think of all the things you learnt being hurt. There will be quite a few lessons, from being weaker to stronger in many different ways. Why did you not learn those things before being hurt? If you are capable of learning something why not learn it on time? Why did you wait for pain to teach you or to get you learning?


Pain is by itself very deep and hurting but reasoning and understanding the situation is of paramount importance. You will be living and dealing with many such events. And you must stand up and fight for yourself, your loved ones and your interests. To be able to do that and to do justice to yourself, you must not let any pain shun you or suppress you for any longer.

, Be aware of what is happening immediately around you. Because when something happens around you it is expected of you by your relatives, neighbors, and friends to know what it is that happened. If you are asked and you are blank, the blankness gives an impression of ignorance or lack of interest. Although it is also expected of a smart individual to not disclose too much information, it is advisable to be calm and know what the present situation demands in terms of emotional output and alertness.

, Since a conversation is a major deciding factor about an individual's strength and weakness, conversations become the basis of how people treat you. If you know your priorities you could stand by them and defend yourself.

, People could hurt you only when you allow them to step into your space. If you do not allow them and they tease you anyway, they feel unattended and don't feel completely satisfied about hurting you. You seem about alright to them while you continue being the way you were in spite of them mistreating you.


If you sense something brewing, or if you know that someone is about to trouble you, try not to react to their jokes or conversation. Some conversations are not as innocent as they sound in the beginning. It is used as a bait to catch your attention. If it interests you, you may participate in it. Your being hurt depends on your participation.
The more affected you look, the more it gives an impression to them that they won.
The more bored of them and uninterested you would appear to them, the more they will turn to someone else to harass.

, Surround yourself with your emotional strength. This could be done negating or denying to fear any threats. When you deny giving up on any fearful thoughts outright, the fearful thoughts subside. The more you fear, the more you feel weak and helpless. The more you try and make efforts towards being more and more positive and powerful, the more it will help you in being stronger emotionally.


All strength begins in the inside and then it works to the fore!
Your inner strength or 'will' will be the strongest when you have the assurance that you were either right or you didn't do anything wrong intentionally. Those who intentionally hurt others tend to have lesser or no inner strength. They rely on others for much of their strengths.
Pick your defense. It could be

Silence.
Silencing the harasser or the source of your pain by confronting and finishing the conflict.
Having something else like a resourceful activity to divert your mind.
Reminding yourself the reason why you would not fall prey to pain or someone's tricks. It could be that you are greater than them, that you have better things to do like an aim than stay in pain, that you would return back and answer the source of all the agony with your victory to clarify where your stand.



, In order to keep hurtful judgments of people away, you must learn about your major interests. When you know your interests, you will be a little aggressive about protecting them when someone tries to manipulate you. People often, knowingly or unknowingly try to manipulate or hurt you based upon what you have said. Once they know that you walk the talk, they will treat you keeping your strengths and attitude in mind.

, Tact is a strong guard. It works like a scarecrow in farms to keep unwanted elements away from destroying the farm. Being tactful begins with knowing your interests and its application. This means that you give a sharp response to someone trying to take you for a ride. This response of yours is not explicitly disrespectful, but it clarifies to the receiver that you don't take rubbish readily. They will have to bite their tongues for attacking you. Which they will and they will go back unhappily messing with the wrong person. Look smart so people think twice before rubbing you in the wrong way.


The choice of words that a tactful person uses are direct and assertive, such as ""I don't find it funny"", ""Maybe you need a break"", ""I prefer to finish my work right now"", etc.

, Hence, people with morals have an upper hand over harassers. This is because moral strength renders great strength in the middle of a fight, argument or in any difficulty.


The one with strong morals will always have his or her chin up. Their core or belief could never be shaken up by anyone, permanently. At times, some people deliberately try to hurt someone who seems too strong. These strong people seem strong because of a sense of belonging and after doing praiseworthy or good deeds to others.

, Moral strength only grows with time and it works like roots to trees in very painful times. You will feel stronger than others who would be in a similar situation who do not indulge in any good work or charity to the unknown. People with moral strength are almost always in a sane mind and are willing to help. They are not too shocked, too helpless or too vulnerable when people see them. Although they may experience these emotions but no one will be able to get the better of them. One of the most rewarding acts is of giving or helping others.


You could help others without a sacrifice.
Or help by incurring some cost to you.
You may help others by sacrificing any of your wants or by going out of their ways. To each his own!
While all these will technically help others, it will morally build you and strengthen you before you realize it.
What you get in return. You could give while expecting something in return, expecting more in return, expect nothing in return, give while feeling frustrated, or give and feel happy for no reason. Try to give without expecting and allow yourself some time in letting yourself adapt to this attitude.
There is no reason to judge someone who is not helping anyone or those who are receiving your help.

, Be aware that what you owe to do or fulfilling your responsibilities or helping someone is your decision, but these do not ensure freedom from pain by default. Pain should be tackled and it could be lessened with your efforts.


Know the importance of the kind of troubles you face and give only as much importance to it. Overemphasizing painful words or acts is not the best attitude towards it. Let people be left alone with their inputs. They need not be punished or thought of by you.
Whenever a new painful situation arises, you get to exercise your reserve of strength or willpower, or develop stronger guards than before. Completely desensitizing yourself from pain will only deprive you of one of the many emotional experiences you are allowed to feel.

Identify the treatment area.,
Clean the skin.,
Apply oil to the skin.,
Prepare the cups.,
Soak a cotton ball in rubbing alcohol.,
Carefully light the cotton on fire.,
Place the flaming cotton into the cup.,
Quickly apply the cup to the skin.,
Repeat as needed.,
Extinguish the fire.,
Leave the cups in place for 5 to 10 minutes.,
Expect bruising.,
Treat any blisters that form.,
Use sparingly.",How to Do Cupping," Determine where on the body to place the cups. When using cupping to treat pain or soreness, you will need to apply treatment directly to the affected area.


Target the muscle groups involved in and surrounding the entire point of pain.
Note that fleshy areas of the body, like the back, stomach, arms, and legs, are ideal treatment areas.
Do not apply cups over an area where you can feel a pulse. You should also avoid applying cups over an artery, deep vein thrombosis, or ulcer.When using cupping to treat a condition other than chronic pain, like depression or bronchial congestion, you will need to consult with a licensed acupuncturist to determine the best treatment site.;
, Wash the treatment site with soap and water. Dry well using a clean towel.


Consider removing any body hair from the treatment site, as well. The suction created during the procedure can pull on stray hairs and may cause unnecessary pain.

, Smear a small amount of skin cream or oil over the intended treatment site. Rub the product into the skin as thoroughly as possible.


This step is only optional and may be omitted if desired.
Following this step can reduce irritation and may make it easier to move and reposition the cups as needed during treatment.
For best results, use a medicated cream or herbal oil formulated to soothe the skin, such as calendula oil. Avoid products that warm the skin or increase blood flow since cupping already draws blood to the surface of the treated area.

, Wash the glass cups you intend to use with lightly salted warm water. Dry the cups thoroughly.


Thick glass cups work best, but you may also use cups made of plastic, bamboo, iron, or pottery.
You will need cups of at least two different sizes. Half should hold 4 oz (125 ml) and the other half should hold 2 oz (60 ml). Cups with narrowed mouths are also better than those with wide mouths.
Dissolve 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) salt in every 2 cups (500 ml) of water used to clean the cups. Use this solution to scrub the cups thoroughly. Rinse them under running water, then dry well with a clean towel.

, Grab a sterile cotton ball with long medical tweezers. Insert the cotton into a dish of rubbing alcohol, allowing the alcohol to soak all the way through it.Other flammable materials can be used instead of cotton. Common options include paper and dried herbs.
Rub away and drain any excess rubbing alcohol. The material should be well saturated but does not need to be dripping wet.

, Using a lighter or candle, carefully light the cotton on fire. Hold it steady with the same set of tweezers.


Make sure that the bottle of rubbing alcohol has been closed before you light the cotton. An open bottle is a highly dangerous fire hazard.
Keep other flammable materials away from your working area to further reduce the risk of unintended fires or burns.
You must be able to keep the flame controlled throughout the entire process. If the flame grows out of control, completely cover the flaming substance in a non-flammable container to cut off oxygen and kill the fire.

, Insert the burning cotton into the first glass cup. Keep it there for two to five seconds, or until the glass feels notably warm.Do not allow the cup to become too hot. It should be warm to the touch yet still cool enough to handle with your bare hands. Making the cup too hot can result in harmful burns to both you and the person receiving treatment.
If you are using multiple cups, continue holding the cotton with medical tweezers throughout the entire treatment. Do not let go of it until all cups have been applied. If you are only using one cup, you can release the cotton into the glass and allow it to burn out. Empty the glass before applying it to the skin.
The fire burns away some of the oxygen from the inside of the cup. This is important, since retaining too much oxygen will prevent the cup from suctioning to the skin.

, As soon as you remove the burning cotton, invert the glass and place it onto the skin over the target area.


As the glass cools, the space inside transforms into a vacuum. This vacuum creates enough suction to hold the cup in place. It also causes the skin at the opening of the cup to draw upward into the empty space.
Suctioning the skin in this manner opens the pores and stimulates blood flow. Stagnant blood is drawn away while fresh blood is drawn into that area. As new blood is drawn into the tissues of the treatment site, that site receives improved, healing doses of oxygen., Work with one glass at a time. Warm each glass using the burning cotton, then invert the glass and place it on the skin. Continue until all of the glasses have been placed.


For areas with bony joints, use the smaller 2 oz (60 ml) cups.
For broader areas with more flesh, use the larger 4 oz (125 ml) glasses.

, Put out the fire by dropping the lit cotton into a fire-resistant container and covering it with a lid.


In essence, you are smothering the flame and cutting off its supply of oxygen.
Small flames will usually burn out on their own even if kept in an open fire-resistant container, but it is best to extinguish the flame as soon as it is no longer needed, just to be safe. If the flame is small enough, you may even be able to extinguish it by merely blowing it out.

, Keep the cups on the skin for up to 10 minutes, or until the skin beneath them turns begins turning from red to violet. Remove the cups by simply lifting them off with your hands.


Ten minutes is ideal for the treatment of most conditions, but five minutes should still offer some benefit to the patient. Do not keep the cups on for more than 15 minutes, though.
If the suctioning becomes too painful to bear, remove the cups before the full time has elapsed.

, Cupping almost always results in some bruising. In most cases, bruises caused by cupping are relatively painless and will disappear within three to four days without additional treatment.


Note that cupping bruises can last up to a week on some individuals. If the marks do not fade after a week or worsen within that time period, consult a doctor for professional medical advice.
These bruises can actually serve as a diagnostic aid. Marks that are a deeper shade of purple generally indicate greater blood stagnation, and the true source of the patient's pain likely lies just beneath that area. As such, that area is the site where future treatments—cupping or otherwise—should be focused.

, In rare instances, cupping can create mild to moderate blisters. Treat serious or painful blisters by pricking, draining, and disinfecting them.


Disinfect an undamaged needle or straight pin by rubbing it with isopropyl alcohol, then carefully puncture the edge of the blister with the tip of the needle.After puncturing the blister, gently press the fluid toward the hole to drain it.
Apply an antibiotic ointment and a clean bandage over the area after draining it.

, Cupping can be used regularly, but too much can be bad for your health. Use this treatment for no more than 15 minute per target area once or twice a day.You can repeat cupping on a daily basis for as many as 10 days. After the tenth day, wait another day or two before trying the procedure again.

Ice the injury.For medical reasons explained in the next section, this is the first thing you should do after shutting a door on your hand.,
Stay calm.,
Take over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers.,
Focus on your breathing.Deep controlled breathing will help you calm down and lower your heart rate.,
Distract yourself.,
Visualize food.,
Apply ice immediately.The most important step in the aftermath of the injury is to ice your hand as soon as possible.,
Elevate your finger.Point your finger up toward the sky.,
Check where the hand is injured.If the most severe pain is in the palm, or if any of your joints are affected, you should seek expert medical attention as soon as possible.,
Make sure there’s no injury to the nail bed.You can tell if the nail has become partially detached from the nail bed by looking for dark discoloration under the nail.,
Follow the doctor’s instructions on how to drain blood under the nail.Do not attempt to relieve the pressure without first consulting a medical professional.,
Seek medical attention if necessary.",How to Deal With the Pain of a Door Being Shut on Your Finger," But, medical reasons aside, the cold from the ice will numb your hand if you keep it in place for long enough. Although the extreme cold will be uncomfortable or even painful at first, push through it and keep the ice in place. Eventually, you’ll feel less sensation — including pain — in the iced area.;
, Your first impulse might be to panic, but try not to let yourself get overexcited. Excitement can lead to increased blood flow, which in turn might lead to harmful swelling. Furthermore, research has shown that anxiety leads to a heightened experience of pain, though this is more researched with chronic pain than with acute injury.Regardless, staying calm will help you stay focused and manage your pain in the short term.

, Although for severe injury, you should see a doctor who can both treat your hand and prescribe stronger pain relievers, for manageable situations, OTC medications will help you deal with pain. In general, OTC pain relievers are either acetaminophen (Tylenol, Panadol, etc.) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, etc.).


Take all medications as directed. Acetaminophen should be taken every 4-6 hours, and ibuprofen every 6-8 hours.
If you have stomach problems, kidney problems, or are pregnant, don’t take ibuprofen without consulting a doctor.
People with liver disease should not take acetaminophen., Focus on the sensation of the air at every stage in the breathing process — how it feels as it enters through your nose, how it feels when you hold it in your chest, how it feels as it rushes back out through your nose or over your tongue. Think about those feelings, and nothing else.


Inhale slowly and deeply so your belly, rather than your chest, rises first.
When you can’t take in any more air, hold your breath for several seconds.
Exhale slowly and methodically, controlling the release of air rather than letting it all rush out on its own.
When you’ve finished exhaling, pause for a few seconds before repeating the cycle with your next inhalation.
Repeat this process until you feel comfortable releasing your attention.

, To take your mind off the unpleasant pains, try to let your mind wander to other stimuli that engage your senses. You might listen to your favorite album, watch an engaging TV show or movie, have a conversation with someone, or perform a light activity that doesn’t stress your hand, like going for a walk. Research show that engaging your five senses makes your experience of pain more manageable., Research shows that guided imagery, in which a person or audio recording helps a person in pain focus on relaxing mental images, can help ease both chronic and acute pain.However, a recent study suggests that simply visualizing your favorite foods on your own can achieve the same effect without the external aid or guide.Just fantasize about tucking into your favorite foods — whether it’s chocolate or a cheeseburger — in intense detail, imagining how it smells, tastes, and feels. Let those pleasant thoughts take over your mind and the pain will fall away.

, The cold temperature slows down the blood flow to the area, reducing any swelling or inflammation that could make the injury worse. The extreme cold will also numb the area, reducing how much pain your experience, as mentioned above.


If you don’t have ice, any cold object will do. A bag of frozen vegetables from the freezer is just as good as an ice pack.

, Just like with the application of cold, the goal is to decrease the blood flow to the injured area to reduce swelling. As you’re icing your injury, keep both your hand and finger up in the air.

, However, if you closed the door on the tip of the finger and didn’t injure your joints or our nail bed, the doctor may just advise that you rest your hand and wait it out.

, This discoloration indicates that blood is pooling under the nail, and you need to contact a doctor for advice on how to proceed. If it’s just a small amount of blood, the injury might heal on its own. However, large amounts of blood can be painful, and might require action. The doctor may ask you to come in so he or she can release the pressure building up under the nail, or they may direct you to relieve the pressure yourself.


The doctor should drain the hematoma if the collection of blood is less than 24 hours old. If more than 48 hours have passed, the blood has clotted and there is no use for draining. Patients should have a neurovascular examination of the hand. Flexion and extension should be tested in all finger joints.

, However, if a professional gives you to go-ahead, you can drain the nail bed by following his or her directions. Make sure the wash your finger both before and after the procedure.


Heat the tip of a paper clip or thumbtack over fire until it’s red-hot to sterilize it. Hold it with a pair of pliers or protective gloves to protect your hands from the heat.
Touch the hot metal tip to the fingernail, where the blood is pooling. Even without applying too much pressure, the heat will sear a small hole into the nail. In most cases, this will be uncomfortable, but not painful.
Allow the blood to drain out through the hole and relieve your pain.
Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics.

, In many cases, depending on the severity of the injury, you can simply ice the hand and wait for it to heal on its own. However, you should consult a doctor if you observe any of the following:Inability to bend a finger
Injury to a joint or palm bones
Injury to the nail bed
A deep cut
A broken bone
Dirt at the site of the injury that needs to be cleared out to prevent infection
Any sign of infection (redness, swelling, warmth, pus, fever)Failure for the injury to heal or improve

Stretch your hip muscles.",How to Ease Hip Pain," It is really important to know what is causing your pain. See a doctor before you start doing any exercises or taking any medication. There are many reasons your hip could be in pain, including arthritis, bursitis, or an injury you've got while playing a sport. Always ask your doctor what you should and should not be doing, given the cause of your hip pain.;
, Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) are best when soothing hip pain (which is most often caused by inflammation of the joints.) Ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin will both reduce inflammation and alleviate the pain for several hours. NSAIDS block the enzymes that create the chemicals that cause inflammation in the body.If over-the-counter drugs like aspirin don’t seem to be having much of an effect, call your doctor. He or she may prescribe a more powerful pain-relieving medication. You should also always consult your doctor before introducing a new medicine (even one as common as aspirin) into your daily life.

, Holding ice to your hips will reduce inflammation of your joints. You should hold an ice pack to the affected area for 15 minutes several times a day.If you find that the ice pack is uncomfortably cold, wrap it in a towel and then place it on the pained area.

, Heating your joints can soothe the pain you feel. Consider taking a hot bath or shower, or soak in a hot tub if there is one available to you. You could also consider purchasing a hot pad that you can place directly on your hip.


Do not use heat to soothe your joints if you have bursitis. Heat can cause hips affected by bursitis to actually become more inflamed.

, If you have injured your hip, the best thing you can do is to simply give your hip time to heal. Avoid anything that causes you to feel pain in your hip. Instead, grab an ice pack, a bowl of popcorn and watch some movies. You should give your hip a rest for at least 24 to 48 hours., If you are in severe pain, chances are you won’t feel like running or jumping anyway, but it is good to keep in mind that these activities should be avoided. High-impact activities will cause your joints to become more inflamed, thus causing your more pain. Instead of running, try taking a brisk walk, as walking has much less of an impact on your joints.

, The more your body weighs, the more weight your painful hip is burdened with supporting. Losing weight can help ease hip pain simply by removing some of that weight that stresses the cartilage and joints. Learn how to get lose weight here.

, You should buy shoes that give you as much support as possible. Look for shoes that have great cushions, or have removable insoles so that you can add orthopedics. The sole should have good shock absorption, should limit pronation (turning or rotating the foot) and will evenly distribute pressure along the length of your foot., Getting your blood flowing and loosening the joints can make the rest of your day much less painful. This is a particularly good thing to do if you have arthritis. Start your day by activating your hips with a bridge exercise.Lie on your back on the floor with your legs bent. Your feet should be pressed firmly into the floor and should be hip-width apart.
Raise your rear off the floor by pressing down through your ankles. Keep your abs firm and your knees aligned with your ankles. Your body should create a straight line from your shoulders to your knees. You should hold this position for three to five seconds, then slowly lower your rear back down to the floor. Repeat this process 10 times.

, Swimming and aquatic exercises are a great way to strengthen your hips without putting too much pressure on them (as you do when you run.) Consider swimming laps or joining an aquatic aerobics class at your local gym.

, Again, always consult your doctor or physical therapist before you begin an exercise routine meant to ease your hip pain.


Stand straight up with your feet ahead of you. Lift your right leg horizontally as far as is comfortable and return it. Do the same thing with your opposite leg. This exercise stretches your hip abductors.

, Your inner thighs play a large part in supporting your hips. Weak inner thigh muscles can hurt even a healthy hip.


Lie on your back with your arms outstretched away from your body. Pick up a large exercise ball with your legs and lift your legs so they are perpendicular to the ground.
Squeeze the ball using your inner thigh muscles 10 times. Repeat this process for two or three sets of 10 squeezes each.

, Strong outer thighs can be very helpful when you are dealing with hip arthritis as they support some of the weight of your body.Lie on the pain-free side of your body. It helps to lie on a carpet or yoga mat so that you are not just lying on the hard surface of your floor.
Raise the leg which has the hip pain up six inches from the floor. Hold it in the air for two or three seconds, and then lower it back so that it is resting on your other leg (your legs should be parallel with each other and the floor.)
Repeat this process of lifting, holding, and lowering 10 times. If possible, do this on the other side as well, but stop if it is too painful.

, Speak to a physical therapist before you begin a stretching routine. Stretching can help ease hip pain, while also strengthening your hip muscles so that you can avoid future pain.Hip rotation stretch: Lie on your back with your arms by your sides. Bend the leg that you would like to stretch, placing your foot flat on the ground. Keep your other leg straight and on the ground with your toes pointing up. Rotate your bent leg out and away from your body. Do not push your leg any further than is comfortable, and if really begins to hurt, stop stretching it. Hold the stretch for five seconds and then bring your leg back so that your foot is flat on the ground again. Repeat this 10 or 15 times on each side.
Hip flexion stretch: Lie flat on your back. Choose the leg you want to work on and then bend it so that your foot is flat on the ground. Wrap your arms around your bent leg, holding on to the shin area, and pull your leg towards your chest. Only go as far as your body will allow--if it begins to hurt, release your leg. Hold your leg against your chest for five seconds and then release. Repeat this process 10 to 15 times on both sides.
Glute squeezes: Roll a towel into a tight cylinder. Lie on your back with both of your legs bent so that your feet are flat on the ground. Place the towel between your knees. Squeeze your knees together so that you are engaging your buttocks and inner thighs. Hold the squeeze for three to five seconds and then release. Repeat this 10 to 15 times.

Go to the dentist as there might be another cause of your toothache.,
Drink carbonated beverages with a straw so they do not come into contact with your teeth.

,
Rinse your mouth after drinking carbonated beverages.,
Reduce your consumption of carbonated beverages.,
Take a multivitamin daily for their mineral content.,
Let the carbonation seep out of your beverages, for a couple hours, before drinking them.",How to Deal With Toothaches Caused by Carbonated Beverages," Follow your dentist's advice. The base of your lower teeth will tend to hurt, more than other areas, because liquid settles in your lower mouth. Since the teeth nerves are sympathetic your pain could be over a large area. It will be painful if neglected.;
,, The effects of carbonated beverages are immediate and rinsing (or brushing) will not help. Rinsing helps in removing the sugar from the beverages.

, Drink healthier beverages such as fruit juice, vitamin water, electrolyte drinks, water and skim milk instead.


When reducing consumption of a carbonated beverage, drink in its place a combination of beverages.
Read the label of your carbonated beverage and you will notice that it contains various elements: such as acids (carbolic), minerals, calories and trace amounts of protein (beer). Switching to just water could result in an imbalance in your body.

, When choosing a multivitamin, read the labels for their calcium content because calcium builds teeth. The calcium content of multivitamins is usually low, such as 20%, but that extra calcium should be enough to eliminate your toothaches. Read about calcium supplements. Try to include foods, like dark green vegetables, low-fat dairy products and orange juice, that are high in calcium in your diet.

, Cracking open the cover of your beverage, just a bit, is cleaner because if you accidentally knock over beverage it will not spill and make a mess. Enjoy the great flavor of your favorite beverages after letting some the carbonation out. Carbonation adds taste to beverages, and even after letting a carbonated beverage seep in the refrigerator for two or more days, there will still be some carbonation in most beverages.

Know how a pinched nerve is diagnosed.",How to Deal with a Pinched Nerve in Your Hip," PRICE stands for protection, rest, immobilization, compression and elevation. All of these things will help to relieve the pain of a pinched nerve and can easily be done at home.



Protection: Protecting the nerve means avoiding further damage or injury. To protect the hip you should avoid exposing it to heat (from baths, saunas, heat packs etc.) and avoid excessive movement.

Rest: It is recommended to avoid any activities that may cause further injury to the affected area for the first 24 to 72 hours. Try to sit or lie down as much as possible.

Immobilization: A splint and bandages are usually put on the affected area to immobilize it and prevent further injury.

Compression: Make a cold compress by wrapping an ice pack in a damp towel and applying it to the injured area for 15 to 20 minutes every two to three hours each day. The cold helps to numb pain and reduce inflammation.

Elevation: To elevate the hip, place one or two pillows under the hip so that it is elevated above heart level while lying down.This promotes good blood circulation to the injured area and aids in healing.;
, A gentle massage with warm oil will be beneficial in relaxing a pinched nerve. You can ask someone else to perform the hip massage, or make an appointment with a massage therapist.


A good massage uses long, firm strokes and constant pressure to relax the hip muscles, reduce spasms and relieve tension in the nerve. Sometimes gentle vibration is beneficial for relaxing the muscles and nerves.
You will not be able to relieve a pinched nerve with a single massage - a few massage sessions will be necessary to allow the muscle to let go of the pinched nerve, affording you longer-lasting relief.

, This exercise works out and stretches the hip muscles and the muscles in the lower back, therefore relieving rigidity and pressure to the hip.


Sit in a chair with the feet flat on the floor. If the hip pain is on the left side, place your left ankle on top of your right knee. (If the hip pain is on the right side, do the opposite).
Make sure that the ankle bone lies about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) above the kneecap. Allow the right knee to fall out to the side.
Lean forward until you feel a stretch in the left side of the outer hip and lower back. Hold for 10 to 20 seconds.

, This exercise stretches the hip muscles, therefore relieving stiffness and pressure in the hip.


Assume a lunge position. The front foot must be 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 m) in front of the back foot, with both knees bent at a 90 degree angle. The back leg should be the painful leg since it will receive the greatest stretch.
Place your back knee on the ground. Keep your front knee directly over the heel. Keep the body upright and slowly lunge forward until a stretch is felt on the front side of the back thigh Hold position for 10 to 20 seconds, then release.

, Tightness in the outer hip muscles can place pressure on the nerves, leading to pain. This exercise relieves this muscle tightness and helps to ease the pinched nerve.


Assume a standing position. Place the affected leg behind the other leg. Push the affected hip out to the side while leaning sideways towards the opposite side.
Stretch your arm (the one on the same side as the affected hip) over your head and towards the other side in order to extend the stretch.
A good stretch should be felt along the side of the body where pain is experienced. Hold this position for 10 to 20 seconds, then release.

, Stiffness in the gluteal muscles can put pressure on the underlying nerves, leading to pinched nerves and hip pain. This exercise can be used to stretch out these gluteal muscles and relieve nerve tension.


Lie down on the floor with your legs extended. Bend the knee on the side of the affected hip and bring it up towards the chest.
Clasp your fingers below the kneecap and pull the knee closer to the chest and slightly out towards the shoulder. Hold position for 10 to 20 seconds, then release.

, Herbal remedies include lavender, rosemary and thyme essential oils, which are beneficial due to their calming and relaxing properties.


Research has shown that these essential oils have analgesic and anti-spasmodic properties, which allows them to loosen tight nerves and reduce muscle spasms, thus relieving the pain suffered from a squeezed or pinched nerve.
You may apply these essential oils topically as part of a massage. They are particularly effective if you apply them an hour before bed.

, If the pain from a pinched nerve is severe, your doctor may recommend that you take painkillers. You may be advised to take over-the-counter painkillers, or you may be prescribed stronger prescription painkillers.


Painkillers work by blocking and interfering with the pain signals going through the brain. If the pain signal does not reach the brain, then pain cannot be interpreted and felt.
Examples of OTC painkillers include paracetamol and acetaminophen Examples of prescription painkillers include codeine and tramadol.

, NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications) work by blocking specific body chemicals that cause an injured area to become inflamed. Examples of NSAIDs are Ibuprofen, Naproxen and Aspirin.


However, NSAIDs should not be taken in the first 48 hours of injury as they can delay healing. In the first 48 hours, inflammation is one of the body’s compensatory mechanisms to the injury.
NSAIDs can irritate the stomach, so they should always be taken with meals.

, Steroid injections can help to reduce inflammation and swelling, thereby allowing compressed nerves caused by inflammation to heal and recover.


Steroid injections must be prescribed and administered by a doctor. The steroids will either be injected or administered through an IV.

, In some instances, you doctor will recommend that you wear a brace or splint on the affected hip. A brace or splint limits motion and allows the muscles to rest, relieving the pinched nerve and promoting healing.

, If all prior treatment measures fail, surgical intervention may be necessary to alleviate the pressure and compression of the nerves.

, Nerve tissue extends outwards from the brain and spinal cord, and is necessary for sending important messages all through the body. A pinched nerve in the hip happens when there is overstretching or compression in the midsection of the body. Since this area is responsible for numerous bodily movements, any injury to the nerves in the hip can result in a lot of pain and discomfort.

, The most common symptoms of a compressed or pinched nerve include the following:



Numbness or tingling: Irritation may be experienced in the affected area. In severe cases, loss of sensation in the compressed nerve may be felt.

Pain: A throbbing or radiating pain may be felt at the location of the pinched nerve.

“Pins and needles”: Afflicted individuals may suffer from a burning ""pins and needles"" sensation in the compressed nerve.

Weakness: Inability to perform certain activities may be experienced with the advancement of a pinched nerve.

Muscle Wasting: This usually occurs in the later stages of an injury. It’s always best to compare the affected area with the opposite normal area to see if there is any difference in muscle size. If you find that there is a difference, see your physician immediately.

, A pinched nerve is caused by compression or pressure on the nerve as a result of several factors such as:



Repetitive motions: Overuse of certain parts of the body may cause too much pressure on the nerve, causing it to become compressed.

Maintaining one position for an extended amount of time: Keeping the body in a particular pose for an extended period of time can lead to a pinched nerve.

, The chances of acquiring a pinched nerve are increased by the following risk factors:



Heredity: Some individuals are genetically predisposed to developing a pinched nerve.

Obesity: Excess body weight can add pressure to the nerves.

Osteoarthritis: This illness causes bone spurs, which may cause the nerves to be compressed.

Overuse: Repetitive movements of certain parts of the body may increase the likelihood of developing a pinched nerve.

Posture: Additional amount of pressure is placed on the nerves and spine with poor posture.

, A pinched nerve can be properly diagnosed after several procedures recommended by specialists such as:



Electromyography: During the course of the procedure, a thin needle electrode is attached into the muscle to measure its electrical activity during periods of activity (contraction) and rest.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): An MRI is used to determine the presence of nerve root compression. It uses a magnetic field and radio waves to generate a more in-depth image of the body.

Nerve conduction study: Performed to stimulate the nerve with mild electrical impulses through a patch-style electrodes attached to the skin.

Take a break from repetitive tasks.,
Apply ice to your finger.,
Take over-the-counter NSAIDs.,
Try stretching the contracted tendon.,
Get fitted for a finger splint.,
Get a corticosteroid injection.,
Get the finger operated on.,
Treat the underlying infection or allergic reaction.,
Treat the joint dislocation.,
Combat the arthritis.",How to Cure Trigger Finger," In most cases, trigger finger is caused by repetitive gripping of the hand, or flexing of the thumb or forefinger. Those who are farmers, typists, industrial workers or musicians are particularly susceptible because they constantly repeat certain finger and thumb movements. Even smokers can get trigger thumb from repeatedly using their lighters. As such, stop (or limit) the repetitive action that's inflaming your finger if you can and maybe the pain and contracture in your finger will resolve itself.


Explain the situation to your boss and maybe they will give you different tasks to perform at work.
Trigger finger tends to happen most often in people who are between 40 and 60 years of age.Trigger finger is more common in women.;
, The application of ice is an effective treatment for essentially all minor musculoskeletal injuries, including trigger finger.Cold therapy (ice wrapped in a thin towel or frozen gel packs) should be applied to the inflamed tendon (it usually looks like a little bump or nodule in the lower part of your finger or in the palm of your hand, and will be tender to touch) in order to reduce the swelling and pain. Ice should be applied for 10-15 minutes every hour, then reduce the frequency as the pain and swelling subside.


Compressing the ice against your finger / hand with a bandage or elastic support will also help control the inflammation, but don't tie it too tight because complete restriction of blood flow could cause more damage to your finger.

, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin can be short-term solutions to help you deal with any pain or inflammation in your finger. Dosage for adults is usually 200-400 mg, by mouth, every 4-6 hours. Keep in mind that these medications can be hard on your stomach, kidneys and liver, so it's best not to use them for more than 2 weeks at a stretch. You can develop gastritis or ulcers from NSAID overuse.


Signs and symptoms of trigger finger typically include: stiffness (particularly in the morning), a clicking feeling as you move your finger, a tender nodule at the base of the affected finger and difficulty straightening the finger., Stretching the affected finger might reverse the condition, especially if you address the problem during its early stages. Place your affected hand palm down on a table and slowly extend your wrist by putting more weight onto the table -- hold for 30 seconds and repeat 3-5x daily. Alternatively, grab onto your affected finger and slowly extend it while lightly putting pressure on and massaging the inflamed nodule (if you see one).


Soaking your hand in a warm Epsom salt bath for 10-15 minutes prior to stretching may help ease the tension and pain in the affected tendon.Trigger finger more commonly affects the thumb, middle or ring fingers.
More than one finger can be affected at a time and sometimes both hands are involved.
Hand massage by a physical therapist may be best.

, Your doctor may have you wear a finger splint at night to keep the affected finger in an extended position while you sleep, which helps stretch it out. Splint use may be needed for up to 6 weeks.Splinting also helps prevent you from curling your fingers into a fist while you sleep, which can exacerbate trigger finger.


During the day, take the splint off periodically to perform finger stretches or light massages.
Alternatively, you can make your own by buying an aluminum finger splint from a pharmacy and attaching it with water resistant medical tape.

, An injection of steroid medication near or into the tendon's sheath can quickly reduce inflammation and allow normal, unrestricted movement of your finger again. Corticosteroid injection is considered to be the first-line treatment of choice for trigger finger.Typically two injections are needed (3-4 weeks apart) and it's effective in up to 90% of patients with trigger finger.The most common preparations used are prednisolone, dexamethasone and triamcinolone.


Potential complications of corticosteroid injections include infection, bleeding, tendon weakening, local muscle atrophy and nerve irritation / damage.
If corticosteroid injections fail to provide adequate resolution, then surgery should be considered.

, The primary indications for getting a trigger finger surgically repaired is if it doesn't respond to any of your home remedies or splinting and/or steroid injections, or if the finger is severely bent and irreducibly locked.There are two main types of surgery: open trigger finger release surgery and percutaneous trigger finger release surgery.Open surgery involves making a small incision near the base of your affected finger and cutting open the constricted section of tendon sheath. Percutaneous release involves inserting a needle into the tissue around the affected tendon and moving it around in order to break apart the constriction.


Finger surgery is typically done as an outpatient procedure using local anesthesia.
Possible complications from surgery include local infection, allergic reaction to anesthesia, nerve damage and chronic swelling / pain.
The recurrence rate is only about three percent, but surgery may be less successful in diabetics.

, Sometimes a localized infection can either mimic trigger finger or actually cause tendon contraction. If the joints or muscles of your finger become red, warm and significantly inflamed over the course of a few hours or days, then seek immediate medical care because these signs indicate a possible infection or allergic reaction to an insect bite. Treatment consists of incision and drainage, warm saltwater soaks and sometimes oral antibiotics.Bacteria are the most common infections of the hand and usually the result of untreated cuts, puncture wounds or ingrown fingernails.
Allergic reactions to insect bites are relatively common, especially to those of bees, wasps and spiders.

, A dislocated finger joint can sometimes mimic trigger finger because it's also painful and causes the finger to look bent or crooked. Joint dislocations are typically caused by blunt trauma, as opposed to repetitive strain, so they require immediate medical assistance to reset or realign the finger joint. Following realignment, a dislocated finger is treated much the same as trigger finger in terms of rest, anti-inflammatories, ice and splinting.


An X-ray of the hand can readily identify a dislocated or fractured finger.
Other health professionals (aside from your family doctor) who can treat a dislocated finger include osteopaths, chiropractors and physiotherapists.

, Sometimes the cause of an inflamed, contracted finger tendon is due to a bout or flare-up of rheumatoid arthritis or gout.Rheumatoid arthritis is thought to be an autoimmune condition that aggressively attacks the body's joints, and it requires the use of strong prescription anti-inflammatories and immune system suppressors to combat. Gout is an inflammatory condition caused by uric acid crystal deposits in joints (typically in the feet, but also in the hands), which can affect related tendons and lead to contracture.


Rheumatoid arthritis commonly affects the hands / wrists and can grossly disfigure the joints with time.
Your doctor may send you for a blood test to check for markers of rheumatoid arthritis.
To reduce the risk of gout, cut down on purine-rich foods such as organ meats, seafood and beer.

Research the main symptoms of joint pain to create an accurate diagnosis.,
See a doctor only if symptoms are life threatening or severe.,
Identify the causes of joint pain.,
Seek proper diagnosis of your joint pain.,
Consider using joint pain relief and treatment centers.,
Seek serious treatment if medicine isn’t enough.,
Use physical therapy.,
Drop the pounds to alleviate the pressure.,
Do not consume or use alcohol and tobacco.",How to Deal with Joint Pain," There are three components that attach bones to each other. Ligaments, bursae and tendons can all be affected by normal wear and tear, which can lead to joint pain. Common symptoms include mild to severe pain, inflammation and serious infection. Further agitation of severe symptoms can ultimately lead to tumors in joints.Stiffness and inability to move a limb are all common warning flags of arthralgia.,


In some extreme cases, unfortunate accidents can lead to exposed tendons or bones. If any joints have been damaged, or bleeding has occurred, an emergency room visit is necessary. Take action to prevent further advancement of symptoms if any of the above has happened. Doctors may need to take surgical action to assist in healing and rehabilitation.
If any joint inflammation or unusual warmth has occurred, then it is advisable to make a doctor’s appointment for the near future. In the meantime, taking over-the-counter medications such as aspirin or Tylenol are adequate before seeking medical assistance.In some cases this may alleviate symptoms completely and reduce pain. Swelling can also be eased with the help of an ice pack. Doing this a few times a day can be done before seeing a doctor or seeking emergency medical assistance.

, There are multiple causes of joint pain including bone cancers, fibromyalgia and bursitis.Joint pain can be a leading indicator to a more serious problem. Lyme disease, Lupus and osteoporosis show their early symptoms through the onset of joint pain.If you think you could be suffering from one of these ailments, it's wise to consult a family doctor if the indications do not subside.

, While searching the Internet for explanation of symptoms is useful, seeking a professional opinion is an easier and more reliable option. In the case that symptoms do not subside, professional advice can help accurately pinpoint the causes and associated treatments for joint pain.


Keep track of the frequency of joint pain symptoms as well as the intensity of the pain. If it’s sharp or acute, will help the doctor make a more accurate diagnosis.
X-rays or cat scans can also be used in identifying because of joint discomfort. Different angles and multiple views will aid in showing fractures or degenerative joint diseases.
Ultrasounds can provide live images of joints in movement and pinpoint the cause and further rule out perilous diseases.
Current technological advancements have allowed the usage of 3-D imaging in identifying leading causes of joint pain. Magnetic resonance imaging or MRI for short enables doctors to closely examine soft tissue, muscles ligaments and their connecting tendons.

, Milder cases of joint pain can be alleviated with over-the-counter medications. However, these medications, when taken excessively over a period of time, can lead to liver damage or further gastrointestinal complications.Doctors therefore may prescribe stronger medications such as narcotics or sedatives that can have minor side effects.These side effects can include nausea, impairment of mobility and confusion.Injections are a more intrusive form of treatment available from some clinics. Cortisone can be injected into joints and the inflamed area to provide relief.Antidepressant drugs also assist in the blocking of pain receptors, and stimulate the endorphins in the brain., There are other treatments available if powerful medications do not alleviate your pain symptoms. Steroid injections are an extra step that can be taken when medications fail.These injections are made of corticosteroids that ease the inflamed tissue faster than pain medication. This is most effective against osteoarthritis and joint degenerative diseases.Symptoms can be alleviated almost instantly with steroid injections directly in the pain area. Some doctors make use a syringe to extract extra fluid from the joint. Sometimes excess fluid can cause joint discomfort and increase the risk of infection.

, Doctors may also recommend physical therapy in order to alleviate joint pain. Cold and heat therapy can be used to treat persistent joint pain while cultivating a bigger range of motion. Electrical nerve stimulation, or a TENS unit has been shown to alleviate joint discomfort for patients., Another hidden culprit of joint pain and discomfort can be attributed to obesity. Having excessive weight can increase chances of hypertension and add extra stress and pressure to bones and joints.Enlisting a healthy diet and participating in light exercise are cheap and efficient ways of alleviating joint pain. Losing as little as ten pounds can relieve loads of pressure felt on already tense joints.


Some foods can actually make joint pain better or worse and should be noted. Fish oil contains anti-inflammatory fighting Omega 3-fatty acids, which are great for assuaging joint pain.Fried and processed foods should be avoided as they can inhibit the bodies’ natural defenses.Cutting down on these foods has shown decreased cases of inflammation and can prevent disease., Healthy lifestyle choices will help reduce the risk of an emergency room visit. Making the decision to cut out tobacco can reduce the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis by 68%.People who consume large amounts of alcohol are can develop gout and osteoporosis, which can create further complications for joint degenerative diseases.

Understand localized muscle aches and pains.,
Protect the area.,
Rest the muscles and do not engage in any activity that causes pain.,
Ice the area to help reduce swelling and pain.,
Compress the area using an elastic bandage.,
Elevate the area.",How to Cure Muscle Aches1," Localized muscle aches and pains can be the result of overuse injuries, overexertion during exercise or sports, poor posture or muscle use, stress or tension or from minor injuries. For the most part, localized muscle aches and pains can be treated using home care strategies to reduce the inflammation and promote healing.


In the early stages of muscle aches caused by injury remember to use PRICE: Protect, Rest, Ice, Compress, and Elevate.;
, It is important to protect the affected area from further injury or damage until you can be evaluated by a physician if necessary. This can include not using the affected muscles, using crutches to stay off an injured leg, or bracing or splinting the affected limb if you believe that you may have broken a bone., This may include changing your movements at work or taking a break from your usual recreational activities. If you feel any pain when you try to move the affected muscle, stop moving it and keep resting. If the pain is sharp, intense, or does not improve, then call your doctor right away., Immediately after an injury, applying ice will help the blood vessels to narrow and restrict bleeding. Icing the area will also reduce the amount of black and blue bruising that you will experience.Ice the area for 10 to 20 minutes several times a day.
Allow at least 60 minutes between icing to allow the skin and underlying tissues to return to a normal temperature.
Use a pack that conforms to your body, such as a chemical ice pack, bag of frozen peas or reusable ice pack from the pharmacy.
Wrap the ice pack in a towel before using it. Don’t apply the ice pack directly to your skin.

, It also helps to prevent excess accumulation of inflammatory fluid in the tissue, which results in painful swelling. Elastic bandages help to protect the affected muscle from further damage while also providing support to the area. Use an ACE wrap elastic bandage from the pharmacy.Do not wrap the affected area too tightly because it can restrict blood flow to the area, increase pain or discomfort, and increase healing time.
Wrap the painful area tightly enough so that the bandage supports the area while still allowing for movement.
Start by wrapping the area of the body that is furthest from the heart and wrapping in toward the body. For example, if you injured your forearm, then you would want to start wrapping near the wrist and then wrap towards your elbow.
Each time you wrap the bandage around, make sure that you overlap the ACE wrap by ½ of the previous layer. Don’t leave any gaps in the wrapping., It is also important to elevate your injured area to help the body reduce the swelling from the injury. Place the leg or arm that is injured on a pillow or other supported area that is above the level of your heart. Do this several times per day.If possible, elevate the area while you sleep as well by using pillows placed above the level of the heart.

Decide if you have a fracture.,
Determine if you have a ligament injury.,
Check for a meniscus injury.,
Identify a dislocation.",How to Diagnose Knee Pain1," Kneecap fractures are common knee problems. You can fracture your knee just by falling onto your knee hard enough. If you fracture your knee, you may need surgery. Knee fractures are generally serious and take a long time to heal.If you have a fractured knee, you will feel pain in the front of the knee. The front of your knee will usually be swollen, and bruising may also occur.You will not be able to straighten the knee or walk and put pressure on the knee.;
, Ligaments are the tissue that surrounds the joint and connects bones to other bones. People who play sports often injure their ligaments. Torn or stretched ligaments limit the movement of the knee, making it difficult to turn or twist, and your knee may also buckle or give way.Multiple ligaments may be injured at the same time.A stretched ligament is considered a sprain. With a sprain, the knee may swell or bruise, and the knee hurts and is hard to use. If the ligament has torn, there might be bleeding beneath the skin. Sometimes there is no pain because the tear also tears the pain receptors.Typically nerve damage will only occur when a ligament is completely torn.The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) are in the front and back of the knee, respectively.The ACL is responsible for forward movement and the PCL is responsible for backward movement. The ACL is usually injured during a sudden change of direction, and PCL injuries often occur during a direct impact to the front of the knee, such as in a motor vehicle accident.Sports such as soccer, football, basketball, and skiing lead to ACL and PCL injuries.
The medial collateral ligament (MCL) provides stability of the inside of the knee. The lateral collateral ligament (LCL) provides stability of the outside of the knee. These are not as commonly injured as the other ligaments. These generally are injured when you get hit in the knee during sports.

, The meniscus are two pieces of cartilage in the knee that helps absorb impact from the thigh and shin. Knee cartilage injuries are one of the most common knee injuries. Though anyone can tear their cartilage, it is common among athletes. Older people tear their meniscus due to degeneration and thinning of the cartilage.A torn meniscus feels like a pop. You may not feel anything until a few days after the tear.
Immediately, or up to a few days after the tear, you may experience pain, swelling, stiffness, difficulty walking, locking of your knee, your knee being weak and not holding, and a limited range of motion.

, A patella dislocation is when the kneecap is forced out of its normal position. You will see an obvious dislocation of the knee, where the knee looks like it is not in the correct place. The kneecap may pop back into place, though still cause problems.You will feel pain as soon as the patella pops out of place. Your knee will swell at the site. You also may not be able to move the knee or leg, and the area around the dislocation may be bruised.This knee injury is rare. It generally occurs due to major trauma, such as car crashes or a high speed injury. You may also dislocate your knee while doing certain physical activities, such as dance. Young people are at a higher risk for kneecap dislocation.

Stretch before your workout.,
Warm up before you start working out.,
Cool down after your workout.,
Consider taking taurine.,
Follow your workout with a whey protein shake.,
Eat a bowl of cherries.,
Take omega-3 supplements or eat omega-3 rich foods.",How to Cure Muscle Aches2," Stretching before, during or after exercise does not appear to reduce overall muscle soreness or aches following exercise.However, stretching and improved flexibility does reduce the potential for injury which causes aches.Stretch large muscle groups prior to any sporting event or recreational activity as a part of your warmup routine. Stretching can also be done during your cool down period.


Although there is some controversy about how long stretches should be held, 20 to 30 seconds is adequate to stretch the muscle group and improve flexibility.
Gently stretch before each workout and during your cool down period.

, Warm up before exercises to reduce delayed onset muscle soreness in the following day or two. This is especially important before engaging in any new exercises.Warm up using the same muscle groups you’ll be using in your workout. For instance, if you are biking you can bike more slowly for 10 minutes. If you are running you may walk briskly for 5 to 10 minutes prior to your workout. In other words, your warm up can use the same exercise but at a slower pace.


Warming up increases your core body temperature, increases the blood supply to the muscles you’ll be using, and increases the flexibility in your muscles., Cooling down incorporates the same concepts. Use the same muscles you were just working hard, but at a slower pace until your heart slows. However, you can also use walking to cool down from almost any other activity you were doing as well. Use a slower pace to cool down for 3 - 10 minutes, depending upon how quickly your heart rate slows.


Research does not support the idea that cooling down after a hard workout will reduce soreness or muscle aches.But cooling down does have other benefits, such as providing time for your heart rate to go down to a normal level, allowing time for the adrenalin in your blood to reduce to a normal level.

, Take up to 3,000 mg of Taurine a day after a strenuous workout to help alleviate the soreness and aches associated with exercise.Taurine is found in abundance in the human body but can be depleted during exercise. Taking it post-workout can help improve muscle regeneration and healing,thus also reducing delayed onset muscle soreness.


Check with your doctor before incorporating taurine into your supplement regimen, especially if you are taking any prescription medications.

, What you eat after a workout can affect your level of muscle soreness in the following days. Whey protein has been found to decrease muscle soreness when taken within 30 minutes after a workout. A whey protein shake may also help when taken the next day as well., Including tart cherries or cherry extract in your daily diet may help to reduce inflammation, muscle aches, and soreness.Tart cherries have the highest amount of anthocyanins, making them the best food choice for relieving muscle aches and pains. Try eating a bowl of tart cherries after a workout to help decrease delayed onset muscle soreness.

, Omega 3 fatty acids are anti-inflammatory in nature and therefore are great additions to any diet, but they can be especially beneficial after a strenuous workout.You can use Omega-3 supplements or increase the foods you eat which are high in Omega 3 fatty acids. Some of these foods are salmon, trout, herring, sardines, flaxseed and walnuts.

Reduce a fever.,
Consider your medications.,
Check for underlying conditions.,
Address electrolyte imbalances.,
Recognize when you should see a physician for muscle aches.",How to Cure Muscle Aches3," When you get a fever, it is often accompanied by generalized muscle aches and pains.To cure these muscle aches, you must also get rid of the fever. It is also important to note that a fever is your body’s response to infection and other systematic disorders such as autoimmune diseases, cancers, etc. To fight an infection, your immune system goes into high gear to fight off bacteria, viruses, or other invaders.


To reduce a fever, you can take ibuprofen or acetaminophen, based on your age and body weight. However, to cure the muscle aches you must address the source of the infection and therefore the reason for the fever. This may require a visit to your doctor.

, Some medications can cause generalized feelings of achiness over the body as part of the medication’s side effects. These are usually very severe whole-body aches, and can be accompanied by other serious problems, such as liver failure. These medications include ACE inhibitors used to reduce blood pressure and statin drugs used to reduce cholesterol levels.To cure muscle aches caused by a medication, you should speak with your doctor about switching to a different medication.

, Some underlying medical conditions will cause muscle aches, including fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, lupus, and lyme disease.See your doctor to determine if an underlying condition may be causing your muscle aches.


To cure the muscle aches from these conditions you must first treat the underlying medical condition. Without specifically addressing the treatment for the medical condition you cannot effect a change in the muscle pain.

, Electrolyte imbalances can trigger muscle cramps and twitching, which can lead to micro-tears in the muscle, the resulting symptoms include muscle aches and pains.Electrolyte imbalances can result from dehydration and may also be the result of taking electrolyte supplements.Drink when you are thirsty, and if you are doing strenuous activity causing you to sweat, you need to stop at least once every 45 min to get water.
Pay attention to the color of your urine. Your urine should be light yellow in color. If it is darker than this, then that is a sign that you are becoming dehydrated. If your urine is clear, then you are over hydrated.
Electrolyte-rich sports drinks can be good after profuse amounts of sweating or other fluid loss such as diarrhea or vomiting, but they do contain a lot of sugar and therefore their consumption should be moderated in everyday situations.

, Although muscle aches are normally something you can deal with at home, sometimes muscle aches require immediate medical attention.Call your doctor right away if:


Your pain lasts more than 3 months without any apparent cause.
You were injured and have recovered but the muscle aches and pains remain.
You are feeling down and blue, sad or depressed, because of the chronic aches and pains you are experiencing, as this may be a sign of depression.
You can’t sleep because of the pain.
If you have pain in your legs that resolves when you stop exercising.If you have muscle aches and pains after starting a new medication, especially statins, you must call your physician.

Determine if you have a Baker’s cyst.,
Decide if you have bursitis.,
Monitor for tendinitis.,
Check to see if you have arthritis of the knee.",How to Diagnose Knee Pain2," A Baker’s cyst occurs when fluid builds up in the back of the knee. This happens when something is wrong or injured inside the joint. However, this can also occur spontaneously without any trauma. Some people just get them and there is no known explanation. This cyst points to a larger underlying problem, like a torn meniscus, that needs to be found soon because the swelling can cause damage to the knee., Bursitis is inflammation or an injury to the prepatellar bursa. Bursa, a round, fluid-filled structure, help the kneecap move smoothly across other tissues without friction.If the bursa gets inflamed, it can cause surrounding tendons to become inflamed and pinched, resulting in pain.Bursitis can cause stiffness or pain in the knee, as well as tenderness of the knee when touched and pain with movement. Pain is usually worsened by bending the knee and improved with extending the knee.The knee may also be swollen and red.Bursitis can be caused by repetitive motions, like bending or stooping.You can also get it by putting pressure on the joint by kneeling for too long on a hard surface.

, Patellar tendinitis occurs when you do the same motion on your knee, like running or cycling. Patellar tendinitis is when the tendon between your kneecap and shin becomes inflamed.Pain is the main symptom of patellar tendinitis. The pain is located beneath your kneecap, near the place it attaches to your shin.
The pain may surround a workout, either as you begin or after you finish one. Eventually, the pain will make it difficult to stand or take stairs.

, Arthritis of the knee occurs when the knee joint swells. Arthritis generally occurs with age or due to a knee injury. It can make everyday tasks difficult, like standing and sitting, walking, or taking stairs. Pain, swelling, and stiffness are common symptoms of arthritis of the knee.Osteoarthritis (OA) occurs due to age. It can start around age 50, but may affect younger people. OA occurs due to the wear and aging of the cartilage of the knee, which causes less protection for the bones as they rub against one another. Pain may also become worse as you go through your day.Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that will not only affect the knee, but joints over the entire body. RA usually starts affecting people between 50 to 75 years old, it is more common in women, and pain is often worse in the morning and improves with moving throughout the day.Post traumatic arthritis occurs after a knee injury. Sometimes this happens years after the injury. Broken bones, ligament injuries, and meniscal damage can cause this type of arthritis.

Visit your doctor.,
Detail your symptoms.,
Describe your pain.",How to Diagnose Knee Pain3," If you are experiencing extreme knee pain, swelling, limited mobility, discoloration, or other symptoms that interfere with your daily life, you should see a doctor. You should also see a doctor if you know you have injured your knee, like in a sports contact accident or a fall. Getting the correct diagnosis can help treat your pain and heal it.Other reasons to see a doctor include exquisite tenderness, inability to bear weight, a cold extremity, or numbness/tinging.If you don’t get the cause of the pain accurately diagnosed, you will only be treating the symptom and not the cause, so it will not heal.

, When you go to the doctor, you should be as specific with your symptoms as possible. Saying that you have swelling and pain refers to just about every knee problem you could have. Try to give your doctor information about any activities you were doing before the pain started and any other symptoms.Let your doctor know if your knee is locking or making popping noises. Tell the doctor if the kneecap was dislocated but moved back. Include any changes in color or size.
Tell your doctor where on your knee the pain is. The location of the pain can help them come to a diagnosis. Is it inside or outside of your knee? Is it in the center, in the front, or the back? Does it hurt just above or below the knee?
Tell your doctor about any sudden movements that caused knee pain, if you were doing a physical activity recently, or if you have fallen.

, Another way you can help your doctor is by describing your pain. This may take some consideration on your part. Do you consider the pain constant or only when you do certain things? Is the pain a dull ache or a sharp severe pain? Try to be specific because different types of pain can help your doctor narrow the cause.Tell your doctor when you feel the most pain. Tell your doctor if only certain activities cause the pain, or if it starts but gets better when you move certain ways.
Let your doctor know if you have done the RICE method - rest, ice, compression, elevation - and how that affected the pain.

Think about recent trauma.,
Assess your activity level.,
Think about your sleeping habits.,
Consider your footwear.,
Think about heavy items you carry.,
Think about your physical activities.,
Consider the location and type of your pain.,
Consider when you have pain.,
Pay attention to numbness and weakness.,
Notice stiffness.,
Have a physical exam.,
Have blood work done.,
Get an x-ray.,
Get an MRI or CT scan.,
Get a bone scan.,
Get an EMG.",How to Determine the Cause of Lower Back Pain," If your body has recently been subjected to any kind of trauma, this may be the cause of your pain. Particularly if your pain started suddenly following the trauma, you are more likely suffering from an acute injury than from a degenerative condition.Trauma can come in many forms, from having a fall or being involved in a car accident, to working too hard at the gym.
Some acute injuries are minor and may heal on their own, but others are more serious. If your back pain does not begin to subside within a few days, see a doctor to ensure that you do not have an injury that requires medical intervention, like a fracture.
Strains and sprains are the most common exercise-related injuries. They normally heal within a week with no medical intervention.;
, Sitting too much, particularly at a computer, can cause low back pain. While inactivity sometimes causes back conditions that necessitate medical intervention, the cure is often as simple as the cause. If you believe your back pain may be caused by sitting too much, try increasing your activity level to relieve it.Try getting up for frequent walking breaks throughout the day. It’s important to get up from your desk at least once every 60 minutes. You can set reminders on your computer or watch to make sure that you stay on track
If possible, get a standing desk so that you can work without sitting all day.
If you can't move more during the day, try to improve your comfort by using lumbar support pillows or an ergonomically-designed chair.
If increasing your activity doesn't improve your back pain, there may be something more serious going on, so it's a good idea to see your doctor.

, Sleeping the wrong way or on the wrong mattress can cause back pain. If you have bad sleep habits or need a new mattress, your back pain could be easily resolved.Sleeping on your stomach is the worst position for back pain. Try flipping over on your back to see if you can get some relief. You may also want to put a pillow under your knees to see if that helps. You can also try sleeping on your side with a pillow in between your knees. If this does not relieve your back pain right away, don’t give up. You may need to experiment with the pillow height to find the best position for your lower back.
Your mattress should be firm to support your back, but not so firm that you shoulders start to bother you. For most people, a medium-firmness mattress is ideal.

, Supportive shoes are very important for spinal health. If you frequently wear uncomfortable and unsupportive shoes, they may be the cause of your lower back pain.Avoid wearing high heels, as they can cause your spine to be misaligned.
If you wear flats, make sure they have some arch support to them. Flat shoes like flip flops can be just as bad for your back, if not worse, than high heels.

, In some cases, back pain may be caused by carrying heavy items, especially for long periods of time. If you frequently carry heavy bags or other items, try to reduce their weight to see if this improves your condition.Children often experience back pain from carrying backpacks that are too heavy. To avoid this, make sure your child's backpack weighs no more than 20% of his or her body weight.

, Sometimes, back pain can be caused by too much activity, especially if you are not physically fit or if you exercise sporadically.Think about whether your recent physical activities may be contributing to your back pain. For example, sports such as golf can require repetitive twisting motions, which can cause lower back pain.


Running can also produce low back pain. Running on an uneven surface or on a track can also lead to other problems, such as pronated feet, which can disrupt proper muscle movements and cause pain all the way up to the back.

, There are many different kinds of lower back pain. Identifying the precise location of your pain, as well as the type of pain you are experiencing (shooting, burning, sharp, etc.), can help you identify the source of your pain. Spondylolisthesis can cause pain in the low back, buttocks, and legs.If you have sharp pain that is isolated to one side of the lower back, it may be caused by kidney stones.
Sciatica causes pain and tingling in the low back, and usually in one leg and/or foot.
Lumbar disc disease often causes a shooting or tingling pain in the back.Fibromyalgia causes widespread pain in many different areas of the body, including the lower back.Muscular pain from muscle knots can also cause local pain, or pain that radiates into the buttocks or upper thighs.
However, keep in mind that back pain can be a complicated disorder and there are times when the symptoms may not fit the condition. That’s why it is important to have a full evaluation by your healthcare provider who can diagnose your condition and identify the cause of your lower back pain.

, Different low back conditions may cause different positions or activities to be painful. Make note of when your pain began and what kinds of movements aggravate it, as well as what positions alleviate your pain.


If your pain increases with standing, bending backward, and twisting, but decreases with bending forward, the source is likely the facet joints in your spine.If your pain started for no apparent reason and was accompanied by a popping sensation, you are likely suffering from sciatica.If the pain gets worse when you sit down, you may have a herniated lumbar disc.If your pain increases with walking but decreases if you bend forward or sit down, then your pain may be caused by a stenosis, which is when the open spaces in your spine become narrow.Pain that comes and goes throughout the day may be caused by a problem with one of the internal organs, such as the kidney or pancreas., There are many different conditions that may cause numbness or weakness along with lower back pain. If you experience this, pay attention to the location and severity to help identify the cause.Spondylolisthesis can cause weakness in the back and legs.Spinal stenosis can cause weakness when walking.
Sciatica often causes weakness in only one leg.
Infections can cause generalized weakness, along with fever and chills.Cauda equina syndrome, a serious spinal cord injury, can cause numbness between the inner thighs., Some conditions that cause lower back pain may also cause muscles stiffness, which may make it difficult to move. If you have this symptom, it may be a clue that can help in your diagnosis.


Spondylolisthesis can cause stiffness in the lower back.There are several inflammatory joint diseases, such as reactive arthritis, that tend to cause muscle stiffness, especially in younger patients., When you see a doctor for back pain, the doctor will perform a complete physical exam, which will probably include a series of tests designed to help isolate the exact location of your pain. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may administer one or more specially designed tests.


The FABER test is used to diagnose sacroiliac joint disease. Your doctor will rotate your hip externally while you lie on your back. If you experience pain, your symptoms are coming from he sacroiliac joint.The straight-leg test is used to diagnose herniated discs. Your doctor will raise your leg straight in the air while you are lying on your back. If you experience pain during this test, you most likely have a herniated disc.Your doctor may ask you to bend backwards. This test is used to diagnose spinal stenosis, as those suffering from the condition will experience pain when bending backwards., Your doctor will most likely want to run laboratory tests on your blood as well. While this kind of test may seem unusual, it is actually very important. Blood work is done to rule out underlying conditions that may be contributing to your back pain, such as infections., An x-ray is often one of the first tests a doctor will order to help identify the source of a patient's back pain. This test uses radiation to obtain an image of the bones inside the body.X-rays are useful for diagnosing conditions that can be seen in the bones, such as fractures and bone spurs. They are not used for diagnosing conditions related to the soft tissue.
Be aware that an x-ray is just part of what your doctor will use to find a diagnosis for your condition. An x-ray alone will not usually provide answers about your condition. There are many people with degenerative changes on x-rays who do not have any pain. Disc degeneration, facet joint osteoarthritis, or osteophytes are present in nearly 90 percent of people over the age of 64., If your doctor believes that your back pain may be caused by a problem in the body's soft tissue, you will probably be sent for an MRI or a CT scan. Both of these technologies are able to take images of the soft tissue, including ligaments, cartilage, and spinal discs.MRIs and CT scans are useful for diagnosing conditions such as herniated discs, spinal stenosis, and degenerative joint disease. However, your doctor will use your MRI or CT results in combination with your other findings to come to a logical conclusion about your diagnosis. Findings on an MRI should not be cause for concern. Studies have shown that 52 to 81 percent of asymptomatic individuals have evidence of a bulging disc., Although not as common as other imaging technologies, bones scans are sometimes used to take a closer look at your bones. This technology utilizes a small amount of radioactive material that is injected into the patient's body prior to imaging.Bone scans are especially useful for diagnosing tumors, as well as osteoporosis.

, If you have symptoms such as numbness or shooting pain, your doctor may order an EMG. This test measures electrical activity in your body to help diagnose nerve damage or nerve compression.Nerve damage and compression can be caused by many different things, including herniated discs and spinal stenosis. An EMG will not identify the source of the nerve damage, but it will help your doctor understand how the underlying condition is affecting the rest of your body.

An additional procedure may be needed to stop the bleeding.Infections are unlikely but possible, and can be treated with the use of antibiotics.Scarring of the skin tissue at the site of the surgery is possible.;
, Circumcision, or other procedures specific to your condition, may correct the problem for penile conditions.One study showed that 15% to 20% of men that were advised to have a circumcision, and chose to have the frenuloplasty procedure performed, went on to have circumcision done later. The average time to circumcision was 11 months following the initial procedure., Smoking significantly contributes to complications after the procedure.Stop smoking as soon as possible before your procedure. Even just a few days prior to the surgery can have a positive impact on your recovery.The sooner you quit before the procedure, the better the outcomes. Smoking interferes with your body’s ability to heal., Many surgeons prefer to perform this type of surgery with the person under general anesthesia.General anesthesia means you will be asleep during the operation.A spinal block, which is an injection that goes into your back and numbs you from about your waist and below, is also sometimes used.A penile block is sometimes used, although it is not a common way to provide anesthesia for this procedure. A penile block is an injection that numbs only your penis.IV sedation is another option. IV sedation is a type of anesthesia that puts you into a ""twilight"" state. It uses medications that are not as strong as drugs used for general anesthesia, so you will not be as deeply asleep., Since general anesthesia is used in most cases, specific instructions will be provided that you must follow before reporting for your surgery.Common guidelines recommended for people that will be going under general anesthesia include the need to avoid eating or drinking anything, including water and chewing gum, for a predetermined time before your surgery. This step is usually advised to begin at midnight, the night before your surgery., The time you should bathe or shower, and the types of products you should use, will be part of the instructions provided.


Some surgeons prefer that certain types of soaps be used prior to surgery. One example is a skin cleanser called chlorhexidine that helps to clean the skin more thoroughly than regular soap to avoid infections.Your doctor will advise you as to the appropriate products to use in your bath or shower, as well as the time you should do so., As with any surgery, risks are involved. The most common problems that develop from oral frenuloplasty occur very rarely, but include the following:Excessive bleedingInfection at the surgical siteDamage to the tongueDamage to the salivary glandsScarring of tissue at the surgical sitePossible allergic reactions to the anesthesia drugs usedReattachment of the corrected frenulum after the surgery, causing recurrence of the original problem, This type of problem is usually identified at birth, and the corrective surgery is usually done in infants and young children. Your doctor can discuss other options with you, if there are any available.In some situations, the surgery is practically mandatory.When the frenulum is short and thick, and tethers the tip of the tongue to the floor of the mouth, the only option is to proceed with surgery to allow the tongue to move in a normal manner.The condition interferes with the infant or child’s ability to eat, suck from a bottle or breast, speak normally, swallow, as well as causing problems with normal tooth and gum development.Other problems may include difficulty with maintaining good oral hygiene, any activity that involves using the tongue like licking a cone of ice cream or licking the lips, and playing some types of musical instruments., If your child is younger than three months, the procedure may possibly be performed in the doctor’s office.For infants and children older than three months, most doctors recommend general anesthesia., In children, and since the procedure takes only a few minutes, anesthesia done by a method called IV sedation may be appropriate.Your surgeon will advise you regarding the safest form of anesthesia to use in your child. Both general anesthesia and IV sedation have specific instructions that must be followed beginning at least eight hours before the procedure, and often start the night before.Follow the instructions provided by your doctor. The main directions will be regarding restrictions of both food and water for a specified number of hours before the procedure, usually beginning at midnight on the night before the procedure is scheduled.The procedure usually takes less than 15 minutes.Depending on the severity of the condition, a few stitches may be needed., Once you arrive at the hospital or surgical center, you will likely be asked to sign some forms stating you understand the procedure, you consent to have the procedure done, and forms about general hospital policies.You will also be asked some general health questions, including what time you last had something to eat or drink.Questions about any medications you may have taken in the past 24 hours will also be asked, and probably questions about recent smoking and alcohol use., You will be given a certain type of hospital gown to put on, and asked to remove your clothing.Once properly dressed, you will be asked to get on a gurney, or rolling bed, and taken to an area just outside the operating room.At that point, an IV will be started and medication will be administered through the IV to help you to relax, and fall asleep.The actual surgery time is between 15 to 45 minutes in most cases of penile frenuloplasty, and usually less than 15 minutes for oral frenuloplasty., You will wake up in the recovery room, and will have your temperature, blood pressure, breathing, and operation site checked by a nurse.Many people feel nauseous after receiving general anesthesia. If this is the case, let the nurse know and you will be given a medication to help.As you become more alert, you may experience some mild pain. Let the nurse know that as well, and you will be given medication for the pain., As soon as you feel up to it, start taking sips of water.When you are more fully awake, you may have something light to eat and drink as normal., Most people go home on the same day of their surgery.In some cases, an overnight stay may be the safest option. Your surgeon will make that decision.Once you are fully alert and awake from the anesthesia, are able to eat and drink without feeling sick, your wound is not bleeding, and you are able to pass urine normally, you can go home., You may not be permitted to leave the facility unless someone is with you to drive.Because you are mildly under the effects of residual anesthesia in your system, it is not safe for your to operate a moving vehicle.You should not drive for at least 24 hours after surgery, or until your surgeon gives you permission to do so., Let your doctor know if you develop prolonged bleeding or signs of an infection.Check your wound every day. If the discharge from the wound has an odor, or if the area appears to be swollen or reddened, contact your doctor. You may be developing an infection.Also let your surgeon know if you have any difficulty passing urine., It is normal for the surgical site to bleed or ooze a little over the first few days following surgery. The amount of blood or drainage is minimal, but obvious.You may notice small blood stains on your underwear or clothing for a few days following the procedure.
While a dressing on the wound is not needed, if you are uncomfortable with the small amounts of blood or drainage staining your clothes or bedding materials, a small dressing can be used at your discretion.A small dressing, like a 4 x 4 gauze pad, can be lightly taped to the area to absorb any blood or drainage.
Notify your doctor if the wound actively bleeds., An adult should be with you at all times for the first 24 hours after your surgery.Do not lock personal privacy doors, such as the door to the bathroom or bedroom, for the first few days as you recover. The person with you may need to get to you quickly.Rest quietly at home. Recline in a comfortable chair or nap throughout the day in bed.If you feel faint or dizzy, lie down.Do not attempt to be physically active or operate any kind of machinery or heavy appliance for the first few days after your surgery. It may take two to three days to feel your normal energy level return., Drink plenty of fluids, but avoid drinking beverages that contain large amounts of caffeine, such as tea or coffee. Moderate intake is ok.Eat lightly at first. Stick with soup, small meals, and sandwiches for the first few days.Avoid eating greasy, spicy, or heavy foods as this may make you feel sick.Do not drink alcoholic beverages for at least 24 hours after your surgery., If you feel any pain or discomfort, take acetaminophen products, or take the medication prescribed by your surgeon.Only take products your surgeon advised you would be ok.
Always follow the directions on the product label or prescription container. Do not take more than what is recommended or prescribed., If any stitches are visible, do not pull them or cut them.Ask your doctor about the types of stitches used during your procedure.Most stitches used for this type of surgery are dissolvable, and are absorbed by your body in about three weeks. Some surgeons may still use the kind of stitches that require removal by the doctor.The types of stitches used may also require that you wait a few days before you bathe or shower. Ask your surgeon when you can resume your normal bathing or showering routine.
Wear loose fitting clothes to avoid rubbing against your surgical site and causing irritation., Your doctor will advise you on how long to avoid sexual activity.Most surgeons advise to refrain from all sexual activity for three to six weeks, depending on the extent of the surgery.If you wake up with an erection, try to get up, go to the bathroom, or walk around for a few minutes, to prevent the erection from continuing.Do not touch your genital area, other than to shower if allowed and to urinate, for 48 hours after the procedure., You may return to work as soon as you feel able. Most men are able to return to work within a few days. Some more involved procedures may require a longer recovery period, possibly as long as two weeks. Your surgeon will advise you when you can resume your normal daily routine.Allow yourself several days to feel more energetic and more like yourself. It takes time for the lingering effects of the anesthesia to wear off., You can return to your exercise program gradually starting several days after your surgery.Avoid activities that are irritating or put pressure on your penis for a longer period of time. For example, you should not return to bicycling for two weeks.Ask your doctor about returning to specific sports that require tight binding in your groin area, or may be irritating to your penis. Your doctor will guide you in returning to your sport., Once you have waited the appropriate amount of time before engaging in sexual activity, the experience should be pain-free.


If you continue to have pain with an erection or with intercourse, talk with your doctor to discuss the results of the surgery and other options.

, It is normal for the person to experience swelling, pain, and discomfort following the surgery.The discomfort is usually mild and can be managed with over-the-counter medication as advised by your doctor.Be sure your surgeon advises you on the exact products to give your baby or young child to help with any discomfort.
The instructions from your surgeon should be clear on the doses as well as the products that are ok to use.
Do not use more medication than your doctor advised, and do not use any products other than those your doctor recommended.

, If your baby is young and you were having trouble with breastfeeding, try to breastfeed soon after the procedure has been performed.The corrective surgery has immediate results. While there may be some swelling and discomfort, infants are often able to begin to breastfeed as soon as the procedure is completed., If your child is old enough, rinsing the mouth with salt water is often recommended.Your surgeon will provide you with specific instructions on how to minimize the risk of infection, and how to use any recommended products in young children.

, Assist your child with your normal routines of oral hygiene. Normal brushing and rinsing is recommended to keep the mouth area clean and help prevent infection.Avoid touching the surgical site with the toothbrush, or with fingers, in order to minimize irritation and prevent infection.If stitches were used, they were most likely dissolvable.

Stop smoking.,
Get more sleep.,
Exercise regularly.",How to Deal With Unexplained Pains2," Smokers report the greatest level of back pain and disc problems, whereas those who have never smoked report the least.Smoking also contributes to headaches, especially migraines. If you have frequent headaches, you should stop smoking immediately., It’s hard to deal with pain when you aren’t getting enough sleep.People who sleep more hours a night report having less pain sensitivity, meaning they can withstand more pain.It also improves your mood, which may in turn make you think about being in pain less.

, Exercising releases endorphins, the “feel-good” chemicals in the body, which may act like pain killers. They also boost your mood, which can distract you from any pain you feel.Exercising also reduces cytokines, substances in the body that increase inflammation and are associated with nerve pain.Chronic inflammation has been linked to several serious diseases.
People in regular pain might be afraid of moving any more than necessary, but this will make your pain worsen, not lessen.For back pain, you should not rest for more than a couple days.

Relax.,
Meditate for at least 20 minutes a day.,
Try positive self-talk.,
Play a video game.,
Listen to music.,
Laugh more.,
Join a support group.",How to Deal With Unexplained Pains3," Some kinds of pain, particularly back and stomach pain, may worsen with stress and anxiety, causing a vicious cycle of worrying about the pain while the pain gets more intense. Pain can also be caused by, not just exacerbated by, anxiety and stress.The way the body responds to stress is similar to how it responds to pain. Both create faster heartbeat and breathing and make your muscles tense up. Stress causes more cortisol, the stress hormone, to be released into the blood, which can make you more vulnerable to feeling pain.Try out mind-body therapies. These include meditation, guided imagery, hypnosis and biofeedback. The last two require a doctor’s help, but you can do the others on your own., Meditation has been shown to be an effective treatment for chronic pain.There are different ways to meditate, but the objective is to calm your mind and slow down your autonomic processes, like breathing and your heartbeat. You can just sit quietly and try not to think about anything, or use guided imagery to focus your attention on positive ideas.


Lie or sit comfortably and pay attention to your breathing. Don’t try to control it, just notice the pattern and sensation of air going through your body. When thoughts or pain surfaces, think of them like a cloud passing over the sky quickly, acknowledge them, and watch them fade into the distance.For guided imagery, imagine blocking off the pain physically, like putting it behind glass.Or, sit and breathe deeply for at least 10 minutes a day while imagining a tranquil scene. Picture it as completely as you can, with sounds, sights, smells, etc., so you can imagine you are actually there.Use foursquare breathing. Breathe in deeply into your abdomen, inhaling for four seconds, holding for four seconds, and exhaling for four seconds. Hold for a count of four before repeating. Repeat ten times total., This means replacing your negative thoughts with positive ones. Rather than thinking to yourself, “My back is killing me! I can’t do anything today,” correct yourself and think, “I can break down my task into smaller ones and do one thing at a time. I can certainly do at least the first step now, despite the mild pain I feel.” , Gaming has been shown to reduce stress and help with problem solving abilities.It is better to choose a game that is not particularly violent. Both violent and non-violent gamers have reduced stress, but there are competing ideas about whether violent games distort one’s vision of the world around them., This is a form of helping through distraction. People with chronic pain have reported having less pain after listening to music for an hour every day.It doesn’t matter what kind it is, as long as it causes you to relax, not be agitated.
Everyone’s taste in music is different, but generally consonant harmonies are more pleasing to most people (as opposed to clashing tones or chords). If your first choice isn’t relaxing you, try a different musician or type of music.The best pain relief has been associated with music that has a positive message, is lower tempo and low in intensity., Laughing increases oxygen circulation and lowers your blood pressure.It also triggers the body to release endorphins, which act like painkillers.Laughing therefore offers stress relief and promotes happiness, which can help you focus less on your pain. Watch a funny movie or TV show.
Download your favorite comic routine to your phone or iPod.
Call a friend or family member and reminisce about the good times.

, Having unexplained pain can be a lonely, frustrating experience, so it is important for you to maintain and develop your social circles during this time.

Use capsaicin for back or nerve pain.,
Take SAM-e as an anti-inflammatory.,
Try white willow bark.,
Take boswellia.",How to Deal With Unexplained Pains4," You can apply it with a skin cream or patch. This ingredient is found naturally in peppers. It works by stimulating and decreasing the strength of pain signals through a compound that is believed to relay information between nerves and the brain.Use capsaicin cream up to 4 times a day. It may burn or itch the first couple times, but this will decrease and pain relief will increase with continued use.
Make sure to wash your hands after applying and before touching any other areas of the body, especially your eyes.
Also try skin cream made with comfrey extract up to 3 times a day for back pain.Ingesting hot peppers or taking a supplement helps digestion and stomach problems. It may also prevent bacterial infections., If your pain is due to arthritis, joint pain, chronic lower back pain, or fibromyalgia, you can take SAM-e supplements, which are a synthetic version of a chemical naturally found in the body. SAM-e reduces inflammation and is considered an analgesic, like aspirin or ibuprofen.Take up to 1200 mg a day, divided into 3 doses, for the best effect. You may feel relief after a week, but many people need at least a month of taking it to feel significantly better., This herb, which has been called ‘nature’s aspirin,’ is especially helpful for headaches and lower back pain because it helps reduce inflammation.

Visit your doctor.,
Explain the problem.,
Tell them if you have been depressed, as well.,
Get a second opinion.",How to Deal With Unexplained Pains5," Do not just assume there is no good medical reason for your pain. Check with your healthcare provider to rule out possibilities and ask for advice on what to do going forward. S/he will want to do a physical exam and probably run blood tests to make sure your pain isn’t the result of a serious health condition., Be prepared to discuss the following:


Describe your symptoms. Be specific about where the pain is and any other symptoms that seem to accompany this pain. Also be sure to tell her or him when they started.
Does anything make your pain better or worse?
What do you think the cause may be, and what do you expect from them as far as treatment?
Explain how the pain affects your daily life. Are there things you simply cannot do that you really need to do?
If your pain is all-over and interrupting your ability to sleep, ask your doctor if you may have fibromyalgia. Up to 85% of people who suffer from this have disease not been diagnosed, according to estimates. Symptoms include widespread pain and severe fatigue lasting for at least 3 months, coupled with an inability to sleep well. , If no physical explanation can be found, and you have been in long-term pain while also feeling depressed, tell your doctor and get a referral to a mental health professional. Depression can cause all types of physical problems, particularly headaches, stomach and back pain., If your general practitioner doesn’t seem to be taking your concerns seriously, or cannot offer any insight, get a second opinion, preferably from a specialist who deals with your type of pain.

Talk to your doctor before using medication for pain.,
Consider over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers.,
Ask your doctor about prescription painkillers.,
Ask about trigger point injection.,
Take medicine that is prescribed to you.",How to Control Pain1," Your doctor is trained to know which medication is likely to work best for the pain you're experiencing. Your doctor will also know what interactions must be avoided or otherwise handled. Many drugs can interfere with existing health issues. They can also cause severe interactions and complications if used with other medications. Always consult with your healthcare professional before taking any medication for pain.


Be aware that most drugs treat acute pain. Chronic pain is far more complex and, to date, there are no known drugs that ""cure"" chronic pain.;
, Over-the-counter products are divided into two basic groups: paracetamol/acetaminophen-based products and NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). While many of these are safe for temporary aches and pains, you should only use them in accordance with the label directions. Consult with your doctor for long-term medication plans.Talk to the pharmacist and/or your doctor about using over-the-counter medications, especially if you are already taking medications or you have a pre-existing condition. Even OTC pain relievers can cause severe complications for people with health issues such as heart disease, high blood pressure, kidney or liver disease, or internal bleeding.In the US, paracetamol is known as acetaminophen.Paracetamol/acetaminophen can be used to relieve fever, headaches, and other body aches and pains. It does not reduce inflammation. It has fewer side effects than other pain medications and is usually safe for children.NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen. These can be used to relieve fever and pain. They also relieve inflammation and swelling from mild injuries. They are usually not recommended to be taken for more than 10 days. When taken for a long time to manage chronic pain, many NSAIDs can increase your risk of heart attack and stroke.In some countries, the mild opiate codeine is legal for purchase over-the-counter. In many countries, including the US, medicines containing codeine are generally available only by prescription.Be careful not to overdose. For example, an overdose of acetaminophen can cause damage to your liver and even death. Since so many medications, from headache pills to cough syrup, contain acetaminophen, it can be easy to take too much. Read the labels on OTC medications carefully.Do not take several types of pain medications together. They may have negative interactions and could cause damage.Topical pain relievers, such as lotions, creams, and sprays, are also available. These may help relieve pain from arthritis or muscle pain.You may want to look into nutritional supplements, such as glucosamine, which can ease joint pain in those suffering from arthritis., If OTC medications do not adequately manage your pain, you can speak with your doctor about prescription painkillers. It is important to consult with your doctor so that s/he can prescribe a medication that takes into account any pre-existing conditions, your level of health, the type of pain involved, and other factors. Do not attempt to use prescription painkillers unless they have been prescribed specifically for you by your doctor.Common prescriptions for pain may include muscle relaxants, prescription-strength NSAIDs, or opiate painkillers (e.g., codeine, Percocet, Vicodin).
Injections are a possibility for pain relief, such as a local anesthetic, a steroid injection (anti-inflammatory) or a phenol injection (a nerve block/destroyer). Your doctor can help you decide whether this treatment is appropriate for you.
Antidepressants are common and effective treatment for chronic pain, even when depression is not present.Antidepressants may be used to treat pain from arthritis, diabetes, shingles, nerve pain, migraine, back pain, and more., If you have persistent muscle pain, trigger point injection may be helpful. In this treatment, a healthcare provider uses a small needle to inject a substance into a trigger point (a knot of muscle that will not relax). Sometimes this substance is an anesthetic and/or steroid; other times it is a saline solution.This type of treatment can be used to treat fibromyalgia and other chronic muscle pains. It is usually used when other treatments have not worked.
This procedure must be done by a trained healthcare provider. Never attempt it yourself.

, It is important to take any medication prescribed to you for pain relief. This sounds straightforward but in reality, many people either forget or forgo their medication for various reasons. Sometimes, people may believe that the medicine is no longer helping. Other times, people will stop taking a medication when they feel better, even if the prescribed course is not complete. Not taking a medication as prescribed can cause complications and even other health issues.For example, say that you hurt the left side of your back. Without medication to take the pain away, you will unconsciously favor that side. In turn, other muscles will compensate for this favoritism, and even when your back is healed, muscle memory will continue to overuse the right side. An imbalance in your core muscle strength can, in turn, leave you with back problems, leaving you back at square one, and perhaps even worse than before.

Be sure to stretch.,
Work on improving your push-ups.,
Improve your situps.,
Work on your pull-ups.,
Endurance run.,
Swim.,
Apply.",How to Prepare for a Military Physical Screening Test," Stretching is the most important part of exercise. If you do not stretch your muscles you could cause serious damage to them.;
, Your present physical capability will determine how many repetitions (push-ups) you will do in each set (one setting). Push-ups measure your upper body strength and capability.


Be sure that you know how to do a proper push up.

When doing push-ups, make sure you are on a flat surface, and your stomach is facing the floor. The arms, legs, back, and buttocks are straight and do not sag.
Bend your elbows to lower the entire body until the arms, shoulders, and back are aligned.
Push your body weight back up until your arms are straight.

If you cannot complete 10 push-ups without resting in-between sets you should start off doing push-ups on a chair with the arms on the seat. When doing your sets for push-ups it should never be easy. Always challenge yourself to exceed doing what you think you can. Your daily goal for push-ups should be between 200-500+ push-ups, and your set goal should 20-60 push-ups in one setting.





,


Sit-ups will measure your abdominal strength and capability. Having a strong core (abdominal area) is vital to all exercises even push-ups.

To do a proper sit-up lay on a flat surface with your knees bent, and feet 12–18 inches (30.5–45.7 cm) from your buttocks.
Your arms should be crossed and your thumbs at your throat.
Lift your arms ups then down and propel yourself forward. Your elbows should be hit 1–3 inches (2.5–7.6 cm) below your kneecap when you come up, and then lay back with your arms back into the air. Y

Your thumbs NEVER leave your throat. If you cannot complete 10 sit ups or more in on set do crunches instead. A crunch is the same as a sit-up, but only your back and shoulders leave the floor and your elbows never touch your kneecap. Your daily goal for sit-ups should be between 300-800+ sit-ups. Your set goal should 30-80 sit-ups in one setting, but remember to always push yourself.





,


Pull-ups measure your overall upper body strength, including arms, chest, and back. Pull-ups are difficult, and if you have never tried any doing one, it will be a challenge.

Pull-ups should be done on a pull-up bar or a sturdy bar able to support your weight. Your hands should not be much farther than shoulder width, and palms facing away from you.


If it is a short bar bend your knees and cross your legs so you support all of your weight. Pull your weight up and your chin must reach above the bar then all the way down until your arms are straight. If you cannot complete 1-3 pull-ups us resistance bands that are hooked from the bar to your feet so you carry less weight. Your daily goal should be 50-200+ pull-ups, and Your set goal should be 5-10+.

, The endurance run is a measure of your body’s overall ability to run constantly for a period of time. The PST runs vary from 1.25 miles (2.01 km) or more and they are timed. You should run at least for 40+ minutes a day but more is always better. You should sprint short distances about a street block or so 5+ times a day and also time yourself to track your progress. If you cannot run for 40 minutes without stopping pace yourself to run as long as you can then walk briskly for a short period as a small break. Your goal should be to run 1.5 miles (2.4 km) under 11 minutes or less.

, Most branches do not have a timed swim, but swimming is a great exercise for you to try. The timed swims vary from 300–800 yard (274.3–731.5 m) swim in under 12-11 minutes. You should swim for 30+ minutes and swim one lap timed relays. Your goal should be is to swim 40-50 second short lanes and 60-65 long lanes using the breast or sidestroke, and swim 30-40 second short lanes and 40-50 long lanes using a freestyle stroke.

, Incorporating this into a daily workout can take hours, but will pay off in the end. If your branch requires a timed swim make sure to swim at least 3-7 days a week, but if it does not swim just to break up the monotony of your workouts. Always remember to push yourself beyond what you think you can do, and never settle for the minimum. Never slack on your exercise, because if you cheat the exercise you cheat your body.

There are many treatments that make huge claims that aren’t substantiated by scientific research. Before undergoing any complementary, alternative, or “natural” treatment for pain, do your research and consult with your doctor.The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, which is a division of the National Institutes of Health, has a free downloadable eBook about what to consider when thinking about complementary approaches to pain management.Consult with the licensing or certifying board of the practice you’re considering. For example, make sure that your practitioner is licensed and/or certified and that they have adequate training in their field.
“Natural” does not necessarily mean safe. Always consult with your healthcare provider before undergoing any complementary treatment. In many cases, your doctor can help you can combine traditional medicine with complementary approaches for a better effect.
Be suspicious of any treatment that claims to be a “miracle cure” or to treat many conditions at once. These claims are almost always fraudulent., Acupuncture is not a “magic bullet,” but several studies have shown that professional acupuncture can be effective in relieving pain, especially lower back pain.Acupuncture uses very thin needles to stimulate sensitive points on your body. It has long been a part of traditional Chinese medicine, and is now considered a viable pain relief technique by many medical doctors and researchers.It’s important to ask your doctor about alternative treatments, including acupuncture. All of your healthcare providers should work together in managing your pain.Not everyone responds to acupuncture. Its effects are usually visible within a few weeks. If your pain does not improve after a few weeks of acupuncture treatment, it may not work for you.Acupuncture has been shown by several studies to relieve back pain. However, it is often more effective when combined with other treatments, such as pain medication.The National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine is the certifying board for acupuncturists in the United States. They have a database of providers that may be helpful in searching for a reputable professional., TENS, or ""transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation,"" and dorsal column stimulation may help relieve pain.These methods use a little machine that delivers small electrical impulses, stimulating the nerves that carry touch sensations.


Each approach has success with different kinds of pain but not all types. For example, the dorsal column stimulation seems to work best with nerve damage in legs but does little for back pain. Neither machine is a cure, but they may be effective for some people, some of the time, to alleviate pain.

, Several studies have shown that regular massage by a trained massage therapist can reduce pain and disability.Massage can provide fairly quick pain relief, especially for back and shoulder pain.Talk with your doctor about getting a referral for “medical massage.” If you have a specific pain, such as chronic neck pain, your doctor may be able to give you a referral for targeted massage. Some health insurance companies will cover this type of massage but not other types. However, all massage by trained massage therapists has been shown to help relieve pain.
Massage may also help reduce your reliance on pain medication., These methods can be very helpful for pain, especially related to muscle, bone, or joint pain. They can also be helpful for neck or back pain.


An occupational therapist can work with you to learn to redirect pain so that it interferes less with your daily life.Taking your experience into account, the occupational therapist may use visualization, yoga, meditation, and gentle exercises to increase your stamina, strength, and ability to cope with pain.Physical therapy can help you manage pain by teaching strengthening and flexibility exercises, manual therapy, posture awareness, and body mechanics instruction, as well as assisting in discovering the root of your pain., Chiropractors are trained specialists who can manipulate your spinal area to improve your body’s functioning and alignment.It is a common treatment for lower back pain, neck pain, and frequent headaches.This process is sometimes known as “spine manipulation.” It has been shown to be effective for mild to moderate pain.Always have this procedure done by a licensed, trained provider. It is not a good option if you have nerve pain or damage. Consult with your doctor before visiting a chiropractor to make sure it is safe for you., Managing chronic pain with medication can cause your body to become tolerant of those medications. Tolerance requires you to take an ever-increasing dose to experience any relief from the medication. For individuals who suffer from chronic pain, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can be a useful complementary treatment. Performed with a trained therapist or psychologist, CBT focuses on how you respond to experiences.CBT teaches you to identify negative and unhelpful ways of responding to pain and replace them with helpful responses. For example, many studies have shown that ruminating on pain — thinking the same thoughts over and over, like a broken record, e.g., “I’m in so much pain I can’t stand it” — can make you experience pain more severely. CBT will help you challenge those negative thoughts.Unlike medication, you will not develop a tolerance for therapy, and there are minimal side effects.CBT has been demonstrated effective in managing many types of chronic pain, including chronic lower back pain, headaches, arthritis, and fibromyalgia. CBT has also been used to treat pain from cancer.CBT can be a good choice in treating chronic and recurring pain in children and adolescents. Biofeedback training, relaxation training, and parent training can all help children manage chronic pain without the more dangerous side effects of pain medication., Biofeedback training connects your body to a range of electrical sensors. With the help of a trained professional, you learn how to direct your body’s responses to stimuli; for example, you might learn to relax certain muscles or lower your heart rate.Learning how to control your body’s stress responses helps reduce your experience of pain without the undesirable side effects of medication.Biofeedback can be performed by several types of trained practitioners. Physical therapists may use biofeedback to help people regain motion after an injury or trauma. Psychologists, psychiatrists, and psychotherapists may use biofeedback to teach their clients how to control stress responses and reduce anxiety and psychosomatic or psychogenic pain (pain that is related to psychological factors). Dentists, nurses, general practitioner physicians, and other medical professionals may also use biofeedback with patients.Biofeedback has been shown to be helpful in treating pain from irritable bowel syndrome, migraine, tension headaches, Raynaud’s disease, and back pain.Ask your doctor whether biofeedback could be helpful for you. Most biofeedback therapists will want you to have had a thorough physical examination before trying biofeedback training to ensure that you do not have any health issues that require medical intervention.You can find a directory of clinical biofeedback practitioners via the Association for Applied psychophysiology and Biofeedback., Some jurisdictions have legalized the use of marijuana for medical purposes, or even in general. Marijuana can help alleviate some types of pain, especially general chronic pain. It is important to consult with your doctor before using marijuana so that you understand its benefits and risks and make sure you know the legal status in your state. Some people should not use marijuana, as it can interfere with pre-existing health conditions.Medical marijuana has been shown to be effective for treating some nerve pain, such as that caused by HIV or MS.Marijuana is natural, but it also has risks. It may irritate asthma or allergies. It may also cause dizziness, increased risk of bleeding, or low blood pressure. Marijuana may be addictive.Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not use marijuana. Teens who suffer from chronic pain should not use marijuana, as it may cause psychosis, impaired reactions, and poor concentration., You'll need a trained therapist for this approach and you need to be amenable to being hypnotized. Hypnosis for pain relief works by implanting suggestions that can take your mind off the pain. However, it tends to be short-lived, so it may not be the best long-term solution. It also tends to be expensive, so it's not for everyone. Ask your doctor for a referral if you're interested.Hypnosis can be a helpful treatment for chronic pain. It may work by altering how your mind responds to pain., Meditation can help to soothe and minimize pain.There are several types of meditation, but one that is commonly recommended for pain is mindful meditation. This type can actually change how your brain responds to stimuli.You can also try transcendental meditation, where you focus on repeating a single mantra.Ask your doctor whether there are any practitioners who are certified in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)."

Get social.",How to Control Pain3," Because emotional and physical pain are strongly linked, making yourself comfortable and using soothing techniques may help relieve your pain.Many studies have shown that a placebo is often as effective as medical treatment. This may be because of your expectations: if you expect a treatment to work, it may be more likely to. This is why things like chicken soup can actually help you feel better.Think of the things that caused you to feel better when you were sick as a child. There may be certain foods and drinks that you link with comfort, love and the easing of pain.

, For some types of pain, feeling too hot or too cold can exacerbate the feelings of pain. Keeping warm by adding a blanket, a sweater, a hot water bottle or taking a hot bath might help in some cases. Or, if you're feeling too hot, having a cool shower, going for a swim, sitting by a fan, putting a wet cloth on your forehead, etc., might be ways to alleviate the pain.


A heating pad can be useful for the neck, back, and other strain-type pains.
An ice pack is useful for sprains, scratches, bruises, and cuts.

, Find a room or area that is away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and simply sit or lie down for a while on your own. Relaxing is a way to reduce your stress, which can aggravate pain.The American Chronic Pain Association has a short five-minute relaxation exercise that can help you control pain. You can find it here: theacpa.org/Relaxation-Guide


, If clothing is constricting or pressing on a painful area of your body, you won't feel relaxed and the pressure being applied can intensify the pain. Find clothes that do not constrict the area of pain, even if this means wearing a larger size for a time. If you don't have comfortable clothing, you can get some from second-hand stores, thrift stores, etc.; you don't need to spend a lot for comfort.

, There are various ways in which breathing can both control the pain and help keep you relaxed. Controlled breathing (the kind practiced by yogis and athletes) can assist with pain relief. This helps you to relax and focus, often making the pain easier to handle.Some examples of this include:


Inhale from the stomach, slowly filling yourself with air up to the collarbones. Then exhale from the stomach, repeating the same process in reverse. Make sure your exhalations are longer than your inhalations. Try to inhale to the count of four and exhale to six or, if you can, eight. As you continue breathing, try to make your inhalations and exhalations longer.
Try inhaling for four seconds, then exhale for six. Then hold with empty lungs and repeat this procedure. This should help you to calm yourself and also distract you a little from the pain.

, Distraction is all about doing something else, to take your mind off the pain. It is often recommended by medical professionals to help control pain.Different things work for different people, so you may need to try a range of things until you find something that helps you tolerate ongoing pain., Acute pain that feels unbearable requires fast distraction methods. Distraction won't remove the pain, but it might provide you with the strength needed to handle it until its severity subsides. Creating minor pain and irritation can help to divert your mind's attention to major pain. Some quick distraction techniques include:Stroking, rubbing or vibrating the skin above or around the painful area.
Massaging the painful area.
Clutching an ice cube in your hand or holding to a part of your body to provide an alternative shock of pain to distract from the real pain.
Clapping your hands together tightly to change the focus to your hands; clap harder to create minor, temporary pain in the hand area to distract from the real pain.
Gripping onto something such as a pole, a stuffed toy, a chair back, etc.
Swearing or cursing can help reduce pain., Research has shown that active distractions (ones that require you to do something) are more effective than passive distractions (e.g., TV) in controlling pain. If your pain is acting up, try playing a game, doing a puzzle, or doing some other activity that gets you involved., This is useful for distracting and clearing the mind. Imagery works especially well when combined with pain medications.Try imagining the pain to be smaller. For example, if it's a headache, then decide if the left or right side hurts worse. Does the front of that side or the back of that side hurt worse? The upper of that side or the lower? And so forth. This can help to minimize the pain by making it seem smaller.
Try picturing a beautiful, relaxing place in your mind. Then, imagine that the pain is an object that you can remove from that place. For example, your pain might be a rock that you throw far out into the ocean., Music can relieve stress and anxiety. Stress and anxiety often make our experience of physical pain worse. Listening to calm, relaxing music can help you control emotional and physical pain.Classical music and other music that has approximately 70 beats per minute is best for relaxing you and relieving pain. You should avoid listening to music that is too fast or driving, as it could actually make you feel more pain.Relax in your favorite chair or resting spot. Ensure that you are as comfortable as you can be (taking the type of pain you're suffering into account), and then listen to the music for a good half hour or so.

, Find people who care about you and spend time in their company. Sometimes pain is amplified by feeling lonely and left out. Studies have shown that emotional and physical pain use the same brain pathways.If you have good friends or supportive family members around whom you feel good and energized, this can be a great way to distract yourself from the pain, and to restore your sense of being connected and cared for.

Consider your workplace, home study or sitting areas in your home.,
Consider losing weight to reduce pain.,
Manage your stressors.",How to Control Pain4," The way you sit and the length of time you sit for can be a major source of pain. If you have neck, head, shoulder, torso, upper and/or lower back, leg or arm pain and you sit a great deal, consider whether that pain is either caused by or exacerbated by the sitting and lack of regular movement.Ensure that the ergonomics of your desk and chair have been professionally assessed and adjusted for your height and work style. Also make sure that your computer is at the right level for your height.
Take regular breaks when working on computers, machinery, reading and other tasks that have you seated and locked into a single position for long periods of time. The human body wasn't made for inactivity, and getting up and moving about regularly can give your body the break it needs.
If you perform any sort of repetitive activity, find ways to vary how you sit, stand or move. If you don't, pain will be fairly inevitable result and, in some cases, may prove to be permanent.
Some people find it helps to use a standing or a treadmill desk to ensure that they stay active while working with a computer or digital device.

, If you are overweight, the extra pounds increase the load you put on your joints and can lead to osteoarthritis pain as well as inflammation.Making changes to your diet and engaging in even light exercise (like walking in a pool or lifting two pound weights) helps reduce the strain on your body and can significantly reduce your pain.Though it may seem counterintuitive to exercise when your body is in pain, it can lead to serious pain reduction in the long-term. Start with small, easy exercises and slowly build up your strength. Talk to you doctor about getting started and which kinds of exercise would be appropriate for you.
Evaluate your diet and make sure you're eating a balanced, healthy range of nutrient-rich foods. Talk to your doctor or a nutritionist about getting on the right track.

, What stresses you? It is important to ask yourself that question and identify sources of stress in your life. Once you are clear on the triggers, you can start to find ways to either reduce or avoid these, which in turn, will help to remove sources of pain aggravation. Stressors that can amplify pain include unhealthy eating, smoking, lack of sleep, lack of exercise, inappropriate environment, procrastination and being around ""toxic"" people.Eat foods that give you the best nutritional returns. While chocolate, pastries, fries and the like are tempting when you feel bad, they provide little to no nutritional value and lessen the ability of your body to heal itself. Stick to foods that are nutritionally dense; you might even like to spend some time researching on foods that are thought to heal the body.
Get adequate rest. Being tired on top of feeling pain will always exacerbate the pain. Your body needs regular, adequate sleep rest to run its standard restoration processes. Admittedly, it can be a vicious cycle; pain prevents sleep, sleep lessens, pain increases. If this is happening to you, get advice from your doctor.
Get sufficient exercise. Exercise, including a good long and steady walk around your neighborhood, is an ideal way for relieving stress and ridding yourself of the pent-up anxiety that can hamper sleep.
Check your work or home environment. An environment can come with its own stressors, depending on your sensitivity. For example, a lot of noise, a lack of privacy and crowded space can be sources of stress if you are constantly facing them and find them hard to deal with. Consider how you can reduce your exposure to such forms of stress, such as wearing headphones, shifting to a quieter space or getting outside often.
Try to avoid procrastinating. By getting your tasks, chores, work, etc. done on time, you remove a source of stress.
Find ways to work around or remove other sources of stress in your life that amplify the pain. Hate peak hour traffic? Rearrange your travel time to be outside of peak hours. Does networking cause you break out into a sweat and induce a migraine? Pinpoint one person worth talking to, talk to that person, then allow yourself to go for a walk outside until the next part of the event. Do family gatherings drive you to the point of despair? Smile a lot and simply say, ""No thank you,"" or, ""Pleased to know that,"" instead of engaging in arguments and one-upmanship; save yourself the emotional exacerbation that can heighten pain.

Rest the injured or damaged part.,
Know when to get physical.,
Do stretches.,
Consider tai chi or yoga.",How to Control Pain5," If you have hurt yourself during sport, physical activity or other actions, it is important to rest the area that is injured so that it has a chance to heal. For example, if you hurt a leg, keeping off that leg until it is stronger may be important for healing. However, don't become completely inactive, as movement is usually a key part of recovery. Discuss finding the perfect balance with your doctor.Remember that pain is a warning. If it hurts too much to use the harmed area during recovery, do not push it. The pain indicates that healing is still in process. If you need to push past the pain signals for that part of your body to rebuild strength, only do this under the supervision of a qualified health professional, such as a physical therapist.

, For those with muscle strains or sprains, the best remedy is generally the RICE model (rest, ice, compression, and elevation).If you've taken a fall on hard ground or your back is stiff, however, exercise can often be more beneficial than resting. Mild, low-impact exercise can relieve some types of chronic pain.Exercise that relieves anxiety will often relieve pain as well since anxiety can increase your perception of pain.

, In some cases, gentle stretching can help to alleviate the pain, such as back pain. It is a good idea to see a physiotherapist or similar professional who can advise you which exercises will benefit the area and relieve the pain.


Be aware that doing the wrong exercises, exercising in the wrong way or stretching too much can make the pain worse. It could also lead to re-injury. If you aren't sure that the stretches are good ones to do, don't do them until you have proper advice.
Yoga and pilates are often a gentle way to stretch and relieve pain. Always use qualified instructors and be sure that your doctor or physical therapist has agreed to the exercise first., Several studies have shown that tai chi and yoga can help relieve pain.Some of this may be due to increased strength and flexibility developed by these exercises. The emphasis on mindfulness and meditation in these practices may also help you manage pain.Tai Chi is a gentle Chinese martial art that incorporates meditation and fluid movements. Many gyms and community centers offer tai chi classes.If you are pregnant, have joint problems, fractures, or hernias, consult your doctor before starting tai chi or yoga."
"
Be focused in your efforts to overcome your chronic or ongoing pain.,
Keep a journal or diary.,
Be gentle on yourself.",How to Control Pain6," It is a process, a journey. It is likely that some moments, times or days, the pain will overwhelm you, while other days you will feel more in control. Understanding that the struggle is likely to be ongoing can help you to be more accepting of the pain overall, allowing you to start learning to live with it.Patience can be hard at times, yet pain often teaches people patience, especially for those who are used to doing everything and doing it quickly. Pain slows people down; there is a need to take things more slowly during healing and recovery. Unfortunately, this is often at odds with the fast-paced world in which we live, which can amplify pain if you pretend that you can cope when you can't. Realize that busyness will never go away. Allow yourself the time to recuperate and renew your strength. Going back to activities before you heal usually results in greater damage, not a medal.

, Writing down your feelings and emotions can be both cathartic and revealing. You don't have to share any of what you write with anyone, so you can write down whatever you need to express. Reading back over the journal can reveal patterns of times when the pain is worse than other times, allowing you to pinpoint actions or omissions that will help you to reduce the pain.Use your writing to explore your thinking. How many negative thoughts are you experiencing? Is your thinking often negative or do you experience peaks and troughs of such thoughts? While it is important to let your negative thoughts surface so that they can be experienced, it is equally important to let go of them once you've acknowledged their presence. Writing them down can help you to work through them, then release them, and this can help to alleviate pain too, as you stop feeling so confused or bogged in negativity.

, It is frequent to hear people dismiss pain in an attempt to ""act tough,"" ""not be a wimp"" or ""tough it out."" Pain is a very personal experience and there is no way that one person can assume that another's person pain isn't real, severe or debilitating. While each person suffering pain can seek and make use of methods that might relieve the pain, the reality is that some pain cannot be easily treated and some pain, no matter what is done, does not go away. Do not judge yourself or allow others to judge you.Read all you can about your type of pain. Learn what others have to say about it and have done about it. Borrow the techniques and solutions that you think will work for you and see what happens (of course, keep it safe and sensible).
Some people may dismiss pain as being “all in your head.” As researchers learn more about the relationship between your mind and your body, there is increasing evidence that shows that pain being “all in your head” doesn’t mean it isn’t also real.Realize that depression and anxiety are bed-mates of those suffering chronic pain. They need treating too, so be sure to seek help. Asking for help from a therapist is a sign of strength and courage, not of weakness. You may find that if you can deal with these conditions, the pain experience will lessen somewhat as your perception changes. Finding hope in your life is vital to pain recovery.

Understand what brings about pain in your body.,
Differentiate between acute and chronic pain.,
Understand how you can manipulate your body’s pain responses.,
Note that both physical and emotional pain are real.,
Identify the source of the pain.,
Learn how to describe pain.",How to Control Pain7," Targeting pain relief as best you can requires a basic understanding of what pain is and how it is felt within your body and mind. In a nutshell, pain signals that there is danger, distress or damage, triggering a need to protect the area harmed. Pain is also a way of letting a damaged area heal. Sending out pain signals during the repair process allows your body to alert you that you need to take extra care of that part of your body.Physical pain is signaled through nociceptors (pain receptors) throughout your body. The signals can be activated by cutting, tearing, inflammation, irritation, heat, or other painful stimuli. These pain receptors send signals via the myelinated (sheathed) nerves to the an area of the spinal cord called the dorsal horn. The dorsal horn “decides” whether to dampen or amplify these signals before sending them to the brain.Nociceptors (pain receptors) are found in most of the body's tissues and there are more of them in sensitive zones.Pain is felt in the brain; this is why ""referred pain"" is possible, when one part of the body experiences the pain even though another part of the body is injured.The brain’s role also helps explain why we may experience pain even after our injuries have healed. The brain may continue to send “protective pain” signals without a clear cause.Pain signals from the head and face area go directly to the brain stem. Pain signals from these areas may go to the thalamus, a “relay station” that sends a variety of sense signals to different areas of your brain., Pain comes in two forms: acute and chronic. Acute pain is immediate pain from an injury, disease or damage. For example, if you break your ankle, the pain from that injury is acute pain: it has a clear and immediate cause and should dissipate as the injury heals. Chronic pain is ongoing and often embedded in a long-lasting injury or damage.Pain is considered to have become chronic when it has continued more than three to six months after the damage, or persists beyond the standard healing time expected for the injury in question.Chronic pain is often considered by medical professionals as a disease in itself, much like diabetes or asthma.Chronic pain often involves psychological aspects as well as physiological aspects. Emotional responses such as anxiety, anger and fear can exacerbate chronic pain. Treating it can be complex and difficult.Three common types of chronic pain are: low back pain, headache or migraine, and neck pain.Fibromyalgia is a common diagnosis for sufferers of some chronic pain and/or fatigue. Scientists do not yet know what causes fibromyalgia. Possible culprits include physical or emotional trauma, differing brain responses to pain, sleep disturbances or infection. Fibromyalgia most commonly affects women between the ages of 20 and 50., There are several theories about how your body processes pain responses.One widely influential theory of pain is the Gate Control theory. First proposed in the 1960s, this theory suggests that pain is like an open gate that can be “closed” by non-painful input. Essentially, your brain becomes confused because it is getting two messages at once: “pain=danger” and “touch or vibration=not a threat.” This confusion may keep your brain from processing as much of the pain response.For example, if you hit your thumb with a hammer, your first response may be to suck on it or shake it. The gate control theory explains this response because the non-painful response may suppress the pain sensation that is coming from your central nervous system.
The periaqueductal grey (PAG) area of your brain is also involved in regulating pain. This area operates through a process known as Stimulation-produced analgesia or SPA.Stimulation of the PAG inhibits neurons in your spine, causing them to modulate (i.e., reduce) your pain at the spinal cord before it travels back to your brain.
Conflicting messages can stimulate or “turn on” cells in the PAG. When opiates called endorphins are released, these stimulated cells, which have receptors for those endorphins, receive them and reduce your pain. This process may help explain why acupuncture can be effective in pain management.
Some drugs (for example, morphine) bind to the same receptors as endorphins (the body's natural pain-killers)., “Hurt feelings” are more than an expression; they’re scientific fact. Research has shown that emotional pain stimulates the same areas of your brain as physical pain.Do not feel ashamed of feeling emotional or physical pain. Because pain is such a personal, subjective experience, managing or coping with that pain is too. Don’t let anyone dictate how you “ought” to cope with your pain.


For example, one study showed that feeling excluded from a social activity activated the brain’s anterior cingulate cortex in participants. This area is also activated during physical pain.Another study showed that a breakup can actively hurt. When participants were shown a photograph of an ex as they thought about the breakup, the same areas in their brain and body — the secondary somatosensory cortex and dorsal posterior insula — activated that are responsible for physical pain.How you feel and think about pain can have a huge impact on how you continue to feel the pain. Your thoughts about it can increase or decrease the pain-blocking messages from your brain. The more anxious, negative, or depressed you're feeling, the greater the pain is likely to feel. Getting psychological help, such as therapy, can help you manage physical pain as well as emotional pain., In order to manage pain effectively, you have to know what is causing it. While there is a lot of information available to you, that information can also make you worry excessively or misdiagnose your pain.Consulting with your doctor will help you get a proper diagnosis and understand how to treat your pain. There are several categories of pain that can help you narrow down what may be causing your pain:Neuropathic. This kind of pain is caused by damage to the nervous system. This type of pain often causes symptoms such as:

burning or tingling
numbness with the pain
stabbing pain



Radicular. This pain is caused by compression or irritation of nerves in your neck and spine. You may experience shooting pains that radiate down your arm or leg.

Somatic. This pain is what we often associate with “pain.” It happens when pain receptors in your body, either on its surface or in musculoskeletal tissues, are stimulated.

Myofascial. Myofascial pain is a subtype of somatic pain that refers specifically to muscles. This pain can involve a single muscle or a muscle group.

Visceral. This pain is related to your guts (viscera): heart, lungs, bladder, and other internal organs. This type of pain can feel very vague or nonspecific; you may not know where the pain is originating, you just know that you hurt.
Not all causes of pain can be identified. It is important to keep talking to your doctor, specialist and/or psychologist about what to do when you continue to feel pain but no identifiable cause can be found, or appropriate solution given. Be as tenacious as the pain is, to try to unearth what is really behind the pain.

, In most cases, doctors will rely on your description of your pain to help them understand how to treat you. In addition to examinations and tests, your doctor will likely interview you about your pain. This is called taking a “pain history.” The more specific you can be, the better your doctor will be able to help you manage your pain.For example, doctors may ask whether your pain is sharp or dull, constant or intermittent, burning or aching. Other things about your pain to consider include:Whether the pain is concentrated in one area or is spread all over.
When you feel the pain is most severe.
What activities or movements make the pain worse or better.
How the pain affects your activities and daily life.


There are many terms that can help you describe how your pain feels. Thinking about words to describe your pain may help you communicate how you’re feeling to your healthcare provider. Possible descriptive words include:sharp, stabbing, splitting, shooting
gnawing, aching, heavy, exhausting
throbbing, hot, burning
cramping, punishing, tender, sore

Keep your appointment.",How to Perform a Testicular Self Exam," In order to perform your self-exam accurately, know what to look for in the event cancer may be present. This self-exam is designed to check for the following symptoms:

A lump within the testicle. The lump does not have to be large or painful warrant a doctor visit as tumors can begin as small as a pea or a grain of rice.Testicular Enlargement. This can be of one or both testicles.Note that it is normal for one testicle to hang slightly lower than the other and to be slightly larger than the other. However, if one testicle is larger than the other or has an abnormal shape or hardness, consult a doctor.Changes in density or texture. Has one testicle become abnormally firm or lumpy? Healthy testicles are completely smooth all over. Note that the testicles are connected to the vas deferens via a small, soft tube at the top called the epididymis. If you feel this while inspecting your testicles, don't be alarmed; this is normal.;
, Find a room where you won't be disturbed and make sure to have a reasonable-sized, (hands-free, if available) mirror. A bathroom mirror or full length mirror can work well. Being able to visually observe an abnormality of the scrotum is an important aspect of the exam and will require removing any clothing currently covering your lower body, including undergarments.

, Stand in front of the mirror and examine the skin of the scrotum. Are any lumps visible? Is swelling present? Is there discoloration or anything else that seems out of the ordinary? Be sure to examine all sides of the scrotum, including the back.

, Continue to stand and hold the scrotum in both hands with your fingertips touching, making a kind of basket with your fingers. Hold a teste between your thumb and index finger on the same hand. Press gently to check the density and texture of the teste, then gently roll the teste between your thumb and first finger. Do the same to the other teste using the alternate hand.Take your time. Make sure to thoroughly check the entire surface of each testicle.

, In addition to performing a monthly self exam, schedule a physical exam with their doctor at least once a year. Your doctor will perform a testicular exam in addition to other exams and tests used to determine your overall health. If you are experiencing symptoms, however, do not wait for your scheduled exam date; contact a doctor right away for an appointment., Early prevention is crucial to the successful treatment of cancer. Being aware of your risk profile can make you responsive to symptoms if and when they occur. Below is list of known risk factors to be aware of:


Family history of testicular cancer.
An undescended testicle (also called cryptorchidism). Three out of four cases of testicular cancer occur in an individual with an undescended testicle.Intratubular Germ Cell Neoplasia (IGCN). Often called ""carcinoma in situ"" (CIS), IGCN occurs when cancer cells manifest in germ cells within the seminiferous tubules where these cells are formed. IGCN and CIS is uniform precursors to cancerous tumors of the testes and, in 90% of cases, is found in tissues surrounding a tumor.Ethnicity. Studies in the US have shown that Caucasian men are more likely to get testicular cancer than other groups. Previous Diagnosis. If you have had and recovered from a prior testicular cancer diagnosis, you are at increased risk that the other testicle will be affected., Studies have shown that managing environmental risks like diet and exercise, as well as refraining from the consumption of cigarettes and alcohol, can help prevent carcinogenesis, the process by which healthy cells turn into cancerous ones. , If you are at risk for testicular cancer, clinical trials are currently underway to broaden the variety of preventative therapies; however, available proactive drug regimens like chemoprevention have been shown to prevent the growth and/or re-occurrence of cancer. Your doctor will know if this is option is right for you., During a testicular exam, if you encounter a lump, swelling, soreness, unusual hardness, or any other warning sign, get in touch with your doctor right away. Though these symptoms may not confirm the presence of testicular cancer, it is very important to have a thorough examination to know for sure.


Mention your symptoms when making a doctor's appointment. This increases the likelihood that your doctor will see you promptly.

, If you notice any other symptoms affecting either your testicles or any other part of your body, write up a list. Record even those symptoms that do not seem consistent with testicular cancer symptoms. The extra information may help your doctor as he/she makes a diagnosis and and designs a suitable treatment plan. some of these symptoms may include:Heaviness, or an aching sensation in the lower abdomen or scrotum.
Pain in the lower back, unassociated with stiffness or injury.
Swelling of the breasts (rare).
Infertility. In rare cases, an individual may experience no other symptoms except infertility.

, Once you've made your doctor's appointment, relax. Remind yourself that 95% of cases are completely curable, and early detection increases that rate to 99%.Additionally, know that your symptoms may signal other, less serious causes, including:A cyst in the epididymis (the tube at the top of the testicle) called a spermatocele.
An enlarged testicular blood vessel called a varicocele.
A fluid buildup in the testicular membrane called a hydrocele.
A tear or opening in the abdominal muscle called a hernia.

, When you meet with a doctor, he or she will perform the same kind of testicular exam as you did to check for the problems you felt. You will be asked for any additional symptoms. The doctor may examine other parts of your body, like your stomach or groin, to check for the spread of cancer. If he/she feels anything out of the ordinary, additional tests will confirm a diagnosis.to determine whether there is a tumor.

Consider avoiding muscle relaxants.,
Identify antihypertensive drugs that may cause incontinence.",How to Prevent Male Incontinence1," Many of the underlying causes of incontinence unfortunately cannot be controlled. Benign prostatic hypertrophy, neurological disorders, stroke, prostate/bladder cancer, etc. cannot be prevented. However, you can take steps to minimize your risk of some of these underlying conditions.;
, One excellent way to reduce your risk of developing incontinence is to stop smoking. The National Institutes of health reports that up to 50% of bladder cancer cases are caused by smoking. Pressure in the bladder caused by tumors results in incontinence. If you need help quitting, schedule an appointment with your doctor, who can help you quit. There are prescribed medications to help you, and she can also help you find a local support group., When you are overweight, extra pressure gets placed on your bladder. This extra pressure on your bladder can lead to incontinence. While losing weight may seem like a daunting task, it will be well worth it in the end. Start exercising more and make an effort to eat healthy foods. Other ways you can lose weight include:Making sure that you get the right amount of protein, fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, and healthy carbohydrates each day. Your daily intake of each food group will depend on your weight, age, and health. If you should be consuming 2,000 calories a day, you should eat six to eight servings of grains, four to five servings of veggies, four to five servings of fruit, 3 – 6 ounces of protein, two to three servings of low-fat dairy, and two to three servings of fats and oils.Developing an exercise routine and sticking to it. Your exercise routine should include cardiovascular training (like running or swimming), weight training (like doing push-ups or lifting weights), and flexibility training (like yoga or stretching).
Limiting the portions of each meal you have.
Choosing low-calorie snacks like fruits and vegetables.

, Research has indicated that men with prostate cancer had 62 – 75% decreased zinc in malignant prostate cells and that zinc plays a role in the progression of prostate cells to malignancy. The recommendation is for zinc supplementation, but amounts are not clear at present. Consult your doctor regarding a healthy amount of zinc supplementation based on the present zinc levels in your diet., Lycopenes are powerful phytonutrients and antioxidants shown to fight cancer. Five of the foods highest in lycopenes per cup include:Guava: 8587 uq
Watermelon: 6889 uq
Tomatoes: 7298 uq
Papaya: 2651 uq
Grapefruit: 2611uq

, Some recent findings have suggested that the isoflavones in soy may help prevent prostate cancer.You can increase the amount of soy in your diet with edamame, soy milk, or tofu.

, Omega-3 fatty acids are present in a wide array of fish and seafood options, including salmon, mackerel, sardines, and bass. Studies have shown that omega-3's protect against cancers of the breast, colon, and prostate., Drink at least eight glasses of water during the day to prevent conditions such as urinary tract infection, constipation, and kidney stones that cause incontinence. You should also consider drinking most of your fluids during the day and limiting the amount of fluids you drink in the evening before going to bed.

, If you are afraid that you may develop incontinence, you can train your bladder to some degree. Plan particular times during the day to visit the restroom. This is a way to train your bladder, which helps to avoid incontinence.

, Substances that can lead to incontinence include alcohol, caffeine, acidic foods, spicy foods, and sugar or artificial sweetener.Alcohol is a diuretic, an agent that causes your body to lose fluid. It also irritates the bladder, causing incontinence. Try to limit your alcohol intake to one glass per night if at all.
Caffeine is also a diuretic. Drink caffeinated beverages early in the day if at all.

, Kegel exercises are a great way to prevent incontinence because they strengthen the muscles of your pelvic floor. Learning how to do them correctly can be a little tricky because you have to isolate your pelvic muscles. Your pelvic muscles are the muscles you use when you try to stop urinating midstream. You will see or feel your testicles rising when you squeeze your pelvic muscles.Once you’ve isolated your pelvic muscles, squeeze them and hold for a count of five and then relax for a count of five. Your goal is to do ten repetitions, three times a day., A diuretic is a medication that gets rid of extra fluid in the body. This is usually prescribed for patients who have heart conditions. Sadly, it also has a tendency to cause incontinence. There are several different kinds of diuretics: thiazide, loop, potassium-sparing, and quinazoline diuretics. Recognizable diuretic medications include:


Thiazide diuretics: Clorpres, Tenoretic, Thalitone, Capozide, Dyazide, Hyzaar, Lopressor HCT, Maxzide, and Prinzide.
Loop diuretics: Lasix and Demadex.
Potassium-sparing diuretics: Aldactazide, Aldactone, Dyazide, and Maxzide.
Quinazoline diuretics: Zaroxolyn
Always consult your doctor before taking yourself off a prescribed medication.

, A muscle relaxant is a medication prescribed for certain types of injuries to muscles. It may not come as too much of a surprise that the medications that relax your body also cause incontinence. Recognizable muscle relaxants include:Valium, Soma, Flexeril, Skelaxin, and Robaxin.
Sedatives can also cause incontinence.

, An antihypertensive drug is a medication used to lower blood pressure. Antihypertensive drugs can be a combination of different kinds of diuretics. If you are using an antihypertensive drug, ask your doctor about other medications available that do not list incontinence as a side effect. Recognizable antihypertensive drugs include:Moduretic, Minizide, Monopril HCT, and Accuretic.

You can find Foley catheters at medical supplies stores, online, or through your doctor.Pediatric patients and adult males with congenitally small urethras will not tolerate catheters this large. They may need a 10 fr or smaller.
If you have an obstruction, it's best to call a professional. You will be using a three-way irrigation large catheter to deal with the obstruction, and it's important to know how to insert it without pushing against the obstruction, which is difficult for someone who isn't properly trained. This process isn't recommended for self-catheterization.
Some catheters come in a kit, with the catheter and antiseptic solution that you can pour on the catheter to sterilize it. You should follow the procedures on the kit to make sure the catheter is sterile before you use it. Check the expiration date of kits when they arrive to make sure they are still useable.
While using your catheter will be difficult at first, it will get easier and more routine over time.
If you have any questions, you can consult a nurse who is trained to deal with incontinence.;
, Most catheters are single use because they need to be sterile. They will come in individual packages, making it easy for you to use them and then throw them away.

Some catheters can be cleaned with soap and water. Discuss this with your doctor before trying to wash your catheters.

, You will need the lubricating jelly to make the top of the catheter slick. This will make it easier to insert the catheter into your penis.The lubricant for catheters should be sterile. It should not come in a multi-dose packaging (such as a jar), as once opened it must be thrown away not used again in the future. Use single-dose packets only.


Make sure the lubricating jelly is water-based, as this will less irritating to your urinary tract.

, You will need a container or a urine bag ready to collect the urine once it comes out of the catheter. You can use a small, deep plastic container or a bag designed to collect urine.

, You will also need a thick bath towel to place underneath you to catch any urine or water during the insertion. If you have access to a waterproof pad that you can sit on, this will work as well., Always use medical gloves whether this is an in-and-out cath or an indwelling catheter. Your hands must be clean and protected during the the insertion process. You can find medical gloves at a medical supply store or online.Urinary retention already places individuals at risk for UTI and then shoving a non sterile instrument up the urethra practically ensures a UTI will occur. Sterile gloves and technique preferred.

, You should start by washing your hands well with warm water and soap. Then put on your gloves before you unwrap the catheter.Make sure your hands are clean and the area around you is clean before you take out the catheter from the package. You may also choose an area in your home that is open and free of obstructions, like the floor of your bathroom. Make sure the floor is clean.
It is important to have clean hands before you put your gloves on, as handling the gloves with dirty hands will result in unsterile gloves.

, You will need to sit down with your legs bent. Place the bath towel or the waterproof pad underneath your penis once you are seated. You should have easy access to your penis with your hands.You may also decide to stand in front of the toilet if it is comfortable for you to reach down and hold your penis. You could then point the end of the catheter into the toilet so it drains into the toilet directly.

, Wash your penis with warm water, soap, and a washcloth. Clean the area in circular motions. If you are not circumcised, pull back the foreskin and wash your penis well.Make sure you wash the head of your penis and the urinary meatus, which is the small opening where your urine comes out.
Once you are done, rinse and dry your penis well. Then, place the container you are using to collect the urine next to your thigh so it is easy to access.

, Hold the top section of the catheter and put lubricating jelly on the catheter. You want to cover the first seven to ten inches (18 cm to 25 cm) of the catheter with the jelly. This will make the insertion less uncomfortable., Use your non-dominant hand to hold your penis so it straight out in front of your body. Your penis should be at an angle of 60 to 90 degrees. Hold the catheter in your dominate hand and slowly insert in into the urinary meatus, or the small opening on the top of your penis.Put the catheter around seven to ten inches (18 cm to 25 cm) into your penis using a gentle, pushing motion. Once urine starts to flow through the catheter, you can push the catheter up one inch (2.54 cm) more and keep it in place until you are done urinating.
Make sure the other end of the catheter is positioned in a container or in the toilet so the urine can be collected and disposed of properly.

, Some catheters have a collection bag that you need to inflate with a sterile needle once the catheter has been inserted. You should use a sterile syringe to inflate the collection bag with 10 ml of sterile water. The volume of water needed to fill the bag may vary depending on the size of the catheter you are using so you should always check the packaging on the catheter for the exact volume.You should then attach the collection bag to the catheter so it can hold the urine as you urinate. The inflated balloon should rest on the urethral opening of your bladder so the urine can be collected properly.

, You should always remove the catheter as soon as you are done urinating, as leaving the catheter in can cause urinary tract issues. To remove the catheter, pinch the top closed with your dominant hand and slowly pull out the catheter. Keep the end of the catheter facing upward so no urine drips or dribbles out.If there is a collection bag, you should remove the bag and dispose of it properly in the garbage.
You can then pull your foreskin down if you are not circumcised to protect your penis.
Remove and throw away your medical gloves. Wash your hands well.

, If the catheter is reusable according to the manufacturer's instructions, you should wash it with soap and warm water after every use. You should also sterilize it in a pan of boiling water for 20 minutes to prevent infection and let it dry on a paper towel. Store the catheter in a clean plastic bag.If the catheter is single-use only, you should throw it away and use a new one. You should also throw away any catheters that appear torn, hardened, or cracked.
Depending on your doctor’s recommendations, you may need to use the catheter at least four times a day to ensure you are urinating regularly.

, You may find that no urine comes out of the catheter when you insert it. You can try rotating the catheter slowly to remove any blockage. You may also try pushing it one inch further into your penis or pull it back slightly.You should also make sure the catheter opening is not blocked by the lubricant or mucus. You may need to remove it to determine this.
If no urine comes out even after you rotate it, you can try coughing to encourage urine to flow.

, You may find it painful or uncomfortable to insert the catheter, especially when you are trying to push it past your prostate. You may need to put more lubricant on the catheter to make it easier to insert.Take a deep breath in and try to relax as you push the catheter in to make it easier to insert. If it is still difficult, do not force it. You may want to wait an hour and try again, focusing on staying relaxed and calm as you insert it in.

, If you cannot urinate even with the assistance of the catheter, or you are experiencing other urination issues, like blood or mucus in your urine, you should see your doctor.You should also see your doctor if you develop stomach cramps, your urine appears cloudy, smelly, or discolored, or you feel feverish. You may have a urinary issue that needs to be addressed before you can try using the catheter again.

, You can still have sex if you need to use a catheter. If you plan to engage in sexual intercourse, it's a good idea to catheterize beforehand to remove any urine that is present in your bladder. Always remove the catheter before having intercourse. If the urine is strong or offensive, don't have sex until you can get treatment for a possible infection."

Look into herbal remedies.",How to Know if You Have Epididymitis," This is the most common sign of epididymitis. Pain may start in one testicle and then slowly expand to both testicles over time. Pain is usually localized to the underside of the testicle early in inflammation and may slowly spread to encompass the whole testicle, or even both testicles.


The type of pain differs depending on how long the epididymis has been inflamed; it may be a sharp or burning pain.
Pain is a complex process that is the result of increased blood flow, immune system components, and nerve sensitivity as a result of damage during infection.;
, Again, this may be only on one side or on both sides over time. Some men will find sitting uncomfortable because of the swelling in the testicle.


The testicle will also appear red because of the increased blood flow to the area, and become swollen because more fluid is leaking into the infected area. The testicle may feel warm to the touch as well, and this is also because of the increase in blood flow. These symptoms will likely appear within three or four hours from the initial signs of infection.

, There are many symptoms of epididymitis that men will notice while they are urinating. These may include:


A burning pain while urinating
Feeling the need to urinate more frequently than usual
Blood in the urine

Most men who get epididymitis from an infection have an infection that starts in the urethra and then moves up the tube, eventually infecting the epididymus. Any infection in the urinary tract can irritate the bladder, making it overactive or damaging the lining.



, You will start to feel pain when urinating, as the inflammation grows, expanding to the surrounding tissues. In severe cases, blood will appear in your urine, because of the small hemorrhage that occurs inside the tubes that the urine passes through on its way out. This is, quite obviously, not a comfortable feeling.

, Sometimes, a clear, white or yellowish discharge may appear at the tip of your penis due to the inflammation and infection of the urinary tract. This is especially true if your infection is due to an STI.

, As the inflammation and infection spread throughout the body, fever will occur in your body as a defense mechanism. This is an indication of chronic and not acute epididymitis.


Fever is your body telling you it is fighting off infection. Anything over 100°F (38°C) should tell you you need to visit the doctor immediately.

, Epididymitis is most common in young, sexually active men with many sexual partners. Other groups, however, are at risk as well:


Men who ride motorcycles or who sit for prolonged periods of time (for instance, at sedentary jobs) are also at a higher risk of developing this problem.
Low immunity is an issue, too. Immunocompromised patients, like the ones infected with the HIV virus are vulnerable to infection and inflammation.
In men older that 35 or boys younger than 18, E. coli is a common cause of epididymitis (as opposed to STIs).

, Any surgical procedure, or instrumentation of the urethra, like the insertion of a urethral catheter, can cause inflammation. This can spread to the nearby areas, including the epididymis. This inflammation, in turn, sometimes causes epididymitis.

, The urinary tract can suffer from congenital abnormalities, making the area itself and the surrounding tissues prone to inflammation or infection. Any slight size or position abnormalities can cause rise to problems such as these.

, An active infection of the urinary tract will cause the tissues around it to become inflamed. This includes the epididymis as well. A recent UTI provides a perfect breeding ground for epididymitis.

, Prostatitis is a condition in which the prostate gland becomes inflamed. The inflammation can spread to the ejaculatory duct and then to the epididymitis, causing epididymitis.


In the case of orchitis, the patient is suffering from the inflammation of one of the testicles. Like in the previous cases, the inflammation can spread to the nearby tissues, including the epididymis.

, Epididymitis is treated based on the cause of the inflammation. As most cases are caused by some form of infection, a quick visit to your doctor will probably render you a prescription for an antibiotic. The type and dose of antibiotic depends on if the infection is sexually transmitted or from another source.


For gonorrhea and chlamydia infections, treatment will consist of a single dose of ceftriaxone 100mg as a shot intramuscularly, followed by 100mg doxycycline as a pill twice a day for 10 days.
In some cases, the doxycycline may be replaced by a 1g, single dose of azithromycin.
A 10-day course of 300mg ofloxacin twice a day is typically used to treat epididymitis caused by E. coli.

, These can be used to reduce the pain of the inflammation. They're convenient as they're probably already in your bathroom cabinet and relatively effective. However, self-medication with an analgesic like ibuprofen should not extend for more that 10 days.


For ibuprofen, 200mg given every 4-6 hours should help to reduce the pain and inflammation associated with epididymitis in adults. This dose can be increased to 400mg if necessary.

, Resting in bed for a few days will help you deal with the pain associated with the condition. As long as you will be staying in bed, your crotch area will suffer a small amount of stress, reducing pain. Keep the testicles elevated as often as possible to keep your symptoms at bay.


When lying or sitting, placing a towel or rolled shirt below the scrotum can help to reduce discomfort.

, Applying cold packs to your scrotum will reduce inflammation by decreasing the blood flow. Simply wrap the ice pack in a towel and apply it to the scrotum. Keep it there for about 30 minutes and no longer in order to avoid skin damage.Never apply ice directly to your skin. That's just asking for more trouble!

, Fill your bathtub with 12–13 inches (30.5–33.0 cm) of warm water, and sit there for about 30 minutes. The warm water will increase the blood flow and help the body to fight off the infection. You can do this as often as you need.

, There are three main herbs that have been found to help with epididymitis:



Echinacea. This herb is great for fighting infection and reducing inflammation. You can use it to make a healthy tea. Mix one tablespoon of dried Echinacea flowers with a quarter of a tablespoon dried peppermint and boil the mix in a pot of water. Drink the tea each day, for pain relief.

Pulsatilla. Pulsatilla comes in two forms: tincture and infusion. The Pulsatilla herb has great anti-inflammatory properties. When used as a tincture, you must administer 1 or 2 ml of tincture, three times a day. For preparing an infusion, you will need one teaspoon of dried herb and one cup of water. Put the herb in the boiling water and leave it to infuse for 10-15 minutes.

Horsetail. Another great herb that can help you get rid of this condition is horsetail. It has great antimicrobial properties, and will help you reduce inflammation. You can use one to three tablespoons of dried or fresh horsetail leaves for preparing a cup of tea. Put the desired amount of herb in a cup and pour boiling water over it. Let it infuse for five to ten minutes, strain the herbs and drink the tea.

Consider your age.,
Look at male relatives on both sides of the family.,
Understand the impact of taking steroids.,
Understand the correlation with prostate growth.,
Monitor your hairline.,
Check the crown of your head.,
Look for hair on your pillow and hair brush / comb.,
Distinguish between other causes of hair loss.,
Consult with a hair loss specialist.",How to Know if You Have Male Pattern Baldness," The incidence of male pattern baldness increases significantly with age. Your age is one of three main risk factors for the condition (along with heredity and androgen imbalance).Up to two thirds of American men by the age of 35 experience male pattern baldness, but that increases to over 80% for men older than 50 years.As such, consider your age and correlate it to your hair loss. Although male pattern baldness can begin in early adulthood (albeit rarely), it becomes much more common with age. Sudden hair loss in a teenager or young adult is usually related to some disease, medical treatment or toxicity (see below).


Male pattern baldness is the most common type of hair loss in men, accounting for about 95% of it.
About 25% of men who suffer with male pattern baldness begin the process before the age of 21 years.;
, It is a common myth that baldness only comes from the mother's side of the family, and that if your mother's father was bald, you may be, too. Genetics account for 80% of baldness,but you are just as likely to be bald if your father or your father's father is bald, too.As such, look at your father, grandfathers, uncles, and male cousins (any first and second-degree relatives) and see if they still have a full head of hair. If they don't, take note of the degree of hair loss and ask them when they first noticed losing their hair. The more relatives you see who are bald, the greater your risk of male pattern baldness.


One gene of the several causing baldness is passed from mother to son, but other genes are passed in the usual way, and thus bald fathers can had bald sons.
Baldness occurs when the hair follicle on the scalp shrinks over time, which results in shorter and finer hair. Eventually, the atrophied follicle does not grow new hair, although it typically remains alive.

, Sex hormones called androgens are another primary factor of male pattern baldness. The main culprits in men are the hormones testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT).Testosterone converts to DHT with the aid of an enzyme that's in the oil glands of hair follicles. Too much DHT shrinks hair follicles, making it impossible for healthy hair to grown and survive. This problem is caused by either too much circulating testosterone and/or abnormally high binding of DHT to receptors in scalp follicles. Abnormal binding or sensitivity to DHT is largely genetic, but a common cause of higher levels of DHT is the use of steroids — particularly in younger men who want to gain muscle mass for bodybuilding or athletic advantage.Thus, taking anabolic steroids greatly increases your risk of hair loss to nearly a 100% certainty if taken long enough.


It's normal to lose about 50-100 hairs every day, depending on your lifestyle, but much more than that is a sign of male pattern baldness or other condition that affects the hair follicle or scalp.Drugs used to treat male pattern baldness, such as finasteride (Propecia, Proscar), work by preventing the conversion of testosterone to DHT.

, Another indication that you're experiencing or at greater risk of male pattern balding is prostate gland growth.Benign prostate growth is very common with advancing age and also correlated to DHT levels. Thus, if you experience the signs and symptoms of prostate enlargement and suspect male pattern baldness, then it likely isn't your imagination because both conditions are caused by high DHT levels.


Signs and symptoms of an enlarged prostate include increased frequency and urgency of urination, difficulty initiating or stopping urination, pain with urination, incontinence.Other medical conditions correlated or associated with male pattern baldness include prostate cancer, coronary heart disease, diabetes and chronic high blood pressure (hypertension)., Male pattern baldness usually begins at the front of your scalp, called your frontal hairline. The hairline gradually moves backward (recedes) and forms an ""M"" shape in most people with male pattern baldness, with the temples receding back more than the middle section of the scalp.Eventually the hair becomes thinner and shorter, and creates a horseshoe pattern around the sides of the head. The horseshoe pattern is a sign of advanced male pattern baldness, but some men can progress beyond and become completely bald.


Monitoring your hairline can easily be done by looking in the mirror and comparing what you see to photographs of your younger self.
The ""M"" shape pattern is a characteristic feature of male pattern baldness because hair in the temples (and crown) appear to be the most sensitive to DHT levels.
However, some people don't exhibit an ""M"" pattern, but more of a half moon pattern, where the entire front hairline recedes back in unison and does not leave a ""widow's peak.""

, In addition to thinning and receding of the frontal hairline, the same process can occur on the top (crown) of the head.Sometimes balding of the crown precedes a receding hairline, sometimes it follows after, and sometimes it happens concurrently. As noted, the hair follicles at the crown of the scalp seems to be more sensitive to DHT levels — much more so compared to the hair follicles above the ears or at the very back of the scalp.


To check the crown of your head, you'll need to hold a handheld mirror above your head while looking into your vanity mirror. Alternatively, get your partner or a friend to take a photo of your crown. Compare photos over time to judge the extent of your hair loss.
A sign from the front that may indicate thinning and hair loss at your crown is a widening side or middle part.

, Some hair loss on a daily basis is normal and it typically grows right back, but aggressive male pattern balding leads to very noticeable amounts of permanent shedding.Keep your pillowcase clean and note how much hair you lose while sleeping (take pictures to document it). If it's much more than a dozen or so hairs per night, that might be cause for some concern. If you use a brush, make sure it's free of hair before you use it and then examine it after your normal brushing routine. Brushing triggers more hair loss naturally (especially if your hair is long), but more than a few dozen hairs is not normal and a sign of male pattern balding.


If you have dark hair, use a light-colored pillowcase to highlight hair loss. Conversely, use a dark-colored pillowcase if your have light hair.
Using a hair conditioner while washing your hair might lead to less tangles, which might lead to less hair loss from brushing or combing.
If you wear a ponytail, consider letting it out at night while you sleep. The tightness can lead to more hair loss as you turn from side to side in the night.
Keep in mind that the early phases of male pattern baldness mainly involve thinning and shortening of hair, and not necessarily hair loss.

, Although male pattern baldness is the most common cause of hair loss in men (by far), there are some other causes that you should be familiar with, such as: endocrine gland (pituitary, thyroid) disorders, malnutrition (especially protein), fungal infection, iron deficiency, taking too much vitamin A or selenium, over-medicating (particularly retinoids and anticoagulants) and cancer treatments (chemotherapy, radiation).Severe loss of hair from all areas of the scalp within a very short period of time is not male pattern baldness. It's likely related to environmental toxicity (such as lead poisoning), over-medication, high doses of radiation or extreme levels of emotional trauma (shock or fright).
If your hair loss is patchy and involves widespread scaling that spreads over your scalp, then you likely have a ringworm infection.Other symptoms include broken hair, skin swelling, redness and oozing.
Certain hair treatments, such as applying hot oil, dyes or chemicals meant to straighten hair, can cause scalp damage and permanent hair loss.

, To be completely sure if you are affected by male pattern baldness, make an appointment with a hair loss specialist, who is likely a dermatologist or physician with special training. Typical male pattern baldness is usually diagnosed based on the appearance and pattern of hair loss.However, your doctor will also ask about your extended family (particularly on your mom's side) and carefully examine your scalp under magnification (with a device called a densitometer) in order to assess the extent of miniaturization of the hair follicles.


Hair analysis or a scalp biopsy are not needed to properly diagnose your hair loss.
Your doctor should let you know about all the potential treatments for male pattern balding, not just medications or hair transplant surgery.

Look for symptoms of overflow incontinence.,
See your doctor.,
Identify medications that can lead to overflow incontinence.,
Ask about medications designed to treat overflow incontinence.,
Consider surgical options for severe symptoms.",How to Prevent Male Incontinence2," Overflow incontinence occurs due to an outlet obstruction that then “overflows” to cause incontinence. Benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) is a leading cause because the enlarged prostate pushes against and pinches off the urethra as it passes through the prostate. However, other conditions can also cause the symptoms, which include:Increased urinary frequency
Urinary hesitancy (trouble urinating despite needing to)
Nocturia (going to the restroom at night a lot)
Weakened urinary stream
Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs)
Urinary incontinence
Occasion urinary retention (cannot urinate at all)

, While BPH is one of the most common causes of overflow incontinence, it’s not the only cause. See your doctor and describe your symptoms in order to help him or her determine the correct diagnosis for your specific condition.


A tumor in the bladder or prostate can also lead to overflow incontinence, so your doctor will likely perform a screening to rule out these possibilities. Tests will include a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test of your blood, a digital rectal exam (DTE) to feel for prostate abnormalities, and/or a cystoscopy (a tube inserted into the bladder via the urethra to check for a tumor). If the doctor finds a tumor in any of these instances, he or she will like perform a biopsy to determine whether it is benign or malignant.

, During your appointment, your doctor will also ask about any medications you take since some of them can lead to overflow incontinence as a side effect. Diuretics for cardiac problems, sedatives, and muscle relaxants are common medications that can lead to incontinence issues. Some antidepressants, sleeping pills, and high blood pressure medications have also been linked to overflow incontinence.Since many of these medications are prescriptions to help with much more serious issues than just incontinence, never stop taking a prescribed medication unless under the guidance of your doctor.
Though not medications, excess consumption of coffee, tea, alcohol, and vitamins B or C can also lead to overflow incontinence. Your doctor can run a blood panel to test if your diet is too high in B and/or C vitamins.

, For mild-to-moderate BPH symptoms, there are several prescription medications that are available for symptom control such as:Alpha blockers such as Hytrin, which does not actually work to shrink the size of the prostate, but will relieve symptoms within a few weeks
5-alpha-reductase inhibitors such as Avodart work to reduce the size of the prostate but may not improve symptoms for up to six months
Cialis, which although originally marketed for erectile dysfunction (ED) improves symptoms of BPH as well
Your doctor may prescribe a combination of Avodart and Hytrin to have both advantages. This is common, safe, and effective approach to control overflow incontinence.

, A transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is the go-to procedure for relieving lower urinary tract outlet obstruction due to enlargement of the prostate blocking of the bladder from emptying.This technique uses an endoscope to enter the urethra and clear or ablate the excessive prostate tissue encroaching on the urethra.The procedure can use anything from a laser or microwave to needle ablation or photoselective vaporization. It is minimally invasive and done as an office procedure in many cases.It may require a secondary operation in a decade due to tissue regrowth."

Identify symptoms of stress incontinence.,
Identify causes of stress incontinence.,
See your doctor.,
Lose weight.,
Use Kegel exercises.,
Consider surgical weight loss options.",How to Prevent Male Incontinence3," Stress incontinence more often relates to leaking urine than some of the more myriad symptoms associated with overflow incontinence. You may notice the leakage when you laugh, cough, sneeze, jog, or lift heavy objects., Increased pressure on the bladder due to obesity or pregnancy is the most common cause of stress incontinence. Stress incontinence can also occur due to a lack of bladder sphincter pressure as a result of surgical complications. Surgeries commonly associated with this complication include prostate surgery and transurethral resections of the prostate.Stress incontinence can results from 10-20% of TURP surgeries or higher percentages from prostate cancer surgery., Your doctor will examine your symptoms and run a variety of tests to determine the best course of action for your case. For obese patients, this may include testing for metabolic disorders, such as underlying thyroid conditions, that may have caused the weight gain., If your doctor concludes that your weight has placed unnecessary pressure on your bladder, he or she will likely suggest that you lose weight as a primary treatment for the condition.


This will include turning to a healthy, well-balanced diet in conjunction with a regular exercise routine. You can find more information at How to Lose Weight and How to Eat Healthy.
You may want to consult a dietician and a personal trainer to develop the best, healthiest plan for you in order to lose weight.

, Though known primarily for helping women to improve pelvic floor muscles after pregnancy, men can also perform Kegels to help with stress incontinence. Perform by clenching the muscles that control urination. You may initially have to practice by cutting off your urinary stream midstream to get a good idea of how the clenches should feel when doing them apart from actually urinating.Slowly clench while counting to five before using another five count to slowly release. Perform Kegels in sets of ten up to three times per day., For morbidly obese patients, their physician may recommend lap band or other weight loss surgery options. In one study, 71% of participants who lost 18+ BMI (body mass index) points as a result of gastric bypass surgery had regained urinary continence by one year after the procedure."

Identify causes of neurogenic bladder incontinence.,
See your doctor.,
Try physical-psychological therapy options.,
Discuss medication options with your doctor.,
Discuss surgical options with your doctor.",How to Prevent Male Incontinence4," Urination occurs by a complex arc of nerves communicating with the brain and causing muscles within the bladder and surrounding areas to contract and relax. If you have a neuromuscular disorder—such as multiple sclerosis (MS), for example—you may experience disruptions in these signals, resulting in a neurogenic bladder. People who have had a stroke can also have a resultant neurogenic bladder if the muscles that cause the bladder muscles to contract and relax are affected.

, Most of those who have a neurogenic bladder will already be familiar with the underlying causes. However, you should still see your doctor for a positive diagnosis. You doctor will also provide you with the best overview of treatment options and weigh in on which is likely best for your specific situation.

, Also known as timed voiding, physical-psychological therapy combines will power and exercise to help treat the incontinence. This combines Kegel exercises (outlined in the method on stress incontinence) and a voiding diary to help you avoid incontinence episodes before they occur.


A voiding diary is a daily record of the fluids you’ve taken in, the times and amounts you urinated, and the instances of leakage. You can use this record to help determine the best times to stay close to a bathroom, as well as times when you should force yourself to go, to minimize incontinence episodes.

, Though no drugs currently target the bladder sphincter to help with neurogenic bladder, some drugs do reduce muscle spasms or induce contractions. Your doctor will help determine if one of these classes of medications can help with your specific case.

, A variety of difference surgical options are available, depending upon the underlying cause for your neurogenic bladder. Your doctor may discuss:


Electrical-stimulatory therapy, which involves electrodes and a small stimulator implanted to help deliver the signals disrupted by the damaged nerves
An artificial sphincter, which is a cuff that attaches to the neck of the bladder and works in coordination with an implanted pump and regulating balloon to collect the urine.

Avoid foods that trigger higher PSA levels.,
Eat more tomatoes.,
Drink pomegranate juice.,
Consider supplementing with Pomi-T. Pomi-T is a commercially available dietary supplement that contains raw powdered pomegranate, broccoli, green tea and turmeric.,
Try supplementing with PC-SPES.,
Consult with your doctor about PSA test results.,
Consider taking aspirin.,
Talk to your doctor about other medications that can lower PSA levels.",How to Lower Prostate–Specific Antigens (PSA)," Certain foods seem to affect the prostate gland negatively and increase blood levels of PSA. More specifically, diets rich in dairy products (milk, cheese, yogurt) and animal fat (meat, lard, butter) have been linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer.Therefore, switching to a healthy diet that's low in saturated fat and high in antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables can reduce your risk of prostate cancer and lower PSA levels.


Dairy products seem to trigger higher levels of an insulin-like growth factor, which has been connected to high PSA levels and poor prostate health.
When you eat meat, opt for lower fat varieties such as turkey and chicken. Low-fat diets may also be connected to improved prostate health overall and reduce the risk of benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlargement).
Substitute fish for meat more often. Fatty fish (salmon, tuna, herring) are rich in omega-3 fats, which have been linked to a reduced risk of prostate cancer.
Dark blue/purple berries and grapes, as well as dark green veggies, tend to be highest in antioxidants, which prevent the damaging effects of oxidation on tissues, organs and glands (such as the prostate).;
, Tomatoes are a rich source of lycopene, which is a carotenoid (plant pigment and antioxidant) that protects tissues from stress and helps them utilize energy better. Diets rich in tomatoes and tomato products (such as tomato sauces and pastes) are linked to lower risks of prostate cancer and contribute to reducing PSA levels circulating in the blood.Lycopene appears to be more bioavailable (easier for the body to absorb and utilize) when tomatoes are cooked such as when it's in processed products like tomato paste and tomato puree.


Some research indicates that more lycopene may be bioavailable from diced tomatoes cooked with olive oil than those cooked without.
Although the main source of lycopene in the American diet is tomato-based products, other sources include apricots, guavas and watermelons.If you cannot eat or don't like tomatoes for some reason, you can still get the PSA-reducing benefit of lycopene by taking a 4 mg supplement on a daily basis.

, Natural pomegranate juice contains many healthy compounds, some of which positively impact the prostate gland and keep PSA levels low.For example, the seeds, flesh and peel from pomegranates contain powerful antioxidants such as flavonoids, phenolics and anthocyanins. These phytochemicals are believed to hinder the growth of cancer cells and slow down PSA from accumulating in the blood. Pomegranate juice is also a good source of vitamin C, which stimulates the immune system and allows the body to repair its tissues — both of which positively impact PSA levels.


Try to drink a glass of pomegranate juice each day. If pure pomegranate juice does not appeal to you (too sour), look for a sweeter juice blend that contains pomegranate in it.
Select the most natural and pure pomegranate products. Processing tends to destroy phytochemicals and vitamin C.
Pomegranate extract is also available in capsules and can be taken as a daily dietary supplement.

, Research in 2013 concluded that Pomi-T significantly lowers PSA levels in patients with prostate cancer.Each of the ingredients are strong antioxidants and have anticancer properties, but when they're combined together there seems to be a synergistic effect that boosts effectiveness.The research was based on men with prostate cancer taking the supplement for six months. They found that Pomi-T is well tolerated and not thought to cause any negative side effects.


Broccoli is a cruciferous veggie high in sulfur-based compounds, which fight cancer and combat oxidative damage in tissues. The more you cook broccoli, the less beneficial it becomes, so stick with raw varieties.
Green tea contains catechins, which are antioxidants that can help kill cancer cells while dropping PSA levels in the blood. If you make a cup of green tea, don't use scalding water because it will reduce some of its antioxidant strength.
Turmeric is a strong anti-inflammatory that contains curcumin — the component responsible for lowering PSA levels by restricting the spread of prostate cancer cells.

, PC-SPES (which means ""hope for prostate cancer"") is a dietary supplement made from the extracts of eight different Chinese herbs. It's been around for many years and commercially available at most health food stores. Research done in 2000 concluded that PC-SPES can significantly reduce PSA levels in men with advanced prostate disease.Researchers believe that PC-SPES acts somewhat like estrogen (the main female hormone) by lowering testosterone levels in men, which shrinks the prostate and reduces PSA levels.


All the men studied who took PC-SPES for two years (nine capsules daily) had their PSA levels drop by 80% or more, and the decline lasted for over a year after they stopped the supplements.
PC-SPES is a mixture of baikal skullcap, chrysanthemum flowers, Reishi mushrooms, isatis, licorice root, ginseng root (Panax ginseng), rabdosia rubescens and saw palmetto berries., The vast majority of men get a PSA blood test because they have prostate symptoms — such as deep pelvic pain, discomfort when sitting, trouble urinating, more frequent urination, blood in semen and/or erectile dysfunction;however, there are many conditions that affect the prostate (infection, cancer, benign hypertrophy, spasms) and many causes of increased PSA levels (as noted above). As such, PSA test results are not definitive for cancer because they tend to have many false positives (false alarms). Your doctor will consider the PSA test result in addition to your personal history, physical exam of the prostate or possibly a biopsy (tissue sample) of the gland before any diagnosis is made.It used to be that a PSA test less than 4 ng/mL was thought to be healthy and a reading greater than 10 ng/mL was considered high risk for prostate cancer; however, it's been discovered than men with prostate cancer can have readings below 4 ng/mL and others with healthy prostates can have readings well above 10 ng/mL.Ask about alternative PSA testing. There are three alternative forms of PSA testing (in addition to the standard one) that doctors now consider: percent-free PSA only looks at the free circulating PSA in the blood, not the total PSA level; PSA velocity uses the results of other PSA tests to determine the change of PSA levels over time; a urine PC3 test looks for a fusion of genes common to at least half of PSA-tested men with prostate cancer.

, Research conducted in 2008 concluded that aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help lower PSA levels when taken regularly.Researchers don't know the exact mechanism of how aspirin impacts the prostate (it wasn't due to shrinking the gland), but regular male users have almost 10% lower PSA levels on average compared to men who don't take aspirin or other NSAIDs; however, talk to your doctor about the risks of taking aspirin long-term, such as stomach irritation, ulcers and reduced clotting ability of blood.


The aspirin users who experience the biggest impact to their PSA levels are men who have advanced prostate cancer and non-smokers.
Low-dose coated aspirin (often called baby aspirin) is the safest option for men who want to take the drug long-term (more than a few months).
Due to the fact that aspirin and other NSAIDs ""thin"" the blood (make it less able to clot) there is also reduced risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular diseases.

, There are a number of other medications that can potentially lower PSA levels, although most are meant for conditions and diseases not related to the prostate gland. It's never a good idea to take medications for conditions you don't have in order to lower PSA levels — especially since PSA levels are difficult to interpret and high PSA levels are not always an indication of prostate disease.Drugs meant for the prostate include 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (finasteride, dutasteride), which are used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia or urinary symptoms. These inhibitors may lower PSA levels as a secondary benefit, but not in every man who takes them.Cholesterol-lowering medications called statins (Lipitor, Crestor, Zocor) are also linked to lower PSA levels — if they're taken for a few years or more; however, this secondary benefit is cancelled out if you're also taking calcium channel blockers for high blood pressure.Thiazide diuretics are ""water pills"" used to treat high blood pressure. Long-term use of thiazide diuretics is associated with lower PSA levels."

Try hormone treatments and medications.",How to Increase Your Sperm Count," There's a reason our testicles rest outside our bodies: they need to stay a bit cooler than the rest of our internal organs. When testicles get too warm, they aren't able to produce as much sperm.There are a number of ways to make sure your testicles don't get overheated:


Don't wear tight pants and jeans.
Wear loose, cotton boxer shorts instead of briefs.
Sleep without underwear so that your testicles stay cooler.
Avoid hot baths and saunas.;
, It goes without saying, because most men know this from experience, but a blow to the balls will hurt you and kill your sperm.

, This, along with regular exercise, improves overall blood flow and circulation. Increased circulation means healthier sperm.

, Stress can decrease your sexual function, leading to reduced sperm production.If you work 12 plus hour days and never give yourself a chance to rest, your count might be down as a result. Try practicing relaxation techniques throughout the day to keep yourself feeling calm. Keep your mind and body healthy by regularly practicing yoga and meditation, or take up running or swimming.


Stress hormones block Leydig cells, which are tasked with regulating testosterone production. When your body experiences too much stress, it can actually stop producing sperm altogether.
Make sure you're getting enough sleep every night. Exhaustion can also lead to increased stress and cause decreased sperm production.

, Smoking cigarettes causes sperm counts to be lower, makes them move more slowly, and causes the sperm themselves to be misshapen. According to one study, men who smoke have 22% fewer sperm than men who don't. Marijuana seems to have a similar effect on sperm.Cutting back on both of these substances is a good idea if you want to boost your count.

, Alcohol affects your liver function, which, in turn, causes a dramatic spike in estrogen levels. (Yes, men have estrogen.) Since testosterone is directly linked to sperm health and sperm production, this isn't a good state of affairs. Even two drinks a day will have long-term effects on sperm production.

, Frequent ejaculations can lower sperm count. Your body produces millions of sperm each day, but if you already have low sperm count, consider storing them up longer between ejaculations. If you have sex or masturbate daily, cut down on the frequency for increased sperm production.

, Exposure to chemicals can affect the size, movement and count of your sperm. It's more and more difficult to avoid exposure to toxins, but it's absolutely necessary for your overall health and the health of your sperm. Do the following to decrease your exposure:


If you work around chemicals all day long, protect your skin with long sleeves and gloves, and make sure you wear a mask and goggles to protect your face.Use natural cleaning supplies instead of cleaning with chemicals.
Don't use pesticides or herbicides in your house or yard.

, Certain medications can lead to decreased sperm count and even permanent infertility. If sperm production is a big concern for you, make sure you ask your doctor whether any medication prescribed might affect your sperm count.Look at the labels on over-the-counter medicines, too.

, Finding out a workable exercise regimen is a tough task in the modern world, but rest assured that exercise will help you produce more sperm. Exercise releases testosterone into your body, helping with sperm production. Use compound exercises and lift heavy weights, but refrain from working the same set of muscles the day after. Giving your muscles time to rest and rebuild should help you produce testosterone.


Do not exercise too much! Excessive exercise causes the release of adrenal steroid hormones that actually cause a testosterone deficiency. So whether you want to put on that extra muscle or help out your sperm, remember not to stress your body too much.
Do not use anabolic steroids. Anabolic steroids may help you pack on the pounds, but they shrink your testicles and may cause infertility. If you're trying to conceive, stay far, far away.

, A diet that's low in fat, and high in protein, vegetables, and whole grains is good for your health and for your sperm.


Eat plenty of fish, meat, eggs, fruits and vegetables.
Peanuts, walnuts, cashews, sunflower and pumpkin seeds are also considered to increase sperm count.
Avoid soy-based foods and high-fructose corn syrup. Soy foods have a mild estrogenic effect on the body. While that may be good for women, it's not great for grooming sperm. High-fructose corn syrup causes insulin resistance, which lowers fertility. Men who drink a quart of Coke regularly have 30% less sperm than men who don't drink Coke.

, Losing weight will help you counteract low sperm count. Scientists don't know why obesity correlates to low sperm count, but a recent French study found that obese men were 42 percent more likely to have low sperm count than their non-obese counterparts. In the same study, scientists found that obese men were 81 percent more likely to have no sperm at all in their ejaculate.There are a number of different theories for why this is. Some speculate that fatty tissue converts testosterone into estrogen; others speculate that more mass in the thighs could make the testicles too hot.

, Researches found that men who consumed 5 mg of folic acid and 66 mg of zinc sulfate a day for 26 weeks experienced an almost 75 percent increase in sperm count. Folic acid and zinc sulfate are critical in the formation of DNA.


Vitamin C and selenium may also be good supplements to take in order to increase sperm production.

, They help you to increase your sperm count. Homeopathic ingredients include the following:


Passiflora Incarnata can restore the male sexuality and increase sperm count in men who have low sperm count due to smoking Marijuana etc ,
Zincum Metallicum: this homeopathic ingredient increases the elemental zinc and helps to improve the semen quality and sperm count. Damiana, Yohinbinum: These homeopathic ingredients have been studied scientifically for their effects to boost male sexuality and improve the libido. Herbs such as Ipomoea digitata, Emblica officinalis, Chlorophytum arundinaceum , Argyreia speciosa, Mucuna pruriens, Withania somnifera , Tinospora cordifolia , Tribulus terrestris, Sida cordifolia, and Asparagus racemosus, have been used as natural Aphrodisiac. They increase the Testosterone levels and also correct the erectile dysfunction. Herbs such as withania somnifera also act as a natural anxiolytic. It reduces physical and psychological stress and may help men with stress as the main causative factor for their low sperm count.

, Certain sexually transmitted infections, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea, can cause scarring that interferes with the passage of sperm.Get regularly tested for STIs; if you have one, be sure to get the proper treatment. In most cases you'll be prescribed a course of antibiotics to clear up the infection.

, This is a swelling of the veins that drain the testicle. It can lead to increased temperature of the testicle and decreased sperm count. See your doctor to determine if this might be affecting your fertility. If so, a surgical procedure can take care of the problem., It's possible that your sperm count is low because your hormones are out of balance. Hormone replacement treatments and medications can change your hormone levels and help you produce more sperm. Talk with your doctor about whether this option is right for you.


Hormone replacement treatments and medications usually take at least 3 months to work before you start seeing results.

Identify the symptoms of an overactive bladder.,
See your doctor.,
Use timed voiding.,
Ask your doctor about potential medications.",How to Prevent Male Incontinence5," An overactive bladder (OAB) is a syndrome which leads to an immediate and unstoppable need to urinate.Common symptoms of the syndrome include:Urinary urgency (primary symptom)
Urgency incontinence (not making it to the toilet quickly enough)
High urinary frequency and nocturia (getting up at night to go)

, Your doctor will help you officially diagnose OAB as the underlying cause. Only 2% of men who suffer from OAB experience regular symptoms of incontinence, so your doctor will want to exhaust other potential causes.Your doctor will likely perform a physical exam, as well as ordering urinalysis to test your urine and potentially even a cystoscopy in complicated cases.Findings also suggest the overactivity of the detrusor muscle, which is found in the wall of the bladder., Treatment involves behavioral therapy with a timed-voiding regimen. A timed voiding regimen involves going to urinate at set times—for example, every four hours—whether or not you actually feel the need to empty your bladder.


This is a bladder retraining regimen, and a form of cognitive behavior therapy. Trying to train the bladder to empty at certain times to prevent incontinence.
A recent report has shown that biofeedback-assisted behavioral therapy (timed voiding) was shown to be superior to pharmacologic therapy with Oxybutynin or placebo in patients receiving treatment for detrusor instability.Biofeedback is when a patient is attached to some electrodes that measure their subjective, unconscious physiologic responses. That way they can see in plain sight when their body is having a physiologic response (such as the urge to urinate, and attend to their needs) versus a “false alarm.” This ability to see factual data rather than guessing increases their accuracy of judging their bodies cues.

, There are some pharmacologic interventions, specifically Ditropan, which is dosed as 5 mg twice daily or 5 mg extended release tablet once daily. Combination therapies, using combination of behavioral, pharmacologic, and biofeedback are common."

Talk to your doctor.,
Start a health journal to monitor your response to Alprazolam.,
Remember to eat.,
Eat a nutrient-dense diet to cope with energy loss.,
Bring your libido back to life with a well balanced diet.,
Deal with your slurred speech.,
Cope with rebound insomnia.,
Seek medical attention if you have rare side effects.",How to Deal with Alprazolam Side Effects1," If you are experiencing any side effects or an addiction to Alprazolam, you should contact your doctor immediately. Your doctor may be able to make adjustments to your treatment plan or otherwise help you deal with side effects.Remember that Alprazolam (or any drug in the benzodiazepine category) is intended for very short-term use and should never be stopped abruptly. Alprazolam can be habit forming, and you can quickly develop a tolerance for the drug, meaning you need higher doses to feel any effect.
A small percentage of people are recommended to take Alprazolam as part of a regular treatment regimen. If this is the case, you and your doctor should carefully monitor for increased tolerance, interactions with other medications, and any side effects.;
, You should start a health journal, such as a paper journal or a file on your personal computer or device. Keeping a health journal can help you track the medications you are taking to manage your anxiety or panic disorder. It can also help you monitor any immediate side effects from Alprazolam, as well as communicate these side effects to your doctor.Side effects include impaired memory, drowsiness, forgetfulness, difficulty concentrating, difficulty speaking, slurred speech, loss of interest or pleasure, depression, weakness, trouble performing routine tasks, difficulty with coordination and muscle control, lack of appetite, and more., Although you may experience a loss of appetite, dry mouth, nausea or an upset stomach during the course of your treatment, you should remember to eat. Eat regular small meals. Avoid larger meals that could worsen these side effects.You should try to eat four to five small meals a day.
You should eat a balanced diet that includes a good mix of fruits and vegetables, healthy grains, fiber and protein.Try to eat at least five fruits and vegetables a day.Avoid eating too much saturated fat and sugar.Make sure you are getting enough protein, such as beans, pulses, fish, meat and eggs., Try eating more beans, nuts, whole grains and vegetables. You should look for foods that have a lot of antioxidants such as fresh fruits and vegetables. You should also remember to eat a solid breakfast and incorporate healthy snacks into your routine. Try integrating more of the following superfoods into your diet to increase your energy:Almonds
Avocado
Quinoa
Flax seeds
Dates
Seaweed
Berries
Edamame

, If you are experiencing a loss of libido since going on Alprazolam, you should make sure you are getting plenty of exercise, staying hydrated and eating a balanced diet. In particular, make sure you are getting enough vitamin C, iron, collagen-rich foods, and using spices like nutmeg in your cooking. Consider integrating more of the following foods into your diet:Sweet potatoes
Dark chocolate
Watermelon
Nutmeg and clove
Brazil nuts
Almonds
If diet and exercise doesn’t work, you should ask your doctor about treatment options.

, Your slurred speech could be caused by an overactive mind and your anxiety or by the muscle relaxant effects of Alprazolam. Start by telling your doctor, so they can take this side effect into consideration in your treatment plan.When you get the slurred speech, avoid forcing the words out. Forcing yourself to speak will add stress. Relax and speak when you are ready., Although Alprazolam is sometimes used to treat insomnia, it can sometimes cause rebound insomnia. If you take Alprazolam at night or are getting off the drug, you may experience rebound insomnia.To manage your rebound insomnia, you should set a regular bedtime and avoid all screens before going to sleep. Ensure you have a good sleeping environment, including a comfortable mattress and temperature in your bedroom. In addition, you could try the following tips:Read by candlelight before going to sleep.
Write in your journal before going to sleep.
Turn off all of the lights in your room.
Use aromatherapy such as lavender scents.

, If you have any of the rare side effects, you should seek immediate medical attention. For instance, seek medical attention if you have rare side effects such as chest pain or suicidal thoughts. Remember to document rare side effects in your health journal. Rare side effects include, but are not limited to, the following:Chest pain
Ear pain
Decreased awareness
Loss of hearing
Slowing down of mental activity
Inability to control your legs
Complete loss of energy
Talking in your sleep
Changes in your voice
Suicidal thoughts

Drink fluids.,
Keep the heat away.,
Avoid wearing tight underwear.,
Avoid sitting with your legs crossed.,
Abstain from orgasm (for a day or two).,

Try horny goat weed.,
Eat lots of fruits and vegetables.,
Perform regular PC muscle exercises.,
Stop smoking, if you haven't already.,
Learn to manage your stress.,

Practice safe sex.",How to Increase Your Ejaculate," The amount of semen that is released during orgasm is related to the volume of fluids that are ingested. That's because semen is water-based, and semen is the fluid that helps lubricate the way for sperm. The body needs two to three litres of water a day to function properly.Drinking more fluids should therefore increase your ejaculate.


If you enjoy a couple rounds of drinks after work and a couple more before the deed, you're doing your ejaculate a disservice. That's because alcohol dehydrates your body, leaving it less like a slip'n'slide and more like a deserted water park. In addition to dehydrating your body, alcohol lowers sperm count and affects the quality of your sperm.;
, Your mini-mes are delicate, like a flower in the tundra. They're so delicate that they wilt when they're exposed to excessive heat.This may help answer one of the burning questions of your youth — why are testicles outside the body? In fact, testes are housed outside the body instead of inside because they need to be able to maintain a lower temperature than 98.6 °F (37.0 °C), which is the temperature at which your body regulates heat.


What does this mean, practically speaking? If you enjoy long rides in cars with heated seats, or steamy shifts in the sauna/steam room, or even trips to your very own hot tub time machine, give them a break. They're not worth sacrificing your little cadets for.

, Again, the ideal temperature for semen and sperm is slightly lower than normal body temperature. Tight underwear will increase the scrotal temperature, thereby decreasing sperm and semen levels.

, This philosophical posture also affects the sperm and semen volumes to a great extent. By squashing the scrotal area against the warm body, you risk increasing its temperature above the normal range. That's a red alert, right there.

, Your body produces sperm at an astonishing rate of more than 1,500 every second, on average.That works out to anywhere from 130 to 200 million sperm cells a day.Still, whenever you orgasm, you lose a hefty portion of your serial soldiers. Try to wait a bit to increase the size of the army.


Abstaining from orgasm for one or two days is all it takes, in fact, for the body to replenish its army. Beyond one or two days, your sperm is just sitting and getting old, like tuckered out reserves.

, Zinc is an essential mineral that is instrumental in several factors of cellular metabolism.In combination with folic acid, zinc was found to increase sperm count by 74% in men who had fertility problems, according to one study.So how much zinc and folic acid should you take every day, you ask? 1 mg of folic acid and 15 mg of zinc sulfate is recommended.
Always remember to take zinc in combination with folic acid. Taken alone, neither supplement had a significant bearing on sperm count.

, Not only is soda rich in high fructose corn syrup bad for your liver, but it's also bad for your baby batter. Compared to men who drink no soda, those who drink more than a quart a day had 30% lower sperm counts., Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. These organic compounds, taken regularly, are reputed to boost levels of silly string.Scientists believe that sperm benefit from amino acids because certain amino acids are found in large quantities in the heads of sperm. Look out for the following amino acids to boost your ejaculate:


L-Arginine
L-Lysine
L-Carnitine

, According to legend, this supplement gets its name from a Chinese goat-herder who noticed some serious arousal in his flock after they chewed on a particular species of epimedium. But does this strange herb actually work? Horny goat weed is reputed to restrict enzymes that block blood flow to the penis.Whether or not this helps your diminutive dailies is still up for debate.

, Sometimes, all you need is a healthy diet. Fruits and veggies, especially, are rich in antioxidants, which could help improve the quality of life your sperm enjoy.Aside from increasing your ejaculate, foods rich in antioxidants will also make you healthier and help you feel better. Food rich in antioxidants include:


Red beans
Wild blueberries, cranberries, and blackberries
Coconut water
Prunes
Apples (Red Delicious, Granny Smith, Gala)
Artichokes, Also called Kegel exercises, PC muscle exercises (shorthand for ""pubococcygeus"" muscle) do a host of functions for both sexes, but in particular men. In addition to promoting prostate health and heading off premature ejaculation, they are instrumental in prolonging the duration of orgasm as well as increasing ejaculate., If you needed another compelling reason to quit smoking, add this one to the heap. Smoking not only lowers sperm count, but also possibly leads to higher imperfection rates in sperm.Expecting fathers who smoke while trying to get pregnant may have children with higher rates of medical issues. During both conception and after, keeping the mother in a smoke-free environment is the best course of action, hands down.
Smoking marijuana is a no-no, too. Marijuana is known to lower both the male hormone testosterone and sperm count., However stressful your life is, try to begin to come to grips with the fact that stress is fundamentally unhealthy. It turns out that stress hormones interfere with the testes' ability to manufacture testosterone, which is largely responsible for sperm production.In addition to diminished ejaculate, stress will also cause:


Acne and facial blemishes
Heart disease such as angina and heart attack
Insomnia, There's good evidence to suggest that regular physical exercise is beneficial in increasing sperm count.So put on your soccer cleats, football spikes, or court kicks and brush off some of the cobwebs in your moves.

, Safe sex is the final key to helping your little helpers go from small village to Roman dynasty. Some STIs like gonorrhea and chlamydia, can ultimately lead to infertility if left untreated. Always use protection. To be absolutely sure, engage in a mutually monogamous relationship with someone you trust.

Attend to your sadness or depression.,
Cope with forgetfulness.,
Deal with aggressive or impulsive behavior.",How to Deal with Alprazolam Side Effects2," If you experience any depression while on Alprazolam, you should talk to your doctor about altering your dosage or additional treatment.You should avoid taking other medications alongside the Alprazolam, unless otherwise advised by your doctor.
You should also avoid drinking any alcohol while on Alprazolam, as these substances tend to worsen your sadness or depression.
If you have started taking Alprazolam recreationally to enhance the experience of other drugs or alcohol, you should tell your doctor. Ask your doctor about drug rehabilitation options., To deal with forgetfulness from Alprazolam, you should speak to your pharmacist about limiting the course of your treatment over a short time period. In the meantime, you could cope by writing notes to yourself in a device or in a journal, which you could keep with you at all times. If you forget something important, you can just look it up in your device or journal., One of the most serious long term side effects is aggressive, impulsive and manic behavior. If you feel you are becoming overly hostile, angry, aggressive or manic, you should contact your doctor immediately.You should record these kinds of symptoms in your health journal and consult your doctor about treatment options.

Recognize if you are addicted to Alprazolam.,
Enroll in an outpatient treatment program.,
Go to an inpatient center.,
Try cognitive behavioral therapy.,
Do not suddenly stop taking the medication.,
Phone a Alprazolam help line.",How to Deal with Alprazolam Side Effects3," Consider whether you are using more than the prescribed dose. If you suspect you may be addicted to Alprazolam, you should seek immediate medical help.Symptoms of abuse may include problems concentrating, lack of inhibition, dizziness and depression.To determine whether you are addicted, consider whether you answer yes to any of the following:


“Do I have withdrawal symptoms when I don’t take Alprazolam?”
“Is my use of Alprazolam negatively impacting my personal relationships?”
“Is my desire for Alprazolam uncontrollable?”

, You will have to check in with a counsellor a few times a week and follow their recovery guidelines. During the course of your treatment, you will gradually come off the drug and take periodic drug tests.If you choose an outpatient treatment program, you will benefit from a strong family support network to support your recovery.
In person or online support groups can also help you recover.

, You will have the comfort of medical and psychological support on-hand during your recovery from Alprazolam addiction. You will also have immediate medical support if you experience any side effects during the detoxification process.


Inpatient recovery is more expensive than outpatient programs. However, you have the advantage of constant medical support and recovering away from potentially abusive environments.

, You will learn how to cope with your relationship to Alprazolam. You will also learn coping strategies for dealing the stress and anxiety that may have led you to addiction in the first place. This form of therapy may be a part of both inpatient and outpatient programs.You can find a cognitive behavioral therapist by phoning psychologists in your region and asking whether they use cognitive behavioral therapy.
You could ask your family physician for a referral to a psychologist who uses cognitive behavioral therapy.

, You should obtain proper treatment for Alprazolam addition rather than trying to wean yourself off the drug too suddenly or on your own. It is best to obtain professional medical help., If you are feeling very depressed and suicidal while on Alprazolam, you should phone for help. Ask the help line counsellor for advice and information on finding treatment for Alprazolam addiction.

While there is no conclusive scientific evidence that ginseng causes the penis to get bigger, men who took ginseng extract tablets as part of a study in South Korea experienced better sexual function after taking the supplements for several weeks.Ginseng contraindicates with several medications, and it can have negative side effects for people with certain cancers, heart disease, insomnia, and other disorders. Be sure to talk with your doctor before you begin taking ginkgo regularly.If you're considering taking ginseng supplements, look for a supplement labeled ""Korean ginseng root"" and take 500 mg per day.
Since herbal supplements are not regulated by the FDA, there is always a risk when taking them. Be sure to purchase the supplements from a reputable company, and never take more than the recommended dosage.;
, This herb is often taken to boost memory, but it also help with blood circulation and may enhance blood flow to the penis. According to a study conducted at the University of California, ginkgo is most effective at helping men on anti-depressants that can lead to sexual dysfunction. Another study found that gingko had no effect. Scientific data is inconclusive, but since gingko enhances memory and has relatively few side effects, it might be worth a try.Gingko can be consumed as a tea or a supplement in the form of a capsule. Both forms of the herb are widely available in health food stores.
Do not take gingko supplements if you have a history of seizures or you're on blood thinning medication. See your doctor to make sure this supplement is safe for you to take.

, This powder is known for being an aphrodisiac. It contains the photochemicals macamides and macaenes, which are said to boost energy and help men maintain erections. Because no conclusive scientific studies have been conducted on this substance, it's best to proceed with caution. Be sure to discuss it with your doctor before you start adding this supplement to your daily routine.

, This is an amino acid that leads to increased blood flow, helping the penis get larger during an erection. A study conducted at Tel Aviv University showed that some men experienced improvements after taking the supplement for 6 weeks. It's available in natural food stores, and the recommended dose is 1 gram three times a day.This supplement should not be taken if you're on nitroglycerin for your heart, because it can cause a drop in blood pressure. Talk with your doctor about whether you should take L-arginine., It's not an herb, but it has properties that might help increase the size and duration of erections in a similar way arginine. Watermelon contains an amino acid called citrulline, which gets converted into arginine and leads to the dilation of blood vessels.The fact that watermelon contains citrulline is a relatively new finding, so no studies have been conducted to find out how well it really works or how much watermelon you'd have to eat to see the benefits. However, since watermelon is considered a superfood when it comes to men's health, you can't go wrong by eating plenty of it while it's in season., The size of your penis, whether it's flaccid or erect, depends on how much blood it contains. Using tobacco products causes the body's arteries to become narrower, which in turn reduces blood flow to the penis. If you smoke, you're inhibiting your penis from being as large as it could be., Moving your body enhances circulatory healthy, strengthening the arteries that carry blood to your penis. If you don't exercise at all, your penis may not be realizing its full potential. Aim to exercise for about an hour a day, whether you want to go for a swim, a walk, a jog or a bike ride. Any type of exercise will help increase blood flow to your penis.


However, there's no way to exercise your penis itself in a way that will make it get bigger. The penis is composed of smooth muscle, which doesn't increase in mass with exercise., You may not be able to build up the penis itself through exercise, but if you strengthen your pelvic floor your body will be better able to hold blood in your penis. The pelvic floor presses on the vein that keeps blood from leaving the penis during erections. You can strengthen your pelvic floor using Kegel exercises. A trial conducted in Britain concluded that men who performed Kegel exercises experienced better sexual function than those who made other lifestyle changes but didn't perform the exercises.Find your pelvic floor by tightening the same muscle you use to stop your urine flow.
Tighten and release the muscle 8 times. Rest and do it 8 more times, and again until you've done 3 or 4 sets.
Do the exercises once a day for best results.

, Your penis may look smaller than it really is if it's partially obscured by skin that droops over the top. Losing belly fat is no simple task, but it can make a big difference when it comes to the perceived size of your penis. Start taking measures to lose weight and you'll likely see improvement in other areas as well. According to a report from Harvard, men with a 42-inch waist are 50 percent more likely to have erectile dysfunction (ED) than men with a 32-inch waist.A regular exercise regimen will help you slim down. Aim to do cardio exercises as well as weight training.
Eat whole foods, like lean meat, fish, whole grains, beans, legumes, vegetables, fruits and healthy oils.
Avoid refined and processed foods, excessive sugar and starch, and hydrogenated oils.

, There are a few simple, non-invasive devices you can use to help your penis grow and stay enlarged long enough to have sex. If your aim is to have a bigger, firmer erection without using drugs or invasive treatments, try one of these devices:


A penis ring. This works by holding blood in the penis when it becomes engorged during an erection. Your penis will temporarily be larger and stiffer.
A penis pump. It's a vacuum device that fits around the penis. When you operate a hand pump, it draws blood into the penis and keeps it erect temporarily.

, Since wanting a larger penis is such a common desire, there are a lot of scammers out there making promises they can't back up. There is no magic potion that will make your penis grow. It's completely genetic. Don't waste your money or jeopardize your health by falling prey to a company that promises to permanently give you a bigger penis with its product.

, These are cocktails of the herbs known to increase blood flow to the penis, but since they aren't regulated by the FDA, it's difficult to know what the side effects might be. It's better to try herbs one at a time, controlling your dosage so that you don't accidentally take too much.


Avoid ordering products online, even if the site selling them looks legitimate.
If you do end up buying such a product, be cautious. Be sure not to try any type of penis-enhancement product until you check with your doctor.

, These two techniques are said to lengthen the penis, and in some cases they do. But the longer it gets, the thinner it gets; both methods cause the penis to lose girth as it stretches out. The only time to use a penis stretcher is after having surgery, when it's necessary to prevent the accumulation of scar tissue.

, Surgical penis enlargement, or phalloplasty, has unfortunate side effects. The penis is extended in length, but you sacrifice function. After an enlargement procedure the penis is no longer able to stand out from the body; instead, it hangs between the legs. And sometimes, it no longer gets erect at all.Looking into natural solutions is a much better bet.


Phalloplasty is used to build up a very small penis, also called a ""micropenis,"" and in these cases the surgery is beneficial. However, phalloplasty performed on an average-length penis can lead to erectile dysfunction, scarring and deformity.

To arrange ceremony for a Bris (Jewish circumcision), find a Mohel (Jewish circumciser).",How to Get Circumcised," If you decide to get circumcised, a physician will perform a short, relatively simple surgical procedure that will remove part of the foreskin of your penis permanently. After a period of recovery, your penis will heal normally, but without the retractable foreskin.


Generally, circumcision is performed on infant babies, but it's also performed on consenting adults, generally for cosmetic or religious purposes.
You should only get circumcised by a licensed physician or a mohel with a good record and experience. Under no circumstances should you ever attempt to circumcise yourself, as one small mistake can be dangerous.;
, If you decide to go forward with circumcision, you should talk to your doctor about the procedure and set up a consultation. The procedure consists of the following steps, essentially:


Your genitals will be cleaned and prepped for surgery, and you will be anesthetized using a dorsal nerve blocker.A cut will be made in the foreskin on the upper side of the penis using scissors, while a second slit will be made on the underside of the penis, cutting away the foreskin around the rim of the ridge under the glans.
The edges of the foreskin will be pulled back and the blood vessels will be tied off using stitches or diathermy, which involves using electrical currents to essentially cauterize the ends of the vessels.
Finally, the edges of the foreskin will be stitched and your penis will be bandaged tightly to begin your recovery period., While there are many unconfirmed medical benefits to being circumcised, the truth is that most circumcisions are performed for religious or cosmetic reasons. Supposedly, circumcision reduces the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases, urinary tract infections, and penile cancer. Some adults who get circumcised do so for reasons of hygiene, complaining that an uncircumcised penis is more difficult to keep clean and less sexually attractive than a circumcised one.


The reduction of risk in these matters is quite low: urinary tract infections and penile cancer are already fairly uncommon in males, while STDs are still highly communicable if safe sex practices are not used. Most adults tend to get circumcised for reasons of aesthetics and hygiene, or for religious reasons.In less common cases, circumcision is also performed to correct phimosis, or constricted foreskin, acute inflammation of the glans as a result of balanitis, or paraphimosis, which involves a restricted foreskin., Essentially, a circumcision involves the willful cutting of your genitals, removing the most sensitive front tip of the foreskin of the penis. As with any elective surgery, there are possible complications. Typically done on infants, circumcision for adults carries with it a significant and uncomfortable period of recovery. Many people also claim that circumcision severs nerve endings in the penis and can irreversibly affect sexual stimulation.


As an adult, circumcision is a matter of personal choice and is controversial. Many circumcised adults celebrate the practice, and some decry it.Whatever you choose, try to weigh the benefits and risks and decide what is right for you.

, If you prefer a private consultation, seek advice from your local physician. Contact a hospital and ask to speak with a urologist to get a second opinion on the potential benefits and risks, and to get a description of the procedure and the recovery.


For a teenager or an adult, circumcision is typically performed under anaesthetic and takes about two weeks for recovery.
Some hospitals will not perform circumcisions on adults unless there is a medical reason. If you're committed to getting circumcised, be prepared to shop around for a place to get the procedure done.

, Make sure you've got some time set aside for recovery, which can take up to two weeks. If you're getting circumcised for religious reasons, use the time leading up to the procedure to complete any rituals associated with it. Consult members of your religious community for advice and guidance.

, Cover the genital area with waterproof covering during the first few days, when taking a shower or bathing, and keep the area very clean when using the restroom. The wound needs to be kept dry to facilitate quick healing.


Your doctor will offer more specific instructions and topical medication, but in general you'll want to keep the area as clean and dry as possible.

, Change your underwear throughout the day to keep the area very clean. Also wear loose fitting clothing around the area to keep air circulating regularly. Avoid tight fitting jeans, and consider some cotton short pants or other loose clothing.

, The doctor will probably prescribe analgesic cream or other topical ointments, and apply them regularly as directed. You may also want to add some petroleum jelly to the area to avoid chafing during your recovery.

, It's common practice in American hospitals for babies to be circumcised within the first few days of birth, completing the procedure when recovery will be quick and relatively painless. Consider whether or not you'd like to leave the decision up to the child, or have it done in the hospital.


Often, parents will make this decision so the child will look like the father or brothers, to avoid confusion as the child grows up.
Talk to your obstetrician and pediatrician. In general, the procedure will be done quickly and will recover relatively simple cleaning for the baby to recover.

, Avoid using wipes or other cleaning solutions and sponge bathe the baby with warm soapy water for the first several days.


Some pediatricians recommend keeping the penis covered, while some recommend leaving it uncovered to heal. If you want to wrap a little gauze around the penis, dab some petroleum jelly on it first to avoid painful snags., The Bris is typically done not at the hospital but at a separate location. To arrange a Bris, talk to your rabbi or other religious advisor.

Testosterone is commonly prescribed to treat hypogonadism in men - a condition that develops when the testes don't function correctly.However, this is far from the only reason why someone might want testosterone. Below are just a few other reasons:


Testosterone is sometimes given to transgender people as part of their gender affirmation and transition.
Some women receive testosterone as a treatment for androgen deficiency, which can occur after menopause. The most common symptom of androgen deficiency in women is decreased libido.Finally, some men seek testosterone treatment to counteract the normal effects of decreased testosterone production that results with aging. However, this practice is still not well-studied, so many physicians advise against it. Some of the studies that have been done have given mixed results.;
, Injection is a commonly-used means of administering testosterone to a patient. However, there are actually a wide range of alternative methods for getting testosterone in to the body, some of which may be preferable to certain patients. These include:Topical gel or cream
Skin patch (similar to a nicotine patch)






Oral tablets
Mucoadhesive applied to the teeth
Testosterone stick (applied under the arm like deodorant)
Subcutaneous implant

, Because testosterone is a hormone that can cause significant changes in your body's function, it is known to exacerbate or worsen certain medical conditions. Testosterone should not be administered if a patient suffers from prostate cancer or breast cancer. All patients considering testosterone treatment should receive a prostate exam and a screening for prostate-specific-antigen (PSA) before and after therapy to make sure prostate cancer is not present., Testosterone is a fairly powerful hormone. Even with safe, doctor-monitored use, it can have noticeable side effects. The most common side effects from testosterone treatment are:Acne and/or oily skin
Fluid retention
Stimulation of prostate tissue, which can result in decreased urine flow and frequency
Development of breast tissue






Worsening of sleep apnea
Shrinking of the testes
Decreased sperm count/infertility
Increase in red blood cell count






Changes in cholesterol levels

, Like any serious medical treatment, the decision to receive testosterone treatment shouldn't be made lightly. Seek the advice of your doctor before proceeding - s/he will be able to help you assess your condition and goals to determine whether testosterone is right for you.

, Testosterone for injection is usually in the form of testosterone cypionate or testosterone enanthate. These liquids come in multiple concentrations, so before giving an injection, it’s very important to make sure that your intended dosage takes into account the concentration of the testosterone serum. Usually, testosterone comes in a concentration of either 100 mg/ml or 200 mg/ml. In other words, some doses of testosterone are twice as concentrated as others. Double check your testosterone before you give an injection to make sure you have the right dosage for the concentration you've chosen.

, As with all injections, it’s tremendously important to use a sterile, never-before-used needle when administering testosterone. Dirty needles can spread deadly blood-borne diseases like hepatitis and HIV. Use a clean, sealed, capped needle every time you give a testosterone injection.


Another thing to consider is the fact that testosterone is fairly viscous and oily compared to other injectable medications. Because of this, you’ll want to initially use a slightly thicker-bore needle than normal (for instance, a 18 or 20-gauge) to draw up your dose. Thick needles can be especially painful, so, usually, you’ll remove the thicker needle and replace it with a thinner one when it comes time to give the actual injection.
3-ml (cc) syringes will be large enough for most testosterone doses.
If you drop the syringe or needle, throw it away. Do not use it because it is no longer sterile.

, To reduce the risk of infection, it’s important to keep your hands clean when giving an injection. Wash your hands thoroughly with antibacterial soap and water, then put on clean gloves. If you accidentally touch any unsanitized objects or surfaces before giving the injection, replace your gloves as a safety measure.

, Your doctor will have given you a recommended dose - determine the volume of your dose in relation to the concentration of your testosterone. For instance, if your doctor recommends a dose of 100 mg, you’ll want 1 ml of a 100 mg/ml testosterone solution or ½ ml of a 200 mg/ml solution. To draw up your dose, first draw air into your syringe equal to the volume of your dosage. Then, wipe the top of the medication bottle with an alcohol wipe, insert your needle through the lid and into the medication, and push the air from your syringe into the bottle. Turn the bottle upside down and draw out the exact dosage of testosterone.


Injecting air into the bottle raises its internal air pressure, making it easier to draw the medication into the syringe. This is especially important with testosterone, which can be difficult to draw because it’s so thick.

, Thick needles can be fairly painful. There’s no need to subject yourself to this extra pain, especially if you’re on a program that calls for frequent injections. To switch to a smaller needle once you’ve drawn up your dose, remove the needle from the bottle and hold it point-up in front of you. Draw a small amount of air - this is to put space between the medicine and the top of the syringe so that you don’t spill. Using the (washed and gloved) hand that’s not holding the syringe, carefully re-cap and unscrew the needle, then replace it with a thinner one (like a 23-gauge).


Note that the second needle must also be sealed and sterile.

, Injecting air bubbles into a person’s body can cause a serious medical condition called an embolism. Because of this, it’s very important to ensure there are no air bubbles in the syringe when you inject the testosterone. Do this via a process called aspiration. See below for instructions:


Hold the syringe with its needle uncapped and pointing up in front of you.
Look for air bubbles in the syringe. Flick the side of the syringe to get these bubbles to rise to the top.
When your dosage is bubble-free, slowly depress the plunger to force the air at the top of the syringe out. Stop when you see a tiny drop of medication come out of the tip of the syringe. Be careful not to squirt or spray a significant portion of your dosage onto the floor.

, Testosterone injections are typically intramuscular - that is, given directly into a muscle. Two relatively easy and accessible sites for intramuscular injection are the vastus lateralis (top outside region of the thigh) or the glut (upper back portion of the thigh, ie, the butt cheek). These aren’t the only places that testosterone can be injected, but they are by far the most common. Whichever of these sites you choose, take a sterile alcohol pad and wipe the immediate area around where you intend to inject. This will kill bacteria on the skin, preventing infection.


If injecting into the glute, choose an injection site in the top outside section of the glute. In other words, pick a site either in the top left corner of the left glute or the top right corner of the right glute. These site have the best access to muscle tissue and allow you to avoid hitting nerves and blood vessels in other parts of the glute.

, Hold your loaded syringe like a dart at a 90 degree angle above the sterile injection site. Quickly plunge it into the flesh using one quick, steady motion. Before depressing the plunger, draw back on it slightly. If you draw blood into the syringe, remove the needle and choose a different spot, as this means you’ve hit a vein. Inject the medication at a steady, controlled pace.


You may experience moderate discomfort, pressure, stinging, pressure, or slight burning. This is normal. If it becomes severe or if you feel shooting pain, stop immediately, and contact a doctor.

, Once you have fully depressed the plunger, slowly pull the needle out. Assess the needle entry point for bleeding, and apply a sterile band-aid and/or a clean cotton ball if needed. Dispose of the used needle and syringe in a proper sharps container.


If you do not have a sharps container, find a sturdy, puncture-proof container, such as a laundry detergent bottle. Make sure that it has a tight-fitting lid. Take the container to your doctor's office or a pharmacy to be safely disposed of.If, after injection, you experience redness, swelling, or discomfort beyond that of normal soreness at the site of injection, contact a physician immediately.

Reposition yourself.,
Put your hands in your pockets.,
Cover your crotch region with something.,
Do the tuck.,
Create a huge distraction.,
Distract yourself.,
Take a walk.,
Put something cold into your lap.,
Find an excuse to go to the restroom.,
Whatever you do, don't get it more excited.",How to Get Rid of an Unwanted Erection," Whether you're sitting down or standing up, there's usually a chance to position yourself in such a way to hide what's going on down there.



Standing up: Try not to face to the side of anyone. A bulge in the crotch region is a lot less noticeable if you're facing someone head on than it is from the side.

Sitting down: Try casually crossing your legs. When men cross their legs, the pant material in the crotch region usually gets bunched up, offering cover to your mischievous main vain.;
, Putting your hands in your pockets is a perfectly natural gesture, making this very popular. Put both of your hands in your pockets so as not to arouse suspicion, and gently hold the erection close to your body, trying not to move so as to tame your member into timidity.

, Maybe you have no pockets in your pants (although men should always have pockets in their pants), or it's impossible to reposition yourself. In this case, look for something to put over your crotch region to hide your excitement. Try covering yourself with:


A book or a magazine. Pretend to lose yourself in an interesting article (just make sure you don't pick up Cosmo or you could blow your cover) and place the book or magazine over your lap.
A table. If you're sitting down, casually move your seat up as close as possible to the table.
A piece of clothing. If you've got a jacket or sweater, pretend to look for something in the jacket pocket, and then casually leave it in your lap.

, Basically, tuck your erection under your belt, from inside your pockets, using your hands. Warning: Only the most experienced tuckers can do this maneuver while facing a group of people. It's much better to find an excuse to be alone, or turn away from the group, and quickly do the tuck while no one can see. Tuckers with longer penises should make sure their upper garments are both opaque and securely occluding the entire glans.

, Again, this is only for the most experienced men, as creating a poor distraction could actually focus the attention on you, with potentially disastrous results.


When the time is right, say something like: ""Wow, look at that man who's juggling cute little puppies while riding on a unicycle in the distance!"" and run away when everyone's turned their heads.

, It's much easier said than done, but if you can find a way to distract yourself, you are halfway home. Get your mind focused on something important, irreverent, or just plain weird. The idea is that it's hard to actually think and have an erection at the same time. (Women have known this for centuries.)


Think about something really important. If you're older, maybe there's bills to pay, or deadlines to worry about. If you're younger, try thinking about your parents; it's a guaranteed boner-buster.
Think about something irreverent. Irreverent means not taking things seriously. Try picturing something really funny.
Think about something weird. The weirder the better. Some people think of cobwebs, or clowns, or maybe even the irreconcilable vastness of the universe. It could do the trick.

, When you walk, your body is forced to pump blood to your limbs in order to get them moving. That's why taking a nice little stroll could relieve you of your unwanted erection. Try mumbling something to your peers about obscure economic policy and walk away into the distance. The girls will think you're really mysterious.

, Most people don't walk around with ice cubes or ice packs, so it could be tough to work this one. But cold objects will constrict the blood flow to your Johnson, making it a lot less excited.

, Or just go to the restroom without offering an excuse; that could be less weird. When you're at the restroom, wash cold water on your face or do jumping jacks if no one else is there. Think about someone you know who may or may not be the least good-looking person in town.

, Don't rub it against your hand or another object, don't picture someone who is evenly mildly attractive, and don't fixate on your uncomfortable situation. Your discomfort will go away soon if you complete all these steps.

You will find that as your weight goes down your self-confidence will go up. Because a fitness boot camp program is so challenging and difficult, finishing one will definitely give you the self-confidence you need in tackling other obstacles that you have in your life outside your fitness issues.

Find out if you have obstructive or nonobstructive azoospermia.,
Have two sperm samples analyzed.,
Get an ultrasound, MRI, or CT scan.,
Discuss your medical history with your doctor.",How to Improve Azoospermia1," The first step to treating azoospermia is to visit a urologist or fertility specialist. They can help you find out whether your condition is obstructive or nonobstructive. Both types of azoospermia are easily treatable, but treatment options vary widely:Obstructive azoospermia, in which there’s a blockage in the reproductive tract, can be treated surgically.
Nonobstructive azoospermia is often related to a hormonal imbalance and treated with oral or injected hormones.
Other causes of nonobstructive azoospermia include medications, chemotherapy, and recreational drugs. In these cases, the reproductive system often recovers on its own in a little time.;
, Have your urologist or fertility specialist analyze two samples at two different times. These tests will determine the number of viable, motile sperm the sample contains.The tests will help rule out other issues, like low sperm motility or low sperm count (as opposed to a lack of sperm, which occurs in azoospermia).
Testing two samples will help account for your body’s natural variability.

, In order to detect obstructive azoospermia, your doctor will need to take some images of your insides. They’ll take an ultrasound, MRI, or CT scan of your reproductive system and look for any abnormalities. There's no need to worry, as these are all easy, painless procedures that will help your doctor come up with the best treatment.The type of imaging scan will depend on your specialist’s preferences and your insurance coverage. To verify your coverage, contact your insurer and ask if a procedure is covered or if it requires prior approval.

, Be open and honest with your doctor. They want to give you the best care possible! Let them know about the medications, even over the counter, you regularly take, about any recreational drugs you use, whether you’ve ever had a sexually transmitted infection, and whether you’ve ever received chemotherapy or radiation therapy.If you have cystic fibrosis, ask if you might have a related congenital deformity that affects the reproductive tract. Around 95% of men with cystic fibrosis have a congenital reproductive tract deformity."

If you aren't already working out regularly, try to fit at least four workout sessions into your weekly schedule. You can do even more if you like, as long as you give yourself a chance to rest and recuperate. Your path to bigness starts on your calendar — devote plenty of time to your goal, and you'll see results.


There's no single ""best"" workout — what works for one person may not work for another. Many health resources recommend workouts of about 30 minutes to an hour. As long as you stay on task, this should be plenty of time — however, some people prefer longer, less intense workouts.The workout schedule above should work for most people. However, it's far from the only workout plan out there. There are a huge variety of workout plans available for free online — all it takes is a simple search engine query to find plenty of good ones.

, Getting big muscles means spending lots of time doing resistance training. To many people, this basically means ""lifting weights."" This is a great way to put on muscle, but this isn't actually the only way to do resistance training. For example, bodyweight exercises (like pushups, lunges, and so on) and exercise bands are two other ways to build muscles. Regardless of the exact exercise routine you use, a strong focus on challenging resistance training should lead to muscle growth.


Traditional weightlifting wisdom is that performing high weight, low rep exercises tend to increase muscle size, while performing low weight, high rep exercises tend to increase muscle tone. However, recent research seems to suggest that as long as you work to the point of fatigue, you should build muscle with either strategy., Cardio training — activities like running, cycling, jogging, swimming, elliptical training, and so on — isn't bad for you. In fact, it's great for you and is known to have many physical and mental health benefits.However, when you're trying to build muscle, putting a heavy focus on cardio can sometimes be like shooting yourself in the foot. Cardio exercise takes lots of time and energy and won't necessarily give you the sorts of big, bulky muscles you're looking for, so the time you spend doing cardio can often be better spent doing resistance training. Aim to spend no more than a day or two per week on cardio training.


One good way to manage the amount of cardio you do is to reserve cardio for your ""off"" days — that is, the days when you don't have any resistance training scheduled. This way, you don't waste any time that you would have spent building muscle on cardio.

, Having trouble sticking to your workout routine? Stay motivated by joining a group of people who are also dedicated to their own workouts! Becoming part of a group doesn't just give you people to talk with your struggles, joys, and victories with — it also makes it harder to slack off because your team members will hold you accountable for it!If you can find people to work out with you in your friends or family, great! If not, consider joining an exercise class at your local gym — it's a great opportunity to meet someone!
Alternatively, consider getting in touch with an exercise meetup group. These are groups of people who coordinate online to meet at gyms and exercise together. A simple search for ""Fitness meetup (your city name)"" should yield decent results.

, The time you don't spend exercising is just as important as the time you do spend exercising when it comes to building muscle. If you don't give yourself time to rest, your body won't be able to rebuild your muscles as effectively after you break them down through exercise. Remember, building big muscles takes patience, so don't overdo it — give your muscles at least one day a week without exercise.


In addition, you'll want to make sure to get a full night's sleep after each exercise session. Human growth hormones (the chemicals that help you build muscle) are at their highest levels when you sleep, so neglecting to get a good night's rest after a workout is essentially robbing yourself of muscle gains., Protein is the name of the game when it comes to building muscle — it's what your body uses to construct new, stronger muscle fibers out of your old ones. For this reason, anyone aiming to get big should make sure they're eating enough lean protein. Workout resources generally recommend about 40-60 grams of protein for most adults' meals (more if you are exceptionally large already.)For the most muscle-building benefit in the smallest caloric package, try to prioritize lean protein sources. A few examples include:

White meat chicken
Leaner cuts of pork and beef
Beans
Lentils
Tofu, soy, etc.
Egg whites
Low-fat dairy products



, Carbohydrates get a bad rap today, but truthfully they're absolutely vital for a healthy, energetic lifestyle.Whole-wheat carbohydrates provide filling, long-lasting energy that keeps you going throughout the day (including during your workout. Most workout resources recommend eating about 40-80 grams of carbohydrates per meal.Carbohydrates made from whole-wheat grains are preferable to those that aren't — whole wheat products incorporate the entire kernel of wheat, which contains more nutrients and protein than ""white"" breads and the like, which tend to go heavy on sugar. Examples of healthy carbs include:

Whole wheat breads, pastas, crackers, etc.
Brown rice
Quinoa
Steel-cut or old-fashioned oats
Beans and legumes


In addition, most fruits and vegetables qualify as healthy carbohydrates (especially green leafy vegetables) and are rich in vitamins and minerals.

, Contrary to popular belief, ""fat"" is not a dirty word in the world of fitness. In fact, consuming a small amount of fat each day is a great way to build up a small, healthy reserve of energy (which can be a big help during a tough workout.) It's important, however, to moderate your fat intake — you'll only need about 5-10 grams per meal.Some sources of fat are healthier than others. Avoid processed fats, which you'll usually find in snack foods and which tend to lack nutrients. Instead, try one of these healthy fat sources:

Dairy products
Nuts
Avocados
Most fish (also a good source of protein)
Eggs



, If you know people who take weightlifting seriously, odds are that you've seen them drinking a concoction that looks a little like chocolate milk to get bigger. This is usually a powdered protein supplement like whey, casein or creatine. While these products typically contain more protein than the body would ordinarily need, they can be useful in situations when extra protein is needed, like:When starting a new routine
When exercising very heavily
When you're growing (i.e., if you're a teenager)
When recovering from an injury
When you can't get protein from other sources (i.e., if you're vegan)

Note, however, that taking lots more protein than you need over a long period of time is not recommended, as it can tax your liver., If you're looking to get big, working out should be a major part of your life. However, it shouldn't be the only part of your life. Pushing yourself too hard won't just leave you tired, unmotivated, and unhappy — if you don't get enough rest, it will also make it harder for you to put on muscle. Most important of all, several over-exercise can lead to several dangerous health conditions, including:Pulled muscles, torn ligaments, etc.
Joint pain
Spinal problems
Very rarely, heart attack, stroke, or aneurysm (if predisposed to these conditions.)
Rhabdomyolysis (life-threatening; if you experience extreme muscle soreness and dark urine, contact a doctor immediately)

, When you start a muscle-building routine, the sudden spike in your energy levels may leave you with an increased appetite, so it may be tempting to simply ""pig out"" and eat whatever you want. Don't give in — you can increase your caloric intake somewhat, but increasing it too much will leave you with a big surplus of calories that your body will convert to fat. Over a long period of time, this can make you ""big,"" though not in the sense you probably wanted, so try to keep your natural urge to eat more in check.


In general, you'll feel fullest if you stick to a diet of lean proteins, whole wheat grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats (as recommended above.) On the other hand, processed snacks won't usually ""fill you up"" in the long term. This means that sticking to a healthy, natural diet will usually keep you from overeating (though it's certainly possible to eat too much of foods that are healthy.
To keep your eating under control, try using a calorie counting application like the one at MyFitnessPal.com., If you desperately want big muscles, it may be tempting at times to use certain illegal shortcuts to reach this goal. Resist this urge. Steroid and other illicit exercise aids may seem to get quick results, but they're not worth the associated health risks, which, depending on the drug, can be quite serious. For example, anabolic steroids are known to cause these health issues:High blood pressure
Increased risk of heart attack and stroke
Liver disease
Baldness
Oily skin and acne
(In men) lowered sperm count, infertility, shrunken testicles, enlarged breasts
(In women) increased body hair, enlarged clitoris, deepened voice, shrunken breasts

Prepare an ice pack.,
Wrap the ice pack in a towel or cloth.,
Find a comfortable place for your treatment.,
Place the ice pack on your back.,
Combine ice with a pain reliever.,
Continue treatment for a few days.,
See your doctor.",How to Apply Ice to Relieve Back Pain1," If you are experiencing back pain and want to use an ice pack to relieve it, you can either make an ice pack or purchase one. From commercial packs to bags of frozen vegetables, any choice you make can help you alleviate discomfort and reduce inflammation.You can purchase commercial ice packs specifically designed for the back at many pharmacies and medical supply stores.
Make a slushy ice pack by pouring three cups (710 ml) of water and one cup (237 ml) of denatured alcohol in a large freezer bag. Wrap it inside another freezer bag to avoid spilling. Place it in the freezer until it is a slushy consistency.
You can put small ice cubes or crushed ice in a plastic bag to make an ice pack.
You can also use a bag of frozen vegetables, which may nicely fit the contours of your back.;
, Before you apply your ice pack, wrap it in a towel or cloth. Not only can this keep you from getting wet and keep the pack in place, but may also protect your skin from becoming numb or getting ice burn or even frostbite.It’s especially important to wrap a commercial blue ice pack in a towel. These are colder than frozen water and can cause frostbite., You want to be comfortable while you ice your back. Finding a comfortable place where you can lie or sit can help you relax, relieve discomfort, and get the full benefits of icing.


It may be easier to lie down while icing your back. However, if you work, this might not be practical. You can place an ice pack on a chair and hold it in place by wedging it between your back and the chair back.

, Once you’re comfortable, place the ice pack on the area of your back that is causing you pain. This may offer you some immediate pain relief and reduce inflammation that is exacerbating your discomfort.Keep the pack on the affected area for no more than 20 minutes per session.Less than 10 minutes may be ineffective but too much time can cause damage, so shoot for 15-20 minutes. Doing it for longer than 20 minutes can damage skin (cryoburn) and underlying tissues.You can use the ice pack after activity or exercise, but don’t use it beforehand. This may prevent your brain from receiving important pain signals to stop.If your pack doesn’t cover the entire area causing you pain, you can do spot ice treatments to get relief.
You can also use elastic wrap or shrink wrap to hold the pack in place., Try taking an over-the-counter pain reliever along with your ice treatments. Using this combination may relieve your pain more quickly and also help control inflammation.Take acetaminophen, ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen sodium to help relieve your back pain.NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen sodium may also help relieve inflammation., Ice is most effective for back pain in the days immediately following when you first notice pain. Keep applying the ice until you no longer have pain, or see a doctor if it persists.You can ice your back up to five times a day with at least 45 minutes in between treatments.The continued icing keeps your tissue temperatures low and may help reduce inflammation and pain., Consult with your doctor if icing doesn’t help after a week or your pain becomes unbearable. She may be able to treat the pain more effectively and quickly, and can also identify any underlying causes that may be causing you discomfort.

Know what causes a blocked teardrop.,
Recognize the symptoms of a blocked tear duct.,
See your doctor for a diagnosis.,
Cleanse the area often.,
Apply a warm compress to promote drainage.,
Try lacrimal sac massages to unblock the duct.,
Place breast milk in the eyes to kill bacteria.,
Take oral antibiotics to fight tear duct infection.,
Use antibiotic eye drops instead of oral medications.,
Have the blocked tear duct probed and irrigated.,
Consider intubation treatment.,
Undergo surgery as a last resort.",How to Clear a Blocked Tear Duct," A blocked tear duct (also known as dacryocystitis) happens when there is an obstruction in the passageway that connects the eyes to the nose. This is most common in newborn babies, but it can also happen to adults as a result of infection, injury or tumor. Here are the common causes:Congenital blockage, which happens often in newborns
Age-related changes
Infections in the eye
Trauma to the face
Tumors
Cancer treatments;
, The most common symptom is increased tearing in the eye. These tears may overflow to the face. When suffering from a blocked tear duct, tears may be a little bit thicker than normal and crust over as they dry. Other symptoms include:


Recurrent eye inflammation
Blurred vision
Mucus or pus-like discharge in the eye lids

, Physical examination by a medical professional is required in order to diagnose a blocked tear duct. While simple inflammation might be causing the blockage, it could also be a tumor or another serious medical problem, so it's important to see your doctor.


To test for a blocked tear duct, the doctor will flush out the eye using a dyed liquid. If the tears do not flow normally, and you can taste the liquid and feel it dripping down the back of the throat, this is a good indication that there is a blockage in the tear ducts.
The doctor will also ask you to describe your symptoms, which are of great clinical value as they can help to rule out other eye conditions like congenital conjunctivitis and glaucoma.

, Use a clean washcloth and warm water to wipe away the drainage several times a day, so it doesn't interfere with vision. This is especially important if the drainage is being caused by an infection that could spread to the other eye., A warm compress can open it up and allow it to drain more easily. Press the warm compress against the top of the tear duct for three to five minutes, up to five times a day until the blockage clears.


To make a warm compress, you can use a warm, damp towel or dip a cotton ball in warm water or chamomile tea (which has soothing properties).
Make sure the warm compress isn't too hot, or it could cause redness and pain.

, Lacrimal sac massage can be used to open up the tear duct and encourage drainage. Your doctor may show you how to perform this massage on yourself or on your baby to clear a tear duct. To perform the massage, place the index fingers at the inner corners of the eyes, close to the sides of the nose.


Apply pressure to this spot for several seconds, then release. Repeat this 3 to 5 times per day.
Always remember to wash your hands before performing a lacrimal sac massage, as you don't want to risk introducing bacteria to the eyes and causing an infection.

, This method is effective for babies with blocked tear ducts. Breast milk contains antimicrobial properties that help to fight off infection in the blocked tear duct, while also lubricating the eye and minimizing irritation.Place a few drops of breast milk onto your index finger, then allow it to drip into the baby's affected eye. You can do this up to six times per day.
Again, it's very important that you wash your hands thoroughly before doing this, to avoid introducing bacteria to the baby's eyes.

, Oral antibiotics will be prescribed to help with the blocked tear duct if the cause of the blocked duct is infection. Antibiotics are substances that are used to inhibit the growth of bacteria in a specific area of the body.


Erythromycin is the most common drug used for a blocked tear duct. This drug prevents bacteria from growing and multiplying, by interfering with the bacteria's protein-making cycle.
The usual dosage of erythromycin is one 250mg tablet four times daily. However, this will vary according to the severity of the infection and the age of the patient, so follow your doctor's instructions.

, For less serious infection, antibiotic eye drops are sometimes prescribed instead or oral antibiotics.


To use the eye drops, shake the bottle well, tilt your head back, then place the recommended number of drops into the eye. Close the eye for 30 seconds to a minute to allow the eye drops to be absorbed.
Always wash your hands before using eye drops to avoid introducing bacteria to the eye. After applying the eyes drops, wash the hands again.
For children, the instruction is the same, but the assistance of another adult will be needed to prevent the child from moving.

, Dilation, probing and irrigation is a minimally invasive treatment that can also be done to clear a blocked tear duct. This procedure is done under general anesthesia and takes about 30 minutes.


The procedure is performed by dilating the puncta (the two little holes in the eyelid) with a tiny metal dilating tool. After that, a probe is moved through the passage way until it reaches the nose. When the probe reaches the nose the passage is irrigated using a sterile liquid.
If you (or your child) are set to receive this treatment, it's important that you avoid taking aspirin or ibuprofen in the two weeks before the surgery, as it could lead to bleeding.

, Intubation is another minimally invasive treatment option. Similar to probing and irrigation, its goal is to open the blockage in the tear duct. General anaesthesia is given to the patient to make him or her sleep.


During the procedure, a thin tube is then inserted through the tear sac at the corners of the eyes until it reaches the nose. This tube is then left in the duct for three to four months to allow the tear duct to drain and prevent it from getting blocked again.
The tube itself is barely noticeable, but after the surgery certain precautions must be taken to prevent infection. You must avoid rubbing your eyes in case you move or damage the tube and you must always remember to wash your hands before touching your eyes.

, Surgery is the last treatment option. When the tear duct cannot be unblocked using one of the methods described above, it needs to be removed entirely in a procedure known as a dacryocystorhinostomy.


A dacryocystorhinostom is done by creating a bypass communication between the tear duct and the nose, which allows the tears to drain.
A fistula is then inserted in the duct, serving as the passage way of the tears.

Identify the range of motion that causes your knee pain.,
Fine tune the exact range of motion that causes you pain.,
Avoid the range of motion that causes you pain.

,
For knee pain at the top or bottom ranges, continue your routine as normal and write in your log that, if you are avoiding the top range, your exercise is ""non-lockout"".

,
For knee pain at the middle range, split your exercise in two and do the top and bottom range.,
Exercise in a gym.,
Get a power rack to do your squats and deadlifts.,
Build your equipment such as ""blocks"" or use heavy chains.,
Try doing singles like competitive lifters.",How to Boost Your Testosterone Level when You Have Knee Pain," Is it at the top, middle or bottom?;
, The ranges of motion are in thirds, so for example if your knee pain is in the top range: find out what part of the top range hurts your knee.

,,,

If you are doing a deadlift, write in your log ""Deadlift Breaks"". With the deadlift breaks, lift the barbell off the floor and inch or two or three and lower it to the floor for whatever set rep scheme you prefer.






Again doing a deadlift, write in your log ""Deadlift from mid-thigh"". Your bottom position will be mid-thigh and your end position will be when you are standing and with your shoulder pulled back.







, This would be fast and easy.

, Although your testosterone can be boosted with other exercises such as Olympic lifting, Strongman events, short duration drills of 20 seconds or less and 100 meter (328.1 ft) sprints - squats and deadlifts are more practical and safer to do.

, Get your ideas from others, the internet, books and especially from old strength magazines. Read about Paul Anderson and the creative ways he trained.

, However, with the low reps you must use heavier weights and with heavier weights your technique must be more correct.

Stop taking a medication or recreational drug.,
Have an obstruction surgically removed.,
Take hormones to treat nonobstructive azoospermia.,
Ask your specialist if they recommend varicocelectomy.,
Ask if sperm retrieval is your best option.",How to Improve Azoospermia2," If you take a medication that interferes with sperm production, ask your doctor to help you find an alternative. If you take recreational drugs, try to stop using them. While chemo and radiation therapies can interfere with sperm production, the reproductive system often recovers within two to three months after treatment.It's best not to stop taking a medication without talking to your doctor first.
Have your sperm analyzed again around three months after switching medications, stopping drug use, or finishing chemo or radiation therapy.

, If your specialist tracks down a blockage, chances are high that it can be surgically repaired without complications.Depending on the obstruction’s location, your urologist can perform one of two routine, minimally invasive procedures:Microsurgery, which involves a small incision that's used to repair the parts that connect the testes to the rest of the reproductive tract.
Endoscopic surgery, which involves a small, flexible tube used to repair the urethra and ejaculatory duct.

, Hormone and blood screenings can detect nonobstructive azoospermia that's caused by a hormone imbalance. Your specialist will prescribe an oral or injectable hormone regimen. Cases involving hormonal imbalance have a high recovery rate, and natural pregnancy is often possible., Varicoceles, or enlarged veins on the scrotum, can cause nonobstructive azoospermia. Ask your urologist if they recommend varicocelectomy, which is a procedure that can repair the problematic veins.Sperm counts increase in nearly half of men who undergo varicocelectomy.

, You can still try sperm retrieval if surgical or hormonal treatments are unsuccessful or aren’t options. Prior to retrieval, you'll take hormones to help your body produce more viable sperm. After a few months, your fertility specialist will extract sperm from the testes to use for in vitro fertilization."

Get a referral from your doctor or insurer.,
Use a urological association’s search tool.,
Look for a urologist experienced in infertility and microsurgery.,
Check their experience and credentials.,
Evaluate their communication styles.",How to Improve Azoospermia3," Word of mouth is great way to track down a good doctor or specialist. Ask your primary care doctor to refer you to a reputable urologist in your area. You can also call your insurance company and have them provide you with a list of local urologists in your network.While it might a sensitive topic, you can also ask friends or family members to recommend a urologist.

, National urological boards and associations often offer convenient search tools that can help you track down a urologist in your area. For example, you can visit the ""Find a Urologist"" page on the American Urological Association’s website. Their search tool allows you to enter your zip code and filter results by distance and specialty.In the specialty drop down menu, you’d select ""fertility"" to find an appropriate local urologist.

, Search for the websites of potential urologists’ private practices, or look for their listings at the hospitals or medical institutions at which they practice. Try to track down urologists who specialize in male infertility and who routinely perform microsurgical procedures.You can also call their private practice or medical institution and ask about their experience. Ask, “How many microsurgeries does this urologist perform per year? Do they have experience treating azoospermia and other infertility issues?”

, Enter prospective urologists into a search engine to find patient reports and reviews. You can also contact your local better business bureau or chamber of commerce to find out if they have a history of poor business practices.Online reviews aren’t always objective and authoritative, so take them with a grain of salt.

, You'll definitely want to get a feel for a doctor's bedside manner before signing on for long-term care. Call a prospective urologist’s office and ask if you can speak with the doctor. Choose one who takes the time to talk to you about your condition, communicates clearly, and doesn’t try to rush or dismiss you.Gauging any doctor’s bedside manner is essential, especially when choosing a specialist to treat a potentially sensitive issue like infertility.

Fashion or buy an ice massager.,
Ask a friend or family member to help you.,
Assume a relaxed position.,
Expose the ice massager.,
Rub the ice massager over the affected area.,
Repeat ice massages.,
Take pain medication to bolster ice massage.,
Schedule an appointment with your doctor.",How to Apply Ice to Relieve Back Pain2," Some studies have shown that ice massage may penetrate muscle fiber more quickly and may help you heal more effectively than an ice pack. You can either make or buy an ice massager to help relieve your discomfort.Make your own ice massager by filling a paper or Styrofoam cup about three-quarters full of cool water. Place this cup on a flat surface in your freezer until it is a solid block of ice.Make several ice massagers at one time so that you don’t have to wait for water to freeze each time you want to ice your back.
You can also use ice cubes as ice massagers.Some companies are making commercial ice massagers, which you can purchase at some pharmacies and sports stores., Although you may be able to reach the area of your back causing you pain, it may be easier to have a friend or family member help you. This can help you to relax and get the most benefit from an ice massage.

, Either sit or lie in a relaxed and comfortable position while you use ice massage. This can help you more effectively receive the ice treatment and may help relieve your pain faster.


If you are at home, it may be easier to lie down to do the ice massage.
If you are at work, you may want to sit on the floor of your office space or cubicle, or at the front of your chair if that is comfortable.

, Peel away part of the frozen cup so that approximately two inches (five cm) of ice showing. This can expose enough ice to massage your sore back while keeping a barrier between your hand so that it doesn’t get cold or frostbite.


As the ice melts during your massage, keep peeling away the cup.

, Once you’ve exposed the frozen ice in the cup, begin gently massaging it over the area of your back causing you pain. This can help to penetrate deep into your muscle tissue and start to relieve pain quickly.


Rub the ice massager in a gentle, circular pattern across your back.Massage the affected region for eight to 10 minutes per session.You can use ice massage up to five times per day.

, Continue to give yourself ice massages for a few days. This can help ensure that the treatments are effective and may help relieve your pain and any inflammation.Ice is most effective when used over the course of a few days., Consider taking over-the-counter pain relievers to help bolster the pain relief and anti-inflammatory effects of ice massage. This may help you get relief faster and heal faster as well.


You can use any number of pain relievers including aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and naproxen sodium.NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, aspirin, and naproxen sodium can minimize swelling and inflammation that exacerbates pain., If your back pain continues following a few days of icing treatments, make an appointment to see your doctor. She may be able to identify underlying conditions or give you stronger treatments to alleviate the pain.

Get up and move around.,
Correct your sleeping position.,
Make your environments at home, work, and in your car ergonomic.,
Stretch and exercise.,
Lift with your legs.",How to Avoid Worsening Persistent Back Pain1," Research has shown that sitting too long can not only contribute to back problems, but is bad for your health in general.Don’t stay seated for long periods of time, whether at home or at a desk job. A common risk factor for back pain is a sedentary lifestyle. Take a few minutes to stretch and walk around at least once per hour. Unless your doctor prescribes a day or two of bedrest, don't stay in bed or lay down all day., Sleeping improperly significantly aggravates chronic back problems. Harmful positions include sleeping on your stomach and in the fetal position. It’s recommended to sleep on your back with a pillow under your knees or on your side with your knees pulled up slightly toward your chest, with a pillow tucked between them. It’s best not to sleep with too many pillows under your neck., Set yourself up for success with ergonomic chairs, lumbar support pillows, and by positioning your computer monitor at eye level.Pay attention to your posture, especially when you’re in one position for a while, like driving or sitting at a desk doing work. When seated, keep your knees a bit higher up than your hips, and while standing, keep your head up, stomach in, and shoulders pulled back.Physically strenuous work can lead to back pain or make back pain worse. However, psychologically strenuous work can also lead to back pain.
Back pain is a leading cause of Worker’s Compensation Claims.

, Stretching and strengthening exercises are beneficial for long-term back pain. Swimming, yoga, aerobics, and other appropriate exercise regimens that include low-impact, repetitive physical movements can improve flexibility and strengthen core muscles.Further, exercise can help you to maintain a healthy body weight or help you lose weight, which decreases stress on your back.

, Never bend over from your waist and lift heavy objects using the muscles of your back. Rather, bend your knees, squat, pull in your stomach muscles, and keep your gaze straight ahead. Hold the object as close as you can to your body. Never twist your body while you’re lifting something, and take frequent breaks when performing manual labor."

Admit when you don't have answers.",How to Understand Someone With Chronic Pain," Each chronic pain sufferer’s experience is unique. It may be helpful if they talk about the condition and their daily battle with pain. The more you know about what the chronic pain sufferer is going through, the more you will be able to understand what it’s like for them.


Did they suffer from a sprained back, serious infection or is there an ongoing cause of pain such as arthritis, diabetic neuropathy, or some other form of nerve damage? Know when the pain started, and do some research or read stories about people with similar issues.
Sometimes doctors cannot find the source of the pain. It’s just present.
Don’t push a chronic pain sufferer to talk about things they don’t want to. For some people, bringing it up will just make them feel worse.
Common chronic pain complaints include headache, low back pain, arthritis pain, pain from damage to the peripheral nerves or the central nervous system or pain without any known source.
A person can have more than one co-existing chronic pain condition, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, endometriosis, sciatica, peripheral neuropathy, or inflammatory bowel disease, or depression.
Accept that words may be inadequate to describe how the sufferer is feeling. Recall a time when you experienced a lot of pain and imagine that pain being present twenty-four hours a day every day without relief for the rest of your life. It's hard to find the words for that sort of pain.;
, A numeric pain scale is used to measure pain intensity so healthcare providers can check treatment efficacy. A scale from 1 to 10 describes the pain level. 1 is ""no pain at all, feel wonderful"" and 10 is the ""worst pain ever felt."" Ask where they are at on the pain scale.


Do not assume the chronic pain sufferer is not experiencing pain if they say they are fine. Many sufferers attempt to hide the pain due to a lack of understanding in others.
When asked about their pain level, chronic pain sufferers may not give you their actual level of pain. Because their pain is chronic, they are used to a certain level of pain and may just accept that as normal or no pain. They may only give you a correct pain level when they have some form of acute pain, when the ""normal"" level of pain that they live with daily changes, when they experience pain that now feels differently (I.e., ""shooting"" instead of ""aching"", "" burning"" instead of throbbing""), or when they are asked directly about their current levels of both acute and chronic pain.

, When you have the flu, you probably feel miserable for a few days or weeks but do the best you can to function. Chronic pain sufferers have probably been feeling awful for a long time. They may have adopted coping mechanisms that conceal the real level of pain they feel or they may not have the strength to function normally.

, Chronic pain may cause secondary depression (wouldn't you get depressed and down if you were hurting constantly for months or years?). Depression may be due directly to chronic pain, and chronic pain may be directly due to depression.Depression can cause some people to show less emotion, which can mask the pain because the sufferer ceases to make it known.Always be on the lookout for signs of depression, and do not confuse this with there being any less pain.
Depression may also cause people to show more emotion (crying and tearful, anxious, irritable, sad, lonely, hopelessness, fear of the future, easily agitated, angry, frustrated, hyper/over talkative due to medications/need to vent/lack of sleep). This, like their pain level, can vary day to day, hour to hour, minute to minute.
One of the worst things you can do is abandon someone with chronic pain. That just gives them one more reason to be depressed, feel lonely and not be very positive. Try to be there for them and show them support however you can.

, With many diseases, a person will exhibit obvious signs of conditions, such as paralysis fever or broken bones. With chronic pain, however, there is no way to tell what a person’s ability to cope with movement is like at any given moment. You can't always read it on their face or in their body language either.


The sufferer may not know, from day-to-day, how they are going to feel when they wake up. Each day has to be taken as it comes. This can be confusing for everyone but is very frustrating for the sufferer.
Being able to stand up for ten minutes doesn't mean that the sufferer can stand up for twenty minutes, or an hour. Just because the person managed to stand up for thirty minutes yesterday doesn't imply that they will be able to do the same today.
Movement is not the only limitation that chronic pain sufferers may experience. One’s ability to sit, walk, concentrate and be sociable can also be affected.
Be very understanding if the chronic pain sufferer says they have to sit down, lie down, stay in bed or take these pills right now. It probably means that they have no choice and can't put it off just because they happen to be somewhere or are in the middle of doing something. Chronic pain does not wait for anyone.

, Grimacing, restlessness, irritability, mood swings, wringing of hands, moaning, sleep disturbance, teeth grinding, poor concentration, decreased activity and perhaps even writing down suicidal thoughts or language can indicate distress or pain. Be sensitive to what they are going through., You might think that chronic pain sufferers go to doctors because they seek attention, enjoy it or are hypochondriacs. What they are actually doing is looking for something to improve the quality of their life, and often they are looking for the cause of their pain if it is not known. No one wants to feel the way they do but they don’t have a choice.

, Pain is a difficult thing to describe to another person. It is felt personally and is based in both psychological and physical parts of us. Even if you are very empathetic, never assume that you know exactly how it feels for that person. Sure, you know how it feels for you but each of us is different, and it's impossible to get inside a person's skin and feel their pain.

, Being empathetic means you attempt to understand another person’s feelings, perspectives and behavior by seeing the world through their eyes. You use this understanding to guide what you do for and say to that person. People with chronic pain are different than you in some ways but are also very much like you, so focus on what you have in common and try to understand the differences.Being sick does not mean that the sufferer is no longer a human being. Though chronic pain sufferers spend the majority of their day in considerable pain, they still want the same things that healthy people want. They too want to enjoy work, family, friends and leisure activities.
The chronic pain sufferer may feel as if they are stuck inside a body in which they have little or no control. Pain puts everything you used to enjoy out of reach and can contribute to feelings of helplessness, sadness and depression.
Try to remember how lucky you are to be physically able to do all of the things that you can do. Then imagine if you couldn’t.

, They may attempt to cope, sound happy and look normal as often as they can. They live their lives to the best of their ability. Keep in mind that when the chronic pain sufferer says they are in pain - they are!

, One of the best things that you can do for a chronic pain sufferer is to listen to them. To be a good listener, pay attention and try to understand what is going on inside of that person so that you can grasp how they are feeling and what they really need.


Make it clear that you want to hear what they have to say. Many people with chronic pain feel that others won’t believe them or will ridicule them for being weak.
Try to decode what they're hiding or minimizing through body language and tone of voice.
Allow yourself to be vulnerable. Sharing means you both give something. To create a strong empathetic bond and really make your exchange matter, you will need to reveal your true feelings, beliefs and experiences as well.
Read How to be a good listener for more details on being a great listener.

, If you find yourself being impatient and wanting the sufferer to ""just get on with it"", you risk laying a guilt trip on the person who is suffering from pain and undermining their determination to cope. They probably want to comply with your requests to do things but don’t have the strength or coping capacity as a result of the pain.


Don't be put off if the chronic pain sufferer seems touchy. They have been going through a lot. Chronic pain wreaks havoc on the body and the mind. These people do their best to cope with how exhausting and exasperating the pain is but can’t always be ok. Try to accept them as they are.
A chronic pain sufferer may need to cancel a previous commitment at the last minute. If this happens, please do not take it personally.

, The chronic pain sufferer depends a great deal on people who are not sick to support them at home or visit them when they're too sick to go out. Sometimes they need help with bathing, dressing, personal cares, etc. They may need help getting to the doctor. You can be their link to the ""normality"" of life and help them keep in touch with the parts of life that they miss and desperately want to undertake again.


Many people offer to help but really aren't there when asked to be. If you offer to help, make sure you follow through. The person with chronic pain that you care about is depending on you.

, If you are living with a chronic pain sufferer or supporting such a person on a regular basis, you need to maintain balance in your own life. If you don't take care of your own needs, health and work-life balance, being around the chronic pain sufferer can really bring you down. Avoid suffering from carer burn-out by getting other people to help and taking time out. Care for this person as much as you're able but remember to also care for yourself.

, Although the person with chronic pain has changed, they think the same. Remember who they are and the things they did before the pain became so bad. They are still the intelligent mind that made a good living at a job they may have loved and had no choice but to give up. Be kind, thoughtful and don’t patronize them.


Punishing an ill person for not following through with something will make them feel worse and show them that you really don't understand. Those experiencing chronic pain already deal with more than most could ever comprehend. Try to understand why they couldn’t follow through.

, Just because someone cannot do certain activities very often or has cancelled before does not mean that you shouldn't ask them to join you or should hide that you have plans from them. There may be some days when that activity is manageable, and chronic pain is isolating enough! Please understand and keep asking.

, Instead of suggesting how sufferers can fix their pain, consider being empathetic and giving them a gentle hug to let them know you're there to support them. They already hear and see endless doctors who tell them how to fix or help their chronic pain.


Sometimes just laying your hand on the shoulder of someone can help give them comfort. Remember to be gentle. Use a soft touch, something to help them connect.

, Realize that chronic pain is variable and a pep talk can be aggravating and demoralizing for the chronic pain sufferer. If you want them to do something, then ask if they can and respect their answer.


Try not to say: ""But you did it before!"" or ""Oh, come on, I know you can do this!""
Staying as active as possible and partaking in activities like walking, biking, and tai chi may help ease muscle and joint pain. Sometimes being sedentary causes pain to get worse. However, don’t lecture on the value of exercise and fresh air. For a chronic pain sufferer, these things may not help the pain and can often exacerbate it. Telling them that they need to exercise or do something to ""get their mind off of it"" may frustrate them. If they were capable of doing these things any or all of the time, they would.
Another statement that hurts is, ""You just need to push yourself more, try harder"". Sometimes participating in a single activity for a short or long period of time can cause more damage and physical pain for the chronic pain sufferer—not to mention the recovery time, which can be intense.
An individual with chronic pain does not need to be told ""You are too sensitive"", ""You have to deal with it better"" or ""You have to do it for X, Y or Z"". Of course they are sensitive! You have no idea what they cope with or the amount of pain or worry they deal with.

, Chronic pain sufferers are constantly working with doctors, striving to improve and do the right things for their illness. You may not give the correct advice, especially if you're not medically trained and haven't got a clue what that person is dealing with.


Be sensitive when suggesting medicines or alternative treatments. Prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicines and alternative therapies can have side effects and unintended consequences.
Some sufferers may not appreciate suggestions—but it's not because they don't want to get well. They may have heard of it or tried it already. They may not be ready to cope with a new treatment that can create an additional burden on their already over-burdened lives. Treatments that haven't worked carry the emotional pain of failure, which in and of itself can make the person feel worse.
If there is something that cured or helped people with a particular form of chronic pain like theirs, then let the sufferer know when they seem receptive and are ready to hear it. Be sensitive to how you bring it up.
Don't lecture about prescription medicine if they've been prescribed by a doctor. Pain control is hard to manage and some days these sufferers may require more pain medicine than others. Tolerance is NOT addiction.
Avoid being judgmental about drug use pursued by chronic pain sufferers.

, Don’t assume you know best by making statements such as ""Ah well, that's life, you'll just have to deal with it"", or ""You'll get over it eventually”, “Until then, you'll just have to do your best"", or worst of all, ""Well, you look well enough"", etc. These lines are a form of distancing yourself from the ill person. Often, it just makes the sufferer feel worse and out of hope.People who live with chronic pain know how they feel and are well aware of their situation, so avoid projecting onto the sufferer how you think they should be feeling.
Throw lifelines rather than throwaway lines by saying something like: ""So how can I help you"", or ""is there anything that I can do to help you deal with your pain?"", Don't say “I've had that before and I'm fine now”. It shows your lack of understanding and makes the person living with chronic pain feel like a failure that they can't handle what they are experiencing and others would do a much better job in the same situation.

, It's awful living with chronic pain, but it's even worse when people give up on them, misunderstand them or spread negativity. Everyday life can be hard and very lonely for chronic pain sufferers. Constant support, offering hope and showing your love are all crucial things to communicate to them.


Comfort those with chronic pain, and let them know that you are there for them. A loyal friend is a life saver!

, Inquire how satisfied the sufferer is with their treatment. It’s important to ask helpful questions about whether the chronic sufferer thinks their treatment is satisfactory or if they think their pain is bearable.People rarely ask these open-ended ""helpful questions"" that might help the chronic sufferer open up and really talk.

, Don't stop asking someone with chronic pain ""How are you?"" just because the answer might be uncomfortable for you. It may be the only opportunity to show you care about their well-being. And if you don't like the answer, remember that it is their answer—not your opinion.


When the ill person finally opens up to someone, they should not be told that they ""talk about it too much"" or it's ""all they talk about"". Recognize that pain is probably a huge part of their lives. They may not want to talk about things like vacations, shopping, sports or gossip.

, Sometimes sharing silence together is good, and the sufferer is just happy to have you there with them. You don't have to fill every minute of conversation with words. Your presence says a whole lot!

, Don't use platitudes or bold allegations not based on fact to hide your ignorance. There is much even the medical community does not know about chronic pain. There is no harm in saying ""I don't know"" and then offering to find things out.

Stop doing the activity.,
Rest the affected muscles.,
Stretch.,
Perform gentle exercises for back spasms.,
Use a heating pad or cold press.,
Drink fluids and electrolytes.",How to Treat Muscle Spasms1," When a muscle spasm begins, stop your activity. Spasms can happen during exercise or while doing normal daily tasks. At the first sign of a spasm, stop what you are doing and try to deal with the spasm.Although they can be painful, there are generally no long-term concerns.Try massaging or rubbing the area with the spasm. This can help relax the muscle and increase blood flow to the area.;
, Rest them for a few days after the spasm, especially if it was a back spasm. Soreness is common after spasms. Your muscles may be strained and should get some time to recover without additional stress. Make sure to gently move the muscle during this time to prevent any stiffness.


You may use the affected muscle lightly, but stop using it if you feel a cramp or pain coming on. Try gentle walking or stretches, but don't twist or bend the torso.

, If you experience a muscle spasm or cramp, stretching can help. When you stretch, you pull the muscle in the opposite direction of the contracted muscle, elongating it. When you stretch, you want to gently lengthen and pull the affected muscle. Don't overextend the muscle. If you start to feel pain, stop. If it feels tight, hold it but don't go any further. Hold each stretch for approximately 30 seconds.For calf cramps (Charley horse), stand a few feet from a wall. Place forearms against the wall while keeping the knees and back straight. Heels should be touching the floor.Lean forward. You should feel the calf muscles stretching. The feeling should be pleasant or neutral. If you feel any pain, stop.For foot or calf cramps (Charley horse), sit down and flex the toes on the cramping leg upward toward the nose. You can also gently pull the foot towards your head. You should feel pulling in your calf or foot muscles.
For a hamstring cramp, sit on the floor and extend your legs in front of you. Your feet should be neither pointed or flexed. Bend at the waist while keeping your back straight. Lower your chest towards your legs. Stop bending once you feel the stretch in the back of your legs.For a cramp in the thigh, hold on to a stable surface, grab your ankle, and gently pull your foot back towards your rear.The pull will be along the front of your thigh.
For a spasm in the hand, rest the palm flat against the wall and push the hand against the wall with the fingers facing down., If you are experiencing back spasms, gentle exercises may help. Only do exercises with a spasming back when the pain has lessened or the cramping is minimal. Don't do them if the back spasm is severe or very painful. If any of these exercises makes the spasm worse, stop.


Walk around as you lift your knees higher than normal and keep your back straight. This provides a gentle stretching movement to your lower back that may help uncramp the muscle.Raise your arms over your head. Repeat 10 times, and hold for 5-10 seconds. Do this 3-4 times per day. This helps stretch the muscles in your back.Lie on the floor and pull a knee gently to your chest. Hold for 10 seconds and switch sides. Repeat 5-10 times, 2-3 times a day.You can also pull both of your knees to your chest. These movements stretch out your lower back while letting the rest of your muscles relax and ""unkink."", Heat causes muscles to relax and stop spasming. Cold can help swelling and pain. The first time a spasm occurs, use a cold press. Put an ice pack on the affected area the first couple of days. Keep the ice on the spasm for 20-30 minutes every 3-4 hours. Then, if the spasm persists, use moist heat for 20-30 minutes throughout the day.Remember the phrase: ""heat to play, ice to stay."" Use heat when activity will occur afterwards. Use ice when you will be sedentary and resting after.
Apply heat for 15 minutes every 4 hours until the cramp is gone. Apply a cold press for 12-15 minutes every 2 hours for the first couple of days.
Use a heating pad or a heat patch, or an ice pack or an ice patch. You can also try a bottle full of hot water or frozen water. Or try wrapping ice in a cloth or a pack of frozen peas., When your muscles are dehydrated, it is important to get enough hydration. Water and electrolytes (in the form or juice, sports drinks, etc..) can help you replenish a decreased supply. Sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium are needed for your muscles to adequately contract and relax.


If you know you'll be exercising a lot or using your muscles vigorously, make sure to replace these nutrients with an electrolyte drink and water.Muscle spasms can sometimes indicate a deficiency in vitamins or minerals in the body. Make sure to take high-quality multivitamins and multi minerals.

Focus on the positives of the moment.,
Let go of stress and banish negative thoughts.,
Think about the end point.,
Practice.",How to Be Present when Pain Kicks in During Sport Events," When your body starts to ache so much it becomes unbearable and your mind is telling you to stop, then it is time to step into the present. Consider the things that you can view as a positive about you:


The scenery around you might be spectacular

The air might be incredibly fresh and bracing






The crowd's presence and cheering might be thrilling






You are free - free to exercise, to push yourself, to be the best






Your body is healthy and is responding to what you are demanding of it; how splendid, amazing, and beautiful is that? Hugely wonderful!





;
, Close your eyes temporarily, breathe deeply, and push on through to the next stage of your race or competition. Take a moment to savor what is around you, what is happening, what is real, rather than repeating over and over to yourself how much things hurt and how this experience is not working for you.

, It's the near present and it is something to savor before you get there. Practice visualization of how what you are experiencing right now is leading to the reward of the finish, an experience so many other people are never going to know and fully understand. Be grateful for the chance to know what it is like to push your body so hard that it hurts and to get a reward of the finality of a race or competition. It is not an experience every human being will have; it is an experience that teaches you endurance, patience, and self-control, all positive emotions.

, Getting into the present can be difficult but it is what separates top athletes from those of us who flounder and give up at the pain point. If at first you don't succeed, try to try again. Learning to love the pain that you are experiencing because the things going on around you are so fulfilling, amazing, supportive, and rewarding is an art that comes with practice.

Work with a physical therapist to develop an exercise plan.,
Listen to your body.,
Seek treatment for symptoms that call for medical attention.",How to Avoid Worsening Persistent Back Pain2," While exercise and regular stretching can be great for chronic back pain, it’s best to take on a regimen under the guidance of a trainer or physical therapist. He or she can make sure than your form is correct and give you repetitive motions that will target your specific needs. They can also help you determine whether stretching exercises, which reduce pain, or strengthening, which improves function and mobility, are better for your particular condition.If strengthen is a problem, then you can try pool therapy to start off nice and easy. This is a relaxing way to get exercise without putting too much stress on your joints. Talk to your doctor about getting a physical therapy prescription for water therapy.

, If a particular motion causes pain, then stop doing it. Trying to force a painful motion can damage a mechanical back problem, whether you’re suffering acute or chronic pain. This applies to everyday activities, doing manual labor, and exercising., Back pain usually gets better within a few weeks, but it is best not to ignore it. See your doctor or get a referral to a spine specialist if you have any of these symptoms:Numbness and tingling.
Severe or sudden acute pain.
Pain that results from trauma or injury.
Pain accompanied by weakness, fever, or trouble urinating.
Severe pain that lasts for more than a couple weeks."
"
See a spine specialist in addition to your general practitioner.,
See a chiropractor.,
Focus on more than just MRI results.,
Report your symptoms clearly and understand your medical options.,
Consider surgery as a last resort.",How to Avoid Worsening Persistent Back Pain3," You should ask your doctor before starting an exercise regimen if you have severe symptoms, or before taking any medications for persistent back pain. However, spine medicine is a distinct field, and primary care physicians don’t often have much in-depth, relevant training. They can, however, refer you to a specialist who can offer a more accurate diagnosis and treatment plan., A chiropractic adjustment can realign your spine and relieve the muscle and connective tissue damage that misaligned vertebrae can cause. A chiropractor can also give you more information about your specific issues, and can ""read"" your spine to suggest ways to make your daily routines easier on your back. Chiropractic care can also be helpful for head and neck pain, and is the most common non-surgical alternative for both chronic and acute back pain in the United States., A full clinical diagnosis is preferable to relying on imaging techniques, like MRI or CT. A scan can show a healthy spine despite severe pain reported by a patient, or it can reveal a herniated disc despite the patient having no pain. Specialists have also reported that pressure from patients is a common reason they perform imaging tests in the first place: if a medical professional doesn’t suggest an MRI or other scan, don’t try to convince them otherwise., Since there is such a range of factors that contribute to chronic back pain, be sure to clearly indicate your symptoms, whether you’re on any medications, and other key details. Medical history is often the most important tool in diagnosing back pain.Make sure you understand your diagnosis and treatment plan, since back pain is deeply connected to your daily lifestyle.

, Don’t jump to surgery too quickly. Many people view spine surgery as a “quick fix,” but it’s typically recommended to stick to the non-surgical treatment for at least 4 to 6 weeks before considering surgery.Also, remember that exercise and physical therapy are essential components of surgical recovery anyway.

Treat spasms with over the counter pain relievers.,
Take anti-inflammatory medications.,
Take muscle relaxers.,
Talk to your doctor if spasms are chronic.",How to Treat Muscle Spasms2," Sometimes muscle spasms can cause extreme pain. Ask your doctor about taking over the counter pain medicine, such as nonsteroidal anti-infammatory drugs (NSAIDS). These include ibuprofen (Advil) or naproxen sodium (Aleve).You may also try acetaminophen (Tylenol)., These reduce any excessive inflammation or swelling of the affected area. Anti-inflammatories can also help increase blood flow to allow the area to heal. Your doctor will likely recommend that you take an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication (such as Ibuprofen) as the first line of treatment.Ibuprofen side effects most commonly include gastrointestinal issues, but they're lower than the effects from aspirin. Ibuprofen side effects include: nausea, heartburn, diarrhea, indigestion, constipation, abdominal cramps, dizziness, headache, nervousness, or rash., If you have an injury or a muscle that is causing constant or repeating spasms, you should see your physician. Your doctor can prescribe medicine that will help relax your muscles and increase blood flow.Talk to your doctor if any medicine you take causes muscle spasms.Flexeril (cyclobenzaprine) is a commonly prescribed medication for moderate to severe muscle spasms that works on your central nervous system to relax your muscles. While this is helpful, NSAIDs (like ibuprofen) have been shown to relieve acute symptoms from muscle spasms more effectively.Some muscle relaxers are highly addictive. Keep this in mind and monitor intake.

, You should be able to treat muscle spasms at home. But, if spasms are too painful, occur frequently, last a long time, or affect additional muscles, you should see your doctor. The spasm might be a sign of an underlying problem that needs treatment.Muscle spasms themselves are not usually a diagnosis. Instead, spasms can mean that there is another issue that needs to be diagnosed and treated. The issue can range from simple overuse of the muscle to an underlying metabolic disorder for chronic spasms.

Recognize the symptoms of smooth muscles spasms.,
Seek medical attention for spasms of the digestive tract, urinary tract, or respiratory tract.,
Take medication.,
Try antispasmodics if you have Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS).,
Schedule bathroom trips for bladder spasms.,
Try a heat pack for abdominal spasms.",How to Treat Muscle Spasms3," Symptoms of these spasms be different depending on the muscles involved. Spasms of the intestines can cause sharp pain and diarrhea. Urinary tract spasms often happen when kidney stones are present, causing severe pain, nausea, and vomiting. If you notice respiratory tract spasms or trouble breathing, seek emergency medical attention. They can be fatal if not quickly treated.


Rule out or treat intestinal problems, such as gallbladder stones or tumors. Urinary spasms will often lessen once you pass or remove kidney stones. You might be able to use medication to treat the pain while waiting for them to pass., Unfortunately, you can't control these smooth muscles, found in organs like your heart and stomach. Spasms in these muscles can sometimes mean there's an underlying medical condition., If you have severe smooth muscle spasms, your doctor may be able to prescribe you medicine. For example, medications such as anticholinergic agents can help intestinal spasms that do not respond to diet and lifestyle changes.


Your doctor may prescribe medications to restore neurotransmitter levels or Botox to paralyze the affected muscles. You should discuss these options with your doctor.

, If you have IBS, you may experience a spasm of the intestine. Antispasmodics help the intestines relax, which helps relieve pain. Talk to your doctor if you have spasms of the intestine, and your doctor can prescribe the proper antispasmodic and treatment plan., One way to treat bladder spasms is to go to the bathroom every 1.5 to 2 hours. This helps keep your bladder empty, so hopefully fewer accidents occur. As the spasms decrease, you can take longer between bathroom breaks.


Kegel exercises, also called pelvic floor exercises, can also help bladder spasms by strengthening and relaxing the bladder. To tighten your pelvic muscles, squeeze your bladder muscles like you were trying to stop urine from flowing or trying to stop yourself from passing gas. Your physician can give you specific instructions if you are struggling to get them right., Heat packs may help relax cramps and spasms in all muscles of the body. Lie on your back and wrap the heat pack around your abdomen and be sure to avoid direct contact of the heat pad with your body.Keep the heat pack on for 10 to 15 minutes and no more than 20 minutes at a time. Relax while you wait.To make your own heat pack, find a large piece of flannel or cloth. It should cover your abdomen when you fold it. Cover the cloth with a heating pad or heated water bottle. Wrap a bath towel or other fabric around you to keep everything snug and in place.

Drink plenty of fluids.,
Practice good nutrition.,
Exercise.,
Stretch regularly.",How to Treat Muscle Spasms4," Staying hydrated is an important part of preventing muscle spasms. Muscles are more likely to cramp up if they are dehydrated. This is vital if you are working out. Drink at least 6 to 8 glasses of water or healthy drinks throughout your day.Replace electrolytes, especially sodium and potassium, when you're exercising or sick. You can do this through diet or electrolyte-enhanced beverages., Keep healthy by eating the right foods and nutrients. This can prevent muscle spasms. Adjusting your diet can help relieve intestinal spasms caused by irritable bowel syndrome. Potassium, antioxidants and healthy fats are especially good for muscle spasms. These foods are known to help with spasms:


Bananas, potatoes, prune juice, dried fruits,oranges, brown rice, avocados, spinach,seafood, almonds, flaxseed, oats, sesame seeds, tofu, and kale., Regular exercise can help reduce muscle cramps since it stretches and strengthens the muscle.This can help injured muscles. Gentle physical therapy can gradually help the muscle heal, which may reduce spasms. Regular exercise also improves your overall health.


Talk to your doctor or physical therapist about what exercises will help your muscles., Since spasms occur when a muscle contracts, stretching helps prevent these contractions. Stretching exercises keep your muscles loose and flexible.Make sure to stretch your muscles before and after any exercise, especially if the exercise is rigorous or for an extended period of time.If you have muscles that often cramp at night, stretch those muscles before bed to loosen them up.You may also try light cardio, like riding a stationary bike, before sleeping to loosen the muscles and prevent cramps."

Take walks.,
Do ankle pumps.,
Try ankle rotations.,
Do buttock squeezes.,
Try knee bends.,
Do straight leg raises.",How to Continue Therapy at Home After a Hip Replacement1," When you are recovering from your hip surgery, you need to start a walking program within a few days of returning home. It may be somewhat painful at first, but it is critically important that you do this. Make sure you start slowly by walking with your walker or crutches from one side of a room to another. Slowly increase either the length of the walk or how frequently you do the walk.


Once you get more comfortable with walking, start going outside for short walks and start using stairs.
Always ask your doctor before increasing any exercise length or frequency, including walking or other exercises. You may have specific limitations depending on how well you are healing, how extensive your hip replacement was, and your personal health.;
, For the first few days after your surgery, you will need to keep your blood flowing in your legs and feet to prevent any blood clots. You can do some ankle pumps to help. Sit or lie down on your back. Slowly raise your foot up towards your head and point your toes up. Lower your foot.


Repeat these exercises at least 10 to 15 times every hour.Although these exercises are important for the leg that underwent surgery, it is a good practice to do them on both to keep your blood flowing in your non-injured leg as well.

, Another exercise to help blood flow is ankle rotation. You can either sit or lie down on your back. Rotate your foot in a circular fashion four or five times, then repeat the circles in the other direction.


Repeat at least 10 to 15 times every hour.
You can combine ankle rotations with ankle pumps in a routine., You also need to make sure your muscles and blood keep flowing in your hip and buttock area. To help this, tighten your buttock muscles and hold for five counts. Then, release your buttock muscles. Repeat this exercise 10 times.


Do these exercises at least three to four times throughout the day., Another exercise you can do to help leg circulation is a knee bend. Sit with your legs out in front of you on your bed or couch. Keeping one leg flat, slide your other foot along the bed as you bend your knee toward the ceiling as far as is comfortable. Then, lower your leg. Repeat on the other side.


Repeat 10 repetitions on each side at least three to four times a day., You can also do straight leg raises to help leg and hip circulation. Sit with your legs out in front of you on the bed or couch. Keeping your leg as straight as you can, lift your leg up off the bed. Hold for five counts, then slowly lower it. Repeat this on your other leg.


Repeat 10 repetitions on each leg and do the whole cycle three to four times a day."

Rest your shoulder.,
Ice your shoulder.,
Take over-the-counter drugs.,
Do some light shoulder stretches.,
Build shoulder strength.,
Distinguish between acute and chronic conditions.,
Get a shoulder massage.,
Consider acupuncture.,
See a chiropractor.,
See your doctor.,
See a physical therapist.,
Get a cortisone injection.,
Consider surgery as a last resort.",How to Stop Shoulder Pains," Often, but not always, the root cause of shoulder pain is simple overexertion — lifting things that are too heavy or lifting lighter loads too often. Stop the aggravating activity for at least a few days. If your problem is work related, then if possible, talk to your boss about switching to a different activity. If the shoulder pain is exercise related, then you may be working out too aggressively or with bad form — consult with a personal trainer.


Excessive bed rest is not a good idea for any type of musculoskeletal injury because some movement is needed to stimulate blood flow and healing. As such, some rest is good, but complete inactivity is counterproductive.
Reconsider your sleeping environment. Mattresses that are too soft or pillows that are too thick may contribute to shoulder pain. Sleeping on your back for a few days or weeks may be needed so as to not aggravate your shoulder.
Shoulder joint pain (as opposed to muscle pain) frequently worsens at night while in bed.;
, The application of ice is an effective treatment for essentially all acute injuries — including shoulder strains and sprains — because it constricts blood vessels (reducing blood flow) and numbs nerve fibers.Cold therapy should be applied to the most tender part of your shoulder in order to reduce the swelling and pain. Apply ice for 10-15 minutes every hour, then reduce the frequency as the pain and swelling subside in your shoulder.


Compressing the ice against your shoulder with a bandage or elastic support will also help control the inflammation.
Always wrap ice or frozen gel packs in a thin towel in order to prevent frostbite on your skin.

, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin can be short-term solutions to help you deal with pain or inflammation in your shoulder — they can be found in every pharmacy and grocery store. Keep in mind that these medications can be hard on your stomach, kidneys and liver, so it's best not to use them for more than 2 weeks at a stretch and to take them with food.Talk to your doctor about your medical problems you have and any medications that you take before taking these medications.
Follow the instructions on the package or your doctor's instructions on dosing.
Alternatively, you can try over-the-counter analgesics such as acetaminophen (Tylenol and Paracetamol) or muscle relaxants (such as cyclobenzaprine) for your shoulder pain, but never take them concurrently with NSAIDs.

, If your shoulder pain is primarily achy in nature and doesn't involve sharp, stabbing or shooting pain with movement or a dislocation, then likely you're experiencing a muscle strain. Mild muscle strains respond well to some light stretching because it relieves muscle tension, promotes blood flow and improves flexibility.In general, hold stretches (without bouncing) for about 30 seconds and do them 3x daily until the discomfort fades away.


Trying to protect your sore shoulder by not moving it or putting it in a sling may increase the risk of adhesive capsulitis or ""frozen shoulder,"" which is characterized by scar tissue, chronic stiffness and reduced range of motion.
While standing or sitting, reach around the front of your body and grab the opposite elbow. Gently pull on the back of the elbow until you feel a stretch in the corresponding shoulder.
While standing or sitting, reach behind your back towards your shoulder blade and interlock with your other hand (diagram above). Slowly pull on the hand with the sore shoulder until you feel a good stretch.

, If your shoulder pain is caused by overexertion (especially while on the job), you may benefit from strength-building exercises, assuming you perform them safely and correctly.When your initial pain subsides, try to introduce low-intensity, low-impact shoulder strengthening exercises to your routine. Stronger muscles such as the deltoids and rotator cuff are more able to handle the strain and exertion that can lead to shoulder pain, decreasing the likelihood that it will return.


Work with a personal trainer or physical therapist to make sure you are doing the exercises correctly.
Make sure your shoulder muscles are warmed up before exercising them. Taking a warm shower or applying moist heat or doing simple calisthenics before weight training is recommended because your shoulder muscles will be more pliable.

, Although rest, ice and over-the-counter drugs are certainly helpful for acute (sudden) shoulder injuries, chronic (long-term) shoulder pain caused by arthritis or other degenerative conditions requires a little different approach.For example, for non-inflammatory osteoarthritis of the shoulder (the wear and tear type), applying some moist heat first thing in the morning may provide pain relief, reduce stiffness and increase your mobility.


As a source of moist heat, microwaved herbal bags work well and are often infused with aromatherapy (such as lavender) that has relaxing properties.
Supplements such as glucosamine, chondroitin, MSM and various fish oils may help lubricate and cushion arthritic joints.

, A strained muscle occurs when individual muscle fibers are taken beyond their limits and tear, which leads to pain, inflammation and some degree of guarding (muscle spasm in attempts to prevent further damage). A deep tissue massage is helpful for mild-to-moderate strains because it reduces muscle spasm, combats inflammation and promotes relaxation.Start with a 30 minute massage, focusing on your shoulder, lower neck and mid back areas. Allow the therapist to go as deep as you can tolerate without wincing.


Always drink lots of water immediately following a massage in order to flush out inflammatory by-products and lactic acid from your body. Failure to do so might cause a headache or mild nausea.
Your therapist may do trigger point therapy that focuses on areas of tight muscle fibers that can form in your shoulder after injuries or overuse.

, Acupuncture is an ancient art and involves sticking very thin needles into specific energy points within the skin / muscle in efforts to reduce pain and inflammation.Acupuncture for shoulder pain (caused by an injury or arthritis) can be effective, especially if it's done when the symptoms first occur. Based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture works by releasing a variety of substances including endorphins and serotonin, which act to reduce pain.


Acupuncture is practiced by a variety of health professionals including some physicians, chiropractors, naturopaths, physical therapists and massage therapists — whoever you choose should be certified by NCCAOM.
Acupuncture points that may provide relief to your shoulder pain are not all located near where you feel the pain — some can be in distant areas of the body.

, Chiropractors are joint specialists who focus on establishing normal motion and function of the spine and peripheral joints such as the shoulder. Shoulder pain is not only caused by the underlying glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joints, but also from joint issues in the neck and mid back. Your chiropractor is trained to diagnose joint problems and treat them (if appropriate) with manual joint manipulation, also called adjustments — they often illicit a ""popping"" or ""cracking"" sound.


Although one joint adjustment can sometimes completely relieve your shoulder pain, more than likely it will take 3-5 treatments to notice significant results.
Manual joint manipulation is not a good idea for inflammatory arthritis.
Other professions that use manual joint manipulation include osteopaths and some physicians and physiotherapists.

, If your shoulder pain is especially severe, long-lasting (more than a few weeks) or debilitating, and home remedies are not particularly helpful, then make an appointment with your doctor. Your shoulder pain may be caused by something serious such as a torn tendon, damaged cartilage, dislocated joint, fracture or inflammatory arthritis.Your doctor may refer you to a specialist such as an orthopedist, neurologist or rheumatologist in order to better diagnose and treat your shoulder issue.


X-rays, bone scans, MRI, CT scan and nerve conduction studies are tools that specialists may use to help diagnose your shoulder pain.
Depending on your diagnosis, you may be given stronger prescription medications (especially if your pain is caused by arthritis) and/or asked to wear a shoulder sling short-term, which is common with severe joint sprains and dislocations. Your doctor will discuss a treatment plan tailored to your diagnosis with you.

, If your shoulder problem is recurring (chronic) and not alleviated by your own exercise routine, then you need to consider some form of rehabilitation guided by a professional. Your doctor can refer you to a physical therapist, who can show you specific and tailored stretches and strengthening exercises to rehabilitate your shoulder.Physiotherapy is usually required 2-3x per week for 4-8 weeks to positively impact chronic shoulder problems.


If need be, a physical therapist can treat your sore shoulder muscles with modalities such as therapeutic ultrasound or electronic muscle stimulation.
Good strengthening exercises for your shoulder include pushups, pullups, swimming and rowing, but make sure your injury is resolved first.

, Cortisone is a hormone that is sometimes administered medically to treat injuries and various forms of arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. An injection of steroid medication near or into a muscle, tendon or ligament can quickly reduce inflammation and allow normal, unrestricted movement of your shoulder again.Cortisone, compared to NSAIDs, has a longer duration of action and a stronger effect. The most common preparations used are prednisolone, dexamethasone and triamcinolone.


Potential complications of corticosteroid injections include infection, bleeding, tendon weakening, local muscle atrophy, nerve irritation / damage and decreased immune function.
If corticosteroid injections fail to provide adequate resolution for your shoulder problem, then surgery should be considered and discussed with your doctor.

, Surgery for chronic shoulder pain is often the last resort (after more conservative approaches have been tried), although it may be warranted immediately if your shoulder is dislocated or fractured due to serious trauma suffered from a car accident or sports injury, for examples.Osteoarthritis of the shoulder may lead to the formation of bone spurs or disintegrating cartilage, which can be remedied with arthroscopic surgery.
Rotator cuff tears — a group of four muscles surrounding the ball and socket shoulder joint — is a common cause of pain and disability that often needs surgery to remedy.Shoulder surgery may involve the use of metal rods, pins or other devices for structural support.
Possible complications from shoulder surgery include local infection, allergic reaction to anesthesia, nerve damage and chronic swelling/pain.
Be prepared for needing some time after the surgery to recover. You will most likely need to do stretching, exercises, or physical therapy during the recovery period.

But there are different types of pain with different causes such as from heat, pressure, or inflammation. Figuring out the source and cause of your pain can help you choose the best OTC pain relievers for your needs.Some common types of pain include:


Tension headaches, which feel like a tight band around your head and react well to all OTC pain relievers
Migraines, which cause throbbing pain, and respond best to aspirin and acetaminophen in combination with a small amount of caffeineArthritis pain, which is often caused by inflammation, responds well to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugsMuscle pain, which responds well to most OTC pain relievers;
, It’s important to figure out the source of your pain and what type it is. But you should also consider any other physical symptoms that you may have. This can also help you make a more informed decision about which OTC pain reliever to choose. It may also minimize any side effects you may experience from the medication such as an upset stomach.Recognize that some OTC pain medications, such as ibuprofen, are good for helping to relieve the discomfort from swelling, muscle and joint injuries or conditions, and even fever. But they may not be ideal if someone has other symptoms such as nausea. For example, if you have a migraine and are vomiting, consider taking acetaminophen with a small dose of caffeine. This can provide similar pain relief as an NSAID without the potential of upsetting your stomach even more.Recognize that you should choose specific OTC pain relievers if you have certain health conditions. For example, people who take blood pressure drugs or have kidney problems should avoid ibuprofen, aspirin, and naproxen sodium. These can interact with other medications or make your condition worse., Over-the-counter pain relievers are generally safe to use. However, some people may have allergies or sensitivities to OTC medications. These individuals should avoid OTC pain relievers. Considering possible allergies and cross sensitivities can make it easier to narrow down your choices of the best OTC pain reliever for you.Recognize that you may have allergies or sensitivities to certain drugs that may make you more sensitive to OTC pain killers. For example, people who are allergic to aspirin may have a cross sensitivity with other NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) including ibuprofen and naproxen sodium.People with allergies to other pain relievers such as opioids should also avoid NSAIDs.Ask your doctor or a pharmacist if there are any OTC pain relievers you may want to avoid because of potential cross sensitivities.

, People with certain health conditions such as kidney disease or pregnancy may not be able to take some OTC pain medications. Ask your doctor what medication may be best to manage your pain if you have any of the following or other health concerns:Kidney disease
Heart disease
Pregnancy
Nerve conditions
Asthma
Liver diseaseAlcoholism
Ulcers
Stomach or intestinal bleeding
Bleeding disorders

, In addition to allergies and conditions that may affect your OTC choice, you should also consider any other medication you take. Some drugs, such as blood pressure medicine, can interact with pain relievers. This may make them more or less effective and/or come with other side effects.Tell your doctor that you want to take a pain reliever. Ask if there are any you should avoid with your other medications.
If you have been taking OTC medication, make sure you tell your doctor at every appointment. Knowing everything you are taking or have tried is very important to your care and developing a treatment plan.
Recognize that some of the following drugs may have interactions with OTC pain relievers: blood thinners, ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and lithium., Pain relievers are grouped into classes of drugs. One such group is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. Ibuprofen is one of the NSAID drugs that you may choose to relieve your pain. Ibuprofen is a great choice for headaches as well as joint and muscle pain. In addition, it can also lower a fever.Use ibuprofen if you have any swelling or inflammation with your pain. It may help minimize both while relieving your discomfort.
Take 200 mg or 400 mg up to four times a day after a meal if you are an adult. Always follow dosing directions for yourself or others, such as children, to minimize your risk of an overdose.Recognize that ibuprofen can have side effects such as abdominal pain, bloating, belching, heartburn, flatulence, nausea or vomiting.Avoid ibuprofen if you have kidney problems.

, Aspirin is a good general analgesic that also falls into the category of an NSAID. It can relieve headaches, muscle aches, joint pain, and fevers.Take 300 – 600 mg of aspirin up to four times a day after food if you are an adult. Follow dosing or your doctor’s instructions for yourself and others, such as children, to minimize the risk of overdosing.Recognize that aspirin can come with side effects including diarrhea, constipation, headache, nausea, vomiting, stomach gas, and heartburn.Avoid giving aspirin to children under the age of 19, as it could cause a serious condition called Reye's Syndrome. You should also avoid aspirin if you have asthma, as it can make it worse and may also cause an allergic reaction that results in hives., Naproxen sodium is another NSAID that is great and relieving pain and inflammation. It’s especially effective for treating pain associated with inflammation such as arthritis, sprains, sunburns, and menstrual cramps. You may also want to choose naproxen sodium because its effects are longer lasting than other NSAIDs. This means you have to take it less often.Take one 250-, 375-, or 500 mg tablet of naproxen sodium twice each day in evenly spaced doses if you are an adult. Ask your doctor which dosage is best for you if you are unsure or giving it to someone other than yourself.Be aware that you may have the following side effects with naproxen sodium: stomach pain, constipation, diarrhea, gas, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and dizziness., Another type of analgesic that doesn’t fall into the category of an NSAID is acetaminophen. It is also a great OTC choice for relieving pain, but doesn’t come with anti-inflammatory ingredients. This makes acetaminophen less effective on muscles or sprains; however, it can be quite effective for osteoarthritis, especially in the elderly, and can also treat nerve pain or stomach issues.Take acetaminophen at regular intervals with water. Follow dosing on the bottle or your doctor’s instructions.Speak to your child’s pediatrician before giving them acetaminophen because you may need to take certain precautions or avoid the drug altogether.Recognize that you may have side effects such as headache, nausea, or upset stomach from taking acetaminophen.

, It is possible to unintentionally overdose on OTC medication if you are unaware that two brands have overlapping ingredients, or that they are in the same drug class. For instance, if you take Motrin and Advil — these are both ibuprofen, just with different brand names. Or you might take an Alka-Seltzer for indigestion and aspirin for a headache without realizing that Alka-Seltzer contains aspirin. Or you might want to take both aspirin and ibuprofen, but these are both NSAIDs, and should not be taken together, as this can lead to an overdose. You can take the NSAIDs class and alternate with acetaminophen (Tylenol) every four to six hours for a limited time.


Always check the active ingredients on your OTC medications to ensure you are not overdosing.
Avoid aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen at the same time. The only exception is if you are taking a daily baby aspirin for heart protection.

, If you are unsure of which OTC pain reliever you chose or may want to choose, ask a pharmacist or your doctor. Either can advise you why one specific medication may be preferable over another for you.Make sure to let the pharmacist know about any underlying medical conditions you have or medication you take.

Wear your postoperative shoe or walking cast.,
Stay off your feet for the first week.,
Use supportive walking shoes once your surgeon removes the cast or boot.,
Have your surgeon remove your sutures.,
Do not try to resume your normal walking routine for at least three weeks.,
Go to all of your doctor and physical therapy appointments.,
Consult your physical therapist before resuming any strenuous exercise routines.",How to Recover From Plantar Fasciitis Surgery1," Since an endoscopic procedure is less invasive than an open surgery, the recovery time is shorter as well. Your surgeon will bandage your foot after the surgery, and she will then wrap it in a walking cast or postoperative boot. You can expect to wear this for three to seven days after the surgery.Your doctor may end up recommending you wear the boot or cast for longer. Always wear it according to your surgeon’s postoperative directions.;
, While you are not forbidden from walking, your surgeon will recommend that you stay off the foot as much as possible for the first week after the surgery.This will limit your pain, recovery period, and potential for complications such as soft tissue damage around the site.Your surgeon will likely tell you to stay off your feet for everything but getting up to use the restroom and eat.You should also keep the foot and bandage completely dry to reduce the risk of infection., At your first follow-up appointment, your surgeon will decide whether or not to remove your cast/boot yet. If your surgeon removes it, then he will recommend that you wear shoes with plenty of arch support for the next several weeks while still minimizing the amount of weight you place on your foot.Podiatrists and surgeons will typically prescribe custom orthotic shoe inserts before ever performing plantar fasciitis surgery. Return to using your orthotics as directed to provide the additional support as your foot heals., Your surgeon will remove any sutures from the procedure at your next appointment, which will likely be anywhere from 10 to 14 days after your initial procedure.Once the sutures are out, you are free to resume bathing your foot. You can also resume placing your full weight on the foot., Even with your sutures out and using your orthotics, you are likely to experience some discomfort from walking for around three weeks.If your job requires you to spend long hours on your feet, then you may have to take this time off work.You should arrange this with your employer before scheduling your plantar fasciitis surgery.
When you do have to be on your feet, you may find relief from discomfort in icing and elevating your foot afterward. By placing a frozen water bottle on the floor and using your foot to roll across it, you can perform a good stretch on the area as well as icing it., You will have additional follow-up appointments with your doctor at her discretion. You can also expect to meet with a physical therapist who will teach you how to stretch the muscles and tendons in your foot safely for the best outcome after your surgery. Always schedule these appointments based on the suggestions of these professional providers and attend each appointment.


Stretches include massaging your plantar fascia by using a small, hard object such as a golf ball to roll under your foot.Another easy way to exercise the corresponding muscles and tendons is to flex your toes down and in to grasp a towel or even the carpet beneath your feet., Even after you’re walking normally without any discomfort, your doctor or physical therapist may recommend easing yourself back into high-impact exercise routines. Consult them about the best exercises and schedule for resuming your workout regimen.


Don’t be surprised if they suggest switching to lower impact exercises, such as swimming and cycling, for several months after your procedure.

Check if you have had your mattress for more than eight years.,
Create a more supportive bed.,
Buy supportive pillows.",How to Sleep With Lower Back Pain1," If so, it may be time for an upgrade. The materials in a mattress break down over time and become less supportive to your back and body.There is no one type of mattress that is “the best” for people who suffer back pain, so test a few out before you purchase one to discover what’s most comfortable for you. Some people may prefer firm mattresses, while others may prefer soft.
A foam mattress may be more comfortable for some than a traditional inner-spring mattress.Choose a mattress store that offers a satisfaction guarantee and a return policy. It can take several weeks to adjust to your new mattress. If your back pain does not improve after several weeks of sleeping on the mattress, you may wish to return it.;
, If you can't afford to buy a new bed right now, you can make your bed more supportive by using plywood slats. Place these between your box spring and mattress. You can also place your mattress directly on the floor.


You may find that a memory foam or latex mattress pad also makes your bed more supportive. These are cheaper options than replacing your mattress if you can’t afford the large expense immediately., Shop for a pillow that is tailored to the way you sleep, selecting either a side or back pillow. Consider a body pillow or a king-sized pillow to place between your legs if you're a side-sleeper."

Get your blood flowing.,
Make sure your shoulder isn't injured.,
Move your shoulders in all directions.,
First stretch your chest muscles.,
Stretch your trapezius muscles by performing lateral neck flexions.,
Stretch your rhomboid muscles.,
For a more advanced stretch, try the back scratcher towel stretch.",How to Perform Shoulder Stretches," Make sure your muscles are warm before you attempt to stretch or exercise them. Hold your arms straight out in front of you with your elbows locked. Then slowly pull your arms back, bringing your shoulder blades together to form a T.









Taking a warm shower, applying moist heat or simply jogging on the spot for a few minutes before attempting any stretching is a good idea because your shoulder muscles will be more pliable and less apt to tear.Increasing your heart rate by any cardiovascular exercise will pump more warm blood into virtually all of your muscles, including those surrounding your shoulder joint.;
, Trying to stretch your shoulder if it's injured typically isn't a good idea, unless it's just a mild muscle strain.If you experience intense sharp pain with shoulder movement, which is indicative of a joint sprain, then consult a health professional (your doctor, chiropractor, or physiotherapist) before proceeding with any stretches or exercises.









Mild muscle strains respond well to some light stretching because it relieves muscle tension, promotes blood flow and improves flexibility.
Shoulder joints that are most often sprained include the glenohumeral and acromioclavicular (or AC) joints.
Applying ice to any sprained joint will help decrease inflammation caused from a sprain and numb the pain.

, Once you're properly warmed up and pretty sure that there's no significant injury lurking in your shoulder, then prepare for some global mobilizations in all directions. Go slow at first, maintain control of the movements and remember to inhale and exhale deeply.Muscle fibers need oxygen to be able to move and do work.









Lift your arms so they are parallel to the floor and then rotate them in large circles in the forward direction for about 15 seconds, then reduce the size of the circles (make them tighter) for a further 15 seconds. After a few seconds rest, switch and do the opposite direction.
Shrug your shoulders as high as you can, trying to touch your ears, and then let them drop and fully relax. At the top of your shrug, hold for about five seconds and repeat ten times.

, These muscles are chronically tight and pull your shoulder forward.









Stand near a doorway and lift your arm, holding it straight and parallel to the floor. Grab on to the frame of the door and gently lean forward, which will extend your arm behind your shoulder and create a stretch in your chest, upper arm and anterior deltoid muscles. Hold for 30 seconds, then switch and do the other side. Repeat three to five times consecutively.

,









The upper trapezius is a large superficial muscle that extends from the top of your neck (and base of your skull) to the shoulder blade and tip of your shoulder.It's mainly involved when you shrug your shoulders and commonly gets sore and stiff in response to stress. This is one of the most common muscle groups to hold tension, making it very tight (even causing headaches). Do this stretch for 10 to 15 seconds.

, Find a pole or another sturdy object to grab. Relax your shoulders as you pull back, extending your arms to feel the stretch between your shoulder blades. Hold for 10 to 30 seconds.









The rhomboid muscles are in the upper portion of your back and attach your shoulder blades to your thoracic spine — they're responsible for retracting your shoulder blades.These muscles often get sore from poor posture (slouching) and sitting too long at the computer.

, This position is a little more complicated and requires some flexibility. It stretches the internal rotators on the front side of the shoulder joint, external rotators on back side of shoulder joint, and the triceps on back side of the upper arm. It’s important to keep your neck and thoracic spine as straight as possible during this stretch. Do four sets of eight to 12 reps.









Grab a small towel and bend one arm over your head, feeding the towel down your back. Then, bend the other arm around and up your back to grab the loose end of the towel. Pull the towel up and down while maintaining tension. Repeat three to five times consecutively and switch sides.

Rest and elevate your leg.,
Apply ice to your knee initially.,
Use crutches to move around.,
Take your medications as advised.,
Consider moist heat after the acute stage.,
Seek out physiotherapy.,
Use a continuous passive motion machine.,
Consider infrared therapy.,
Try acupuncture treatments.,
Get a deep tissue massage.,
Experiment with vibration therapy.",How to Manage Pain After Knee Replacement Surgery," Once you're discharged from the hospital, you'll be told to rest and elevate your leg for the first few days or so in order to help decrease swelling and inflammation, which also reduces pain.While sitting on the sofa or a chair, prop your leg up with some pillows, but try not to hyperextend your knee and risk straining it — keep some flexion in the joint while resting. Consider putting a pillow under your knee at night while you sleep on your back to elevate the extremity.


Total bed rest is not a good idea post-surgery because some movement (even in surrounding joints such as the hip and ankle) is needed to stimulate blood flow and healing.
Wearing compression stockings can be another effective method for reducing achy pain and swelling, and preventing blood clot formation. Start wearing them day and night, then after a few weeks, switch to just while you sleep.
There are two types of knee replacements: total knee replacements and partial knee replacements. Recovery from a total replacement takes longer — generally three to five days in the hospital and a recovery period lasting from one to three months.;
, While your knee is still in the acute phase (significant inflammation and pain), apply ice to it. The application of ice is an effective treatment for essentially all acute musculoskeletal injuries.Cold therapy should be applied to the area around the incision in order to reduce the swelling and pain, particularly in the muscles. Ice should be applied for 20 minutes every two to three hours for a couple of days, then reduce the frequency as the pain and swelling subside.


Compressing the ice against your knee with a bandage or elastic support will also help control the inflammation, but don't tie it too tight because complete restriction of blood flow could cause more damage to your knee joint and lower leg.
Always wrap ice or frozen gel packs in a thin towel in order to prevent frostbite on your skin.
If you don't have any ice or gel packs, then use a frozen bag of veggies from your freezer.

, For the first few weeks post-surgery, try to use your crutches (which are typically supplied by the hospital) while walking around so as to not inflame your knee. Some knee mobility after a few days post-op is a good idea, but total weight bearing while walking should be postponed for a week or two until the muscles surrounding the knee have started to heal and gain their back strength.


You should be able to resume most normal activities of daily living (including walking and bending) within 3-6 weeks following knee replacement surgery.Some pain with walking and other knee movements, particularly at night, is common for several weeks after you've had knee surgery.
If your right knee was replaced, then don't try to drive a car until you're fully recovered, which may take a few months. Your orthopedist will clear you when it is safe for you to drive.

, You'll likely receive pain medication (either orally or intravenously) while in the hospital and then given strong prescription drugs to take home. These medications may include strong opioids, such as morphine, fentanyl or oxycodone, which may have to be taken for a few weeks.Medication is an important part of managing your pain, so follow your doctor's instructions carefully and be aware that abuse of pain medications can lead to dependency.


Alternatively, you may be given prescription-strength nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen or naproxen, or painkillers such as Tylenol #3. After a few weeks, you may be able to wean yourself to weaker over-the-counter offerings.
Be careful not to take any medications on an empty stomach, as they can irritate the lining of your stomach and increase the risk of stomach ulcers.
Pain-relieving creams containing capsaicin, menthol and/or salicylate may be of benefit also.
Your doctor may also prescribe short-term antibiotics to reduce the risk of infection.

, After the inflammation and pain in and around your knee has largely subsided, then consider applying some moist heat. The application of heat causes mild dilatation of blood vessels and helps to alleviate any stiffness. Microwaved herbal bags work well and are often infused with aromatherapy (such as lavender) that has relaxing properties.


With the permission of your doctor, soak your leg in a warm Epsom salt bath, which can significantly reduce pain and swelling, especially within muscles.The magnesium in the salt helps the muscles relax.
However, avoid soaking the wound in water until it has completely sealed and dried., Physical therapy is an extremely important part of rehabbing after knee surgery and can begin as soon as 48 hours post-op.after surgery. A physical therapist can show you specific and tailored stretches, mobilizations and strengthening exercises for your recuperating knee. Knee immobilizers are often used to stabilize the knee while undergoing physical therapy.


Physiotherapy is usually required 2-3x per week for 6-8 weeks to positively impact a knee that's undergone surgery.It will include a graduated walking program and knee-strengthening exercises.
If need be, a physical therapist can stimulate, contract and strengthen your weakened leg muscles with electrotherapy, such as electronic muscle stimulation.
For pain control, a physical therapist can use a TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) unit on your knee.

, A device that can help speed knee recovery and reduce stiffness is the continuous passive motion (CPM) machine.The CPM machine is attached to the recuperating leg and automatically moves the knee through various motions for up to an hour or so while the patient relaxes. This type of passive exercise can improve circulation and reduce the risk of scarring / contracture of the soft tissues surrounding the knee.


CPM exercise machines also help to prevent blood clot formation in the legs.
Some physical therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists (rehabilitation physicians) have CPM machines in their office, but not all of them.

, The use of low-energy light waves (infrared) is known to be able to speed up the healing of wounds, decrease pain and decrease inflammation.Use of infrared radiation (either through a hand-held device or within a special sauna) is believed to penetrate deep into the body and improve circulation because it creates heat and dilates blood vessels.


In most cases, significant pain reduction can start within hours after the first infrared treatment.
Pain reduction is often long lasting, weeks or even months.
Practitioners most likely to use infrared therapy include some chiropractors, osteopaths, physical therapists and massage therapists.

, Acupuncture involves sticking very thin needles into specific energy points within the skin / muscle in efforts to reduce pain and inflammation and to potentially stimulate healing.Acupuncture is not commonly recommended for pain control post surgery and should only be considered as a secondary option, but anecdotal reports suggest it can be helpful for many different types of musculoskeletal injuries. It's worth a try if your budget allows for it.


Based on the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture reduces pain and inflammation by releasing a variety of substances including endorphins and serotonin.
Acupuncture is practiced by a variety of health professionals including some physicians, chiropractors, naturopaths, physical therapists and massage therapists — whoever you choose should be certified by NCCAOM.

, Knee replacement surgery involves cutting into the muscles surrounding the knee joint in order to clean it up and resurface the ends of the bones. As such, the muscles experience severe trauma, which leads to inflammation and spasm post surgery. A deep tissue massage is helpful starting a few weeks after surgery because it reduces muscle spasm, combats inflammation and promotes relaxation.Start with a 30 minute leg massage, focusing on your thigh and hamstring muscles. Allow the therapist to go as deep as you can tolerate without wincing.


Always drink lots of water immediately following a massage in order to flush out inflammatory by-products and lactic acid from your body. Failure to do so might cause a headache or mild nausea.

, An interesting alternative option in managing musculoskeletal pain is vibrational therapy. Vibrating frequencies seem to relax and strengthen musculature while stimulate nerves to reduce pain. In terms of knee pain, you can vibrate primarily the knee area or the entire body — both have proven effective for reducing knee pain.Full-body vibrating machines are difficult to find in rehabilitation facilities and likely too expensive to buy for home use, so consider smaller machines that vibrate your feet and/or lower legs.
A hand-held vibrating massage device is another option that may work well to stimulate and reduce pain in the muscles around your knee.

Do knee raises.,
Try hip abduction.,
Do hip extensions.",How to Continue Therapy at Home After a Hip Replacement2," After the two to three days following your surgery, you can start doing more extensive exercises with your doctor’s permission. These include standing exercises that will help you get your strength back in your knees and hips, such as knee raises. Stand up while holding firmly onto your support, such as a chair or secure railing. Bend your knee and raise it as far as you can towards your waist. Hold your knee up for five counts, then slowly lower your knee.


Repeat the same on your other leg. Then repeat the whole cycle 10 times at least three to four times a day.
Make sure you have a chair within sitting reach in case you get tired or feel you may fall during any of these exercises.Always ask your doctor if you are ready to take on new exercises before you do them.

, Hip abductions work on your hip's range of motion to the side. Stand up while holding firmly onto your support. Raise your leg a few inches off the floor to the side, keeping your back and body straight. Hold for five counts, then slowly lower your leg. Repeat the same motion on your other leg.


Do 10 repetitions on each leg, three to four times a day. , Hip extensions work your leg and hip's range of motion to the back. Stand up while holding onto something sturdy for support, such as a chair or wall. Raise your leg a few inches off the floor behind you, keeping your back and body straight. Hold your position for five counts, then slowly lower your leg. Repeat the same exercise on your other leg.


Do 10 repetitions on each leg at least three to four times a day. "

Plan ahead.,
Put extra support rails in your home.,
Secure your bathroom.,
Get proper seating.,
Buy dressing aids.,
Secure frequented areas.,
Get supplies for wound care.,
Have the right foods in your house.,
Fill your prescriptions.",How to Continue Therapy at Home After a Hip Replacement3," When you learn that you are going to need hip replacement surgery, you need to get your house ready for your recovery. You should plan this before you have your surgery because you don't want to have to deal with it during your recovery.


You may also need to go ahead and hire someone to help you for the two to four weeks after you return home.

, When you come home from your surgery, you are going to need some extra support to get around areas of your house. You should install safety bars in your bath, shower, and toilet. These are the areas where you will be the most likely to fall, which means you will need extra support since you won't be firm on your feet.


Make sure the handrails on any of your stairs are secure. This is true for inside stairs and those on the outside of your house. If you don't have any on your stairs, install them.For those areas without handrails, you will need to use a walker or crutches., In addition to extra railings, you need to put in some extra safety precautions in your bathroom. Get a raised toilet seat that will make it easier to sit down on your toilet. If you have severe mobility problems, you may need to get a portable urinal or toilet chair, sometimes called a potty chair.


For your shower, get a plastic chair to put inside so you can sit down instead of stand.
You should also replace your stationary shower head with a hand-held model so it will be easier for you to rinse off in the shower., When you have your hip replaced, you will need some extra help sitting as well. This means you need to get a firm seat cushion for the chair that you sit in all the time. Your chair should also allow your knees to be lower than your hips to aid in the healing process.


Also make sure that the chair has a firm back support as well., You will need some help getting dressed while you are recovering, since it will be hard for you to bend over and reach certain parts of your body. To help with dressing, buy a dressing stick, a sock aid, and a long-handled shoe horn. This will help you put on and take off pants, socks, and shoes.


These can be found at medical specialty stores and many shoe stores., You will have trouble getting around easily when you get home from surgery. This means you need to clear the way. Remove any objects that may trip you up in these common areas. This includes electrical cords, carpet edges, pet toys, or errant furniture.


So you don't have to move around as much, set up an area near where you will likely spend a lot of your time where you can keep your phone, chargers, drinks, books, computer, TV, movies and snacks that is convenient for you to get to., While you recover, you will have to take care of your post-surgery wounds. You or the person you hire to take care of you will be advised by your doctor of how to take care of them. You may have stitches or staples, which need to be kept dry and clean at all times.


These will stay in your skin for about two weeks after surgery.

, While you are recovering from your surgery, you will need to eat the right things. When you first come home, you will need to eat light broths and soups at first. After a day or two, you can start eating small amounts of normal food and eat more frequently.Surgery can cause constipation, so make sure you get lots of fiber to prevent this.You also need to drink plenty of water, which will keep you hydrated and help with constipation.

, Your doctor will likely prescribe a blood thinning medication for you to take after the surgery. It is important to take blood thinners to reduce your risk of blood clots and pulmonary embolism following your surgery.You may also receive a prescription for pain medication to help control your pain after the procedure.

Get these prescriptions filled as soon as possible and follow your doctor’s instructions for use.

Learn what happens during hip replacement.,
Recognize the causes of hip deterioration.,
Notice the symptoms of hip pain.,
Determine what activities to resume.",How to Continue Therapy at Home After a Hip Replacement4," Hip replacement surgery removes damaged portions of your hip joint, such as the ball part of your femur or the socket part in your pelvis. It then replaces these deteriorated parts with artificial parts. This can be painful because your hip is one of the largest joints in your body.It can be replaced by metal or ceramic parts.

, There are some conditions that can lead to hip deterioration. The most common cause of this deterioration is osteoarthritis in the hip. Other causes include:


Rheumatoid arthritis.
Osteonecrosis, caused from bone death due to insufficient blood supply to the hip.
Injury.
Fractures.
Bone tumors., You may not know that you have any of the issues that cause hip deterioration or know when it is bad enough to need replacement. Most people need to undergo hip replacement if their joint is deteriorated enough to cause extreme pain that interfere with daily activities. These symptoms include:


Hip pain that limits your daily activities, such as walking or bending.
Hip pain that occurs even while resting, during either the day or night.
Enough hip stiffness that it limits your ability to move or lift the leg.
Pain bad enough that adequate pain relief cannot be received from anti-inflammatory drugs, such as NSAIDs, physical therapy, or by using walking supports., Once you have your hip replacement, you will likely experience far less pain and be able to move your hip much better. This means that you will want to start doing your normal exercises and activities again. Low impact activities, such as walking, swimming, golfing, biking, and some forms of dancing will be great activities for you to do.


High impact activities, such as jogging, playing basketball, or playing tennis generally are not recommended, even after you recover."
"
Wear your cast or brace for the entire time designated by your surgeon.,
Use the crutches provided.,
Take any pain meds prescribed by your doctor.,
Schedule and attend your follow-up appointments.,
Start wearing shoes with proper support.,
Use ice to reduce discomfort.,
Attend any physical therapy appointments.,
Restrict all running and impact sports for at least three months.",How to Recover From Plantar Fasciitis Surgery2," Consistent use of your cast or brace is necessary in order to allow your fascia to fully recover. Even if you feel better and there is little to no pain when you put your full weight on your feet, it is still necessary to allow complete recovery. No pain and increased mobility does not mean your body has healed 100 percent. You can expect to wear the cast or boot for two to three weeks. Your surgeon will likely tell you to stay off your feet completely except for when eating or using the bathroom for the first week or two.You should also keep the foot and bandage completely dry to reduce the risk of infection., Though you should stay off your feet completely as often as you can manage it, your doctor will provide crutches for you to use when you must get up.Use them consistently to help aid you in keeping weight off your foot.

, Though not highly invasive, the open nature of the procedure will still result in pain during your recovery. Your doctor will likely prescribe pain medication to help keep you more comfortable during the initial recovery time. Take your pain meds as directed when you are experiencing pain. If the pain is unrelieved, contact your doctor.


Your doctor will have you switch to over-the-counter pain medication once your prescription runs out. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen can help manage pain., Your surgeon will schedule follow-up appointments to monitor the progress of your recovery and to determine when to remove the cast or boot on your foot. Make sure you attend these appointments, and do not remove the cast or boot before your doctor gives the okay.

, Once your doctor removes the cast/boot, he will give the okay for you to start wearing shoes again as soon as it’s comfortable for you to do so. Since surgery is a last resort, you will likely already have custom orthotic inserts for your shoes. Continue to use them after the surgery to provide the proper form and support to your foot as it continues to heal., Once your foot is out of the cast, you can also ice it to help reduce discomfort, especially after being on your feet for a long period of time. One method is to place a frozen water bottle under your foot while rolling your foot along it.

Perform progressive muscle relaxation.,
Take a short Qigong or Tai Chi break.,
Use one-third of your strength.",How to Manage Chronic Pain at Work1," When pain hits, your body naturally changes its breathing pace to an agitated level.

Understand the concept of acupressure.,
Learn what to use acupressure for.,
Dedicate time to acupressure.",How to Do Acupressure1," Acupressure is an Asian Bodywork Therapy developed over 5,000 years ago. Acupressure relies on finger placement and pressure along pressure points on the body.The points are believed to be arranged along channels, called meridians. Stimulating these areas is believed to release tension and increase blood flow.Some people believe that acupressure and other Asian body therapies correct imbalances and blockages of the flow of vital energies through our bodies.;
, Acupressure is used for a variety of ailments. One of the most common uses is to relieve pain, such as headaches and neck and back pain. People also use acupressure to help with nausea and vomiting, fatigue, mental and physical stress, weight loss, and even addiction. Acupressure is believed to cause deep relaxation and a decrease in muscle tension. Many doctors, practitioners, and advocates of holistic health believe that acupressure has positive and healing effects on the body.UCLA has a Center for East-West Medicine that studies the scientific basis of acupressure. They try to provide explanations and practical applications of the techniques.To become a licensed acupressurist, one must go through a rigorous program at special acupressure and acupuncture schools. They can also go through massage therapy programs. These programs include study of anatomy and physiology, acupressure points and meridians, technique and protocol, and Chinese medicine theory, . These programs require up to 500 hours of schooling., If you want to use acupressure, you need to repeat the steps over time. The techniques have a cumulative effect on the body. Each time you manipulate the pressure points, you help balance your body.


Some people may see results immediately, some may need several treatments. Although immediate pain relief may occur, the pain can return. This is considered normal. Acupressure is not an immediate fix. It is technique you can use to help ease pain by decreasing blockages and restoring your body to a balanced condition.You can apply acupressure as frequently as you want. Multiple times a day or even multiple times an hour. As you continually manipulate a point, you may feel a lack of pain as it begins to heal.
Most people suggest practicing acupressure every day. If that is impossible, then practice at least 2-3 times a week."

Use the right amount of force.,
Use the correct pressing aids.,
Press the area.,
Press for the appropriate length of time.,
Release the pressure point gradually.,
Perform acupressure when your body is in the right state.",How to Do Acupressure2," Use a deep, firm pressure when you are stimulating the points.The amount of pressure you place onto your body depends on your overall health. When pressing, you might feel a bit of soreness or pain, but it should be a balance between pain and pleasure.


Some points will feel tense; others will feel sore or ache when you press them. If you feel extreme or increasing pain, gradually decrease the pressure until you feel a balance of pain and pleasure.
Do not think of acupressure as increasing your endurance to pain. If something is so painful it's too uncomfortable or excruciating, then stop., Acupressure most commonly uses the fingers to massage, rub, and stimulate the pressure points. Knuckles, elbows, knees, legs, and feet can also be used.The middle finger is the best for applying pressure to the pressure points. It is the longest and strongest of your fingers. People also use the thumb, too.
To correctly manipulate a pressure point, use something blunt. For some pressure points, the fingers may be too thick. Objects that have a 3-4 mm thickness, like used pencil eraser, are ideal. Other objects you can use are an avocado pit or a golf ball.
Some pressure points can be pressed using a fingernail., When you press the area, you are reinforcing it. This is the most common acupressure method. To do this, use a blunt object. Don't rub or massage the area; instead, hold the point with steady pressure.


If you are pulling the skin, the angle of the pressure is incorrect. You want to apply the pressure at the center of the point.Make sure to press on the right spot. These acupressure points are very small, so they have to be precise. If you don't feel any effects, then try different spots.
When performing acupressure, you want to look for sore pressure points. If there is no blockage, you won't feel any effect from pressing the point and won't need to treat it.Relaxing can also help emphasize the effects., Acupressure employs steady presses to the pressure points. By pressing a point for only half a second, your body will start to respond. This is a good way to try to find the pressure points when just beginning.To get the full effect of acupressure, press for at least 2-3 minutes.
If your hand gets tired, slowly withdraw the pressure, shake your hand, and breathe deeply. Then reapply the pressure., After holding the pressure point for the desired amount of time, slowly release the point. Don't just yank your hand away. Releasing the point gradually is believed to allow the tissues to heal by giving them time to respond to the release in pressure.


Most believe that the gradual pressing and releasing of pressure points help make the treatments more effective., Acupressure should be performed when you are relaxed, preferably in a private place. You can sit or lie down when administering acupressure. Try to cut out outside distractions and stress. Turn off cell phones and play relaxing music. Use aromatherapy. Try any technique that will promote relaxation.


Wear comfortable, loose clothing. Any kind of restricting clothing, like belts, tight pants, or even shoes, can obstruct the circulation.
You shouldn't use acupressure techniques right before a big meal or on a full stomach. Wait for at least an hour after eating so that you don't get nauseated.
Don't drink iced drinks because that can counteract the effects of acupressure. Instead, drink hot herbal tea afterwards.Wait at least half an hour after heavy exercise or taking a bath."

Obtain a Launch Box.,
Know the features of the Launch Box and its accessories.,
Grind your material.,
Fill the trench up to the inner side rails.,
Close the lid.,
Insert the positive end of a battery into the battery hole.,
Insert the glass stem into the draw hole.,
Wrap your dominant hand around the Launch Box and hold it up to eye level.,
Squeeze your hand to engage the battery and hold for 3-5 seconds until you see vapor forming.,
Without releasing the battery, place your lips on the stem and inhale slowly (this is known as ""drawing"").,
Relax your hand to disengage the battery and inhale slightly faster for a few seconds to capture the remaining vapor in the Box.

,
Hold in the vapor for several seconds, then exhale.,
""Turn, tumble, and tap"".,
Repeat the process until the trench is finished.,
Clean the box after each completed trench.,
Clean the glass stem periodically using cotton swabs and isopropyl alcohol.",How to Use the Magic Flight Launch Box," It can be ordered from the Magic Flight website, or from online stores like Amazon.;
, The kit comes with the Launch Box, two batteries with rubber protective caps, a battery charger, a cleaning brush, and a glass stem used to inhale the vapor.The actual Launch Box contains the following features:




The trench, which consists of a screen to contain the material.
The lid, which is often engraved with a design and must be closed for effective vaporization. The lid locks in place to contain the vapor.
A draw hole, where the vapor is formed and inhaled.
A light, which is located within the draw hole and acts a battery life indicator (the dimmer the light, the less charge the battery has).
The battery hole, where the battery is held and engaged to use the device. It contains a rubber pushback ring that prevents the battery from accidentally engaging when not in use.



, Optimally, you'll want to obtain an extremely fine grind to achieve even vaporization. Make sure the herbs are completely dry, as well.


A coarse grind doesn't have enough surface area to vaporize effectively. By grinding the herb finely, the surface area is increased to allow for even vaporization.

, Make sure not to overfill or underfill the trench. Avoid packing the material with your fingers; vaporization is most effective when the herbs sit loosely in the trench.

, Again, the key to effective vaporization is closing the lid to contain the vapor. Make sure it locks into place to keep the vapor from escaping.

, Remove the cap first, then insert it into the hole, positive end first. The rubber pushback ring will prevent the battery from engaging until you're ready to take a hit.


Placing the rubber cap on the negative end of the battery will make engaging the battery more comfortable for your hands.

, This is optional, but recommended for beginners. Using the Launch Box without the stem is known as ""native mode.""

, You should be able to peek inside the stem and/or draw hole. The negative end of the battery should be against your palm.

, If you can see the light through the draw hole, the battery is engaging and vaporization is in progress.

, You should be inhaling until 80% of your lung capacity is reached (about ten seconds).


It helps to understand the relationship between the draw rate and the temperature of the trench. When you inhale faster, the trench cools due to more airflow passing over the screen. When you inhale more slowly (or stop inhaling completely), the temperature increases as long as the battery is engaged. The key to a perfect hit is balancing the draw rate and trench temperature.

You should also know the effects of your draw speed. Too fast and the trench will be too cool to produce vapor; too slow and you run the risk of igniting the herbs (see Warnings section).


Sense the heat of the vapor on your tongue and use it to control your draw speed. Ideally, the vapor should be warm without causing throat irritation, and the draw rate should be fast enough so that vapor doesn't collect in the chamber (vapor should be inhaled as it is being formed).

,,


To achieve a successful hit, inhale until you reach 80% of your lung capacity (about ten seconds) and hold it in for the remaining 20%.
The Launch Box was designed to maximize efficiency by producing only as much vapor as the lungs are likely to naturally absorb. Excess vapor upon exhalation indicates it was not fully absorbed into the body. This also may lead to additional smell.

, For even vaporization, it's recommended to tumble your load after each draw.


After removing the battery and stem, turn the Launch Box upside-down and tap on the sides to dislodge the herbs from the trench.

Tumble the load by shaking the Box side-to-side.

Tap the sides of the Box to settle the herbs back into the trench.

, If even vaporization was consistently achieved, the trench is considered finished when the herbs turn a uniform brown color. The smell of popcorn is also a good indicator of a finished trench.

, Open the lid, turn the Launch Box over, and empty out the trench. Brush the screen gently with the cleaning brush. Close your eyes and sharply blow against the screen to remove any remaining particles.


For most users, basic cleaning should be enough. For more in-depth cleaning, dip the brush or cotton swab into 99% isopropyl alcohol and rub it against the screen. Make sure not to use too much alcohol as it may drip through the screen and produce an unpleasant taste for the next couple of trenches (though this goes away after use).

, Dip one end of a cotton swab into the alcohol and insert it back and forth into the stem to scrub away the oily residue. Repeat with water to remove all traces of the alcohol.

There are many rehab centers that can help you to effectively overcome your addiction. Similarly many hospitals provide treatment for this kind of addiction.
Although checking yourself into a hospital or rehab center may not sound appealing, it's important to accept that most people are not able to kick their drug habit on their own - they need to a firm support system.
This is especially important when the withdrawal symptoms kick in. When you're in a hospital or rehab center, you will not have access to the drugs and you will have doctors and fellow patients to turn to for support and guidance. If you try to detox at home, your resolve is likely to break as soon as the intense cravings kick in.

, To begin the detoxification process, the amount of ritalin is decreased little by little in order to gradually detoxify the body. This is usually carried out under the supervision and guidance of a physician. It's important that you are mentally prepared for the cravings and withdrawal symptoms that are about to take place. You can get through your detox in the following ways:


Tell the physician about your condition so that adequate drugs that can help you manage your withdrawal symptoms can be provided.
Use massage. Massage is often useful for body aches during detoxification as it helps in soothing the body and helping it to get over the pain.
Try to spend time in a constructive way so that you are left with less time to think about the drug and how much you want.
Focus on the long term goal of gaining back a healthy life free of drugs, rather than immediate gratification.

, For successful treatment of Ritalin addiction, one-on-one therapy is required by a psychologist.


This is aimed at the specific needs of the addicted person, especially if there is an additional problem or problems beside drug addiction. The addict is free to privately approach his therapist on a daily basis.
The addict gets counseling and keen attention with no chance of disclosure to others about his addiction. Honesty is the core demand for complete recovery.

, In addition to individual therapy, joining larger groups all going through same problems could be of great help to the addict. In group therapy, the patients are encouraged to share their feelings and problems, so they do not feel alone.


Group therapy or counseling is done once a week in the initial stages of rehab or psychological treatment. Later, it is held once a month for a year or more as required. In group therapy, the person does not feel condemned as all others have the same issues. The person feels accepted and relapse does not occur.
The person shares with other addicts having treatments about how he started taking the drugs, what were the causes that forced him to use drugs. They share their difficulties in dealing with the withdrawal symptoms and cravings. They support each other and give confidence.
All addicts are taught better life skills and trouble meeting strategies. They are taught how to cope with stress. Cognitive behavior therapies are learnt and practiced together.
A combination of one-on-one and group therapies work best for the treatment of an addict person.

, This type of therapy focuses on helping the person while providing support and empathy from his family and relatives. Family members are taught how to deal effectively with the patient and how to help him come out of addiction.

, It's important to know the causes that forced you to take the drug in the first place. If the reason was the desire to achieve better performance in school, college or work, try to be realistic. Don’t impose achievement levels or goals that are beyond your potentials and capabilities.


If your parents are too demanding and exert pressure on you, talk to them and tell them that getting the grades they demand is causing you too much stress and that you are trying your best.
Also keep in mind that most successful people in the world are not those who were always the top of their class, instead most of them were average students. Outstanding grades do not promise a superb future - your future is what you make of it.
If the reason is some role conflict or family problem, you should try to resolve it, don’t feel scared or embarrassed, talk to your family and tell them how you feel. They should understand. Let them know that their behavior sometimes hurts or upsets you,causing you to turn to the drugs.

, This initial time is very difficult as the craving for the drug is at its peak. During this time you have to be the most strongest. Follow some simple steps to help you get over your craving


Do not think excessively about Ritalin, it can lead you to take the drug again because of the negative thought cycle around the drug.
Do not go to places or spend time in the company of those who either use the drug or remind you of drug, as this may enhance your cravings.
Do exercise as it releases endorphins (natural pleasure-producing chemicals) in the body.
Try to distract yourself through any activity, you have to be your own supervisor.
Think about the pros and cons of taking Ritalin. It will help you identify that the benefits of staying clean far outweigh the benefits of taking the drug.
Focus on the long-term benefits of staying clean - like being successful in school or work, maintaining good relationships with your friends and family.
Take a warm bath and give yourself a massage - it makes the body feel more relaxed and relieves pain.
Drink coffee, as it can be effective in reducing cravings.

, Choose a friend circle that is supportive and encouraging. This is very important while trying to get over a Ritalin addiction. A strong support group can help you out in the following ways:


You can talk to them whenever your cravings are at their peak, and ask them for advice and encouragement when you feel like you cannot handle your issues alone.
You can ask them to hold you accountable, by letting them know where you are, what you're doing and how you are feeling at all times.
You can ask your healthy, supportive group of friends to keep you away from any previous groups of people who encouraged your drug use or supplied you with Ritalin.

, This is very important, as while you were using most of your activities revolved around taking the addictive drugs. Now that Ritalin is out of the picture, you need to plan out your new, clean life and have something to work towards. Here are some useful tips :


Set yourself short-term and long-term goals - whether it's getting into your chosen college or job, running a 5K race or learning a new skill.
Make amends with any family members or friends that you may have hurt or ignored while you were using. Apologizing for past behavior is never easy, but you will feel much happier and lighter afterwards.

However, some people will go as far as giving unsolicited advice and comments. Try to avoid possibly escalating the situation by remaining gracious throughout the encounter.For example, if someone were to tell you, “Don’t you know that smoking is bad for you?”, you could offer a response like, “Yes, I do. Thanks for your concern,” and then walk away.

, Outpatient care means you'll meet with your care team regularly, but you won't live in a treatment center. It can be effective if your withdrawal symptoms are mild. Outpatient care is cheaper, and it might be more practical if you have responsibilities at home or if you have a strong support team who can look out for you throughout the day and night.


You may be prescribed drugs like buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP/NX) or clonidine and naltrexone.
Outpatient detoxification may take one or two weeks.
After detox, consider intensive outpatient treatment, in which you spend the day in the hospital but go home at night.

It is called rapid detoxification because it only takes four to eight hours, but it is often considered to have too many risks for most patients. Ask your doctor about this procedure if you have made several attempts at detoxification and if your withdrawal symptoms are severe.Other versions of rapid detoxification include ultra-rapid detoxification and stepped rapid detoxification.
These are all expensive and risky procedures, and your doctor may advise against them.They are typically not covered by US insurers, nor by the NHS in the UK because of the high costs, risks (including death) and uncertain outcomes.Patients are typically discharged afterward, so make sure you have a follow up plan to maintain your sobriety.

, Most self-directed detoxes result in relapse.However, if you are unable to access inpatient or outpatient treatment, you may try to get off opiates on your own. It is a method that many people attempt, and some, perhaps those more recently addicted, find it to be all they need.Rally a committed support team. Arrange for friends and family to check in on you, make sure you aren't abusing the medications you're using to detox, and encourage you in your efforts.
Detoxing can lead to suicidal thoughts, so you need people who will check on you and also come to you quickly.
Use over-the-counter drugs like ibuprofen for muscle aches.
For bowel control, you can use Imodium, which contains a mild opiate.
Use the over-the-counter drugs exactly as the instructions say — do not take more or more frequently than the manufacturer's instructions.

, Withdrawal might make you feel queasy, sleepless, sweaty, anxious, and otherwise unwell. Inpatient programs are equipped to help you through the day, but you'll still have to work on your own to recognize your body's needs.


Stay close to bathrooms. Opiates make you constipated, and detoxing can make your bowel movements frequent and unpredictable.Get help sleeping. You can ask your inpatient or outpatient doctor for medicine to help you sleep at night, as withdrawal can make this difficult.
If you are experiencing severe symptoms, such as vomiting or aspiration (breathing stomach content into the lungs), call a doctor or visit a hospital for treatment there.
Do not hesitate to go to the hospital. Deaths during opiate withdrawal have occurred, and you are at particular risk if you are also detoxing from another substance, like alcohol. Err on the side of safety and get professional help.

At your visits, you will likely develop goals the person would like to reach, and will discuss upon subsequent visits whether or not you have achieved them. Therapy also provides a safe place for your loved one to discuss, with family, their fears and anxieties about staying off drugs., Encourage your loved one to join a 12-step program to receive support from others while attempting to remain sober. A program like Cocaine Anonymous emphasizes responsibility for behavior, self-forgiveness, and making amends to others.This is often helpful when battling the demons and triggers that cause addicts to use. Such meetings encourage daily attendance for the first 90 days of sobriety.

, Suggest that your loved one commit to taking care of their physical and emotional health. Not only will this support their body during recovery, but it will also help them develop a more positive outlook on life.


Exercise like running, walking, yoga, and meditation can not only keep your loved one healthy, but can battle stress and keep the person balanced. Eating right and doing things they enjoy, such as painting, spending time with animals, and pampering enhance well-being, which may help the person want to stay sober., Know that battling addiction is often a life-long commitment. Talk to your loved one’s doctor about medication that may help them fight cravings, such as baclofen, tiagabine, topiramate, and disulfiram. There are also an assortment of behavioral strategies your loved one can implement to manage cravings.


Recovering addicts should also consider attending support group meetings regularly to help hold themselves accountable and get the help they need to stay clean."

Buy a pack of snus.,
Take a pouch out of the box.,
Insert the packet between your lip and gums.,
Don't spit.,
Store your Snus is a cool and dry area.",How to Use Snus," Snus comes in a few different varieties of strength, flavor and size. It's probably best to start with a lower strength variety unless you've already got a considerable nicotine tolerance from other tobacco products.


Strength labels are Normal, Stark, & Extra Stark. Stark varieties contain, on average, 11 mg of nicotine per gram while Extra Stark may contain up to 22mg of nicotine per gram.
Snus also comes in three different sizes: Mini, Normal/Large (most common) and Maxi.
Both Camel and Marlboro have Snus brands that come in lots of flavors, including mints and ""robust"" style natural flavors. They're known for long-lasting flavors, so pick something you'll like and know that it won't be particularly subtle.
Many users claim that real Swedish ""snus"" is much higher quality and prefer the taste. If you want to get some, make sure you get the pouches, because sometimes regular snuff is labeled ""snus"" in Sweden.;
, When you buy a tin of Snus, it will contain several small pouches of the snuff. Remove one for your use.


Unlike regular snuff, you don't have to shake the tin to ""pack"" the snuff or clump it. If you prefer, you can distribute the tobacco somewhat in the individual pouch with your fingers by squeezing the sachet a few times. Be gentle and don't tear the packet, however, if you choose to.

, Most Snus users elect to put the packet under their top lip on one side, but place it wherever it feels comfortable.


Some users will dry under the lip area for less saliva during use. If you want to, use your sleeve or a napkin to dry your under-upper lip area.
Some users with smaller mouths find it more comfortable to fold the packet in half (lengthwise or short wise) before packing it into their lip. Experiment some to fit it in comfortable for your mouth.

, Unlike to dip or snuff, it's not necessary to spit tobacco juice when dipping Snus, making it attractive to some users because it's less messy and makes it unnecessary to carry around an empty water bottle or mud-cup with you. Swallow normally and keep the Snus in your mouth as long as you enjoy the taste and buzz. Most users keep a pack in for 20 minutes to an hour.


Snus is a variety of ""wet snuff,"" meaning that the substance in the pouch contains only about 30 percent tobacco and 70 percent water and flavoring. Because of the existence of salt and flavoring, it promotes less saliva than other smokeless tobaccos.
You should start to notice the familiar tobacco head buzz soon. If you're an inexperienced tobacco user, you may start to feel a strong head-rush and some nausea, or even vomiting. This is a normal nicotine response. Spit out the packet if it starts nauseating you.
Always dispose of used snus in a trash can. Don't litter by spitting it out elsewhere.

, It's common to keep tins of Snus in the refrigerator to keep the taste and quality fresh. It'll last longer that way, and is commonly kept refrigerated in American tobacco stores.

Invest in a snuff box.,
Store in a cool, dry place.,
Keep out of reach of small children and pets.",How to Use Nasal Snuff2," A snuff box is a small storage container sold at many tobacco stores. It's purpose is to store snuff when you're not using. Snuff boxes are often easy to keep in your pocket or purse, so you can bring snuff with you when you go out.Snuff boxes vary greatly in price. Some are considered collector's items, and may be quite pricey. Others are less expensive and used as a basic storage tool. If you're just using a snuff box as a place to store your nasal snuff, you can opt for a cheaper, more practical box.
In the event you don't want to buy a snuff box, any small, sealable container can serve as a snuff box. You could use a small Tupperware container, for example.

, Snuff can last a long time when stored correctly. Choose a cool, dry place in your home. For example, you can store snuff in your basement if it tends to be colder there. You could also store snuff in a high drawer in your kitchen, where heat from the stove is unlikely to affect your snuff., Snuff is not safe for children or pets, who may inadvertently eat the product. Make sure to store your snuff in a place where children and pets will not find it. Keep it in a high drawer or a place in your bedroom that's off-limits to children and animals.

Be careful when using snuff to quit tobacco.,
Learn about the health risks.,
Recognize signs of tobacco dependency.,
Be aware of longterm nasal problems.",How to Use Nasal Snuff3," Many people use snuff as a way to transition away from tobacco altogether. You do not inhale snuff, and some studies indicate this makes it less addicting or dangerous than tobacco products. However, the results of such studies are debatable.If you want to use snuff to transition off of tobacco products, you should talk to a doctor first. Many doctors advise against using snuff to quit, as this may just create another bad habit.


Instead of snuff, some medical doctors may prescribe nicotine replacement sprays, patches, pills, or gums. Talk to your doctor about your options before settling on snuff as your route to quit., Many people believe nasal snuff does not come with the health risks associated with smoking. However, understand that snuff has similar health risks to tobacco. It increases your risk for heart disease, stroke, cirrhosis, all cancers, including lung cancer, and respiratory and digestive diseases. The risks are arguably slightly lower than smoking cigarettes, but still exist for smokeless tobacco products like snuff., Nasal snuff contains nicotine, which is a physically addictive substance. Recognize the signs of nicotine dependency. If you are displaying these signs, you may want to reevaluate your use of nasal snuff.You can become dependent on nasal snuff, making it difficult to quit. You may try to quit, but find you are unable to.
If you stop using snuff for a few days, you may experience withdrawal symptoms like irritability, strong cravings, anxiety, low mood, difficulty concentrating, and increased hunger.
You may keep using snuff even if health problems arise and your doctor recommends quitting.

, Over the longterm, using snuff can cause damage to your nasal cavities. As you're snorting snuff through your nose, your nostrils become irritated and damaged over time. Longterm users of snuff sometimes develop chronic rhinitis. This condition causes a persistent runny nose and blocked nasal passages."

Be of legal age to purchase tobacco.,
Decide what kind of smokeless tobacco you want.,
Get somewhere you can use the tobacco.,
Take a pinch of tobacco.,
Place between your gum and cheek.,
Let the tobacco sit in your mouth.,
Spit as necessary.,
Throw out the tobacco.",How to Use Dipping Tobacco," Laws governing tobacco products cover smokeless tobacco, and can vary by state across the US. Starting in 2016, the minimum age was raised to 21 in Hawaii. In addition, cities and towns in California, Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, and Ohio have all raised the age to 21. Make sure you know the proper age for your location.Smokeless tobacco is a legal product, but you don't want to enjoy it while breaking the law by pretending to be of age, or purchasing it for someone who is underage.;
, There are a variety of smokeless products out there. Their use is pretty similar, so your preference will really come down to personal taste.


Moist snuff. This tobacco has been fermented, aged, and finely chopped up. It is packed into tins. As the name suggests, this is slightly moistened, as opposed to dry snuff, which is powdery, and can be taken by sniffing it into your nose. This is the most common form of dipping tobacco sold in the US, and the kind you are most likely to see in stores.Loose-leaf tobacco. Another common form of chewing tobacco, these leaves have been dried and fermented, then sold in foil packets.Plug tobacco. In this form, the tobacco has been packed tightly together with molasses, or some other adhesive, into a block. You'll either cut or bit off a piece of the block to use it. You may also find twist tobacco, which a similar form where the tobacco has been braided into long strands.Snus. This is a newer form, originally developed in Scandinavia. The tobacco is put in individual packets, and may be flavored with a variety of sweeteners. There are differences between snus made in the United States compared to countries like Sweden, such as amount of tobacco in a packet, which can lead into differences in physical effects on your mouth., Compared to smoking, there are fewer restrictions on where you can use smokeless tobacco. Because you are going to be spitting, though, you will want to be somewhere where you can do that politely, or at least have a bottle or something you can spit into.


You don't want to be doing something physically active, as you'll want to avoid accidentally swallowing the tobacco or your spit. A relaxing activity like reading, watching television, or hanging out with friends, can be a good complement to dipping.
Avoid doing other things with your mouth while dipping, like eating or drinking. You don't want to mix your food with the dip.

, Reach your thumb and forefinger into the tin or pouch, or break off a piece of your plug. If you are a beginner to dipping, your pinch really should just be a small amount between your thumb and forefinger, probably about the size of a quarter. As you get more used to the taste and strength, the size of your pinch can grow, depending on how long you want it to sit in your mouth and how strong of dose of nicotine you are looking for.

, Take your tobacco and put it down in your mouth between your gums and cheek of your lower lip. Pack tightly together so you don't lose any of the leaves, and accidentally swallow them.Snus packets can also be held in the upper lip. The effect is roughly the same, though you may create more juice in your lower lip., Chewing tobacco works because the nicotine seeps into your bloodstream through your gums, rather than by inhaling smoke. Dipping tobacco can just sit in your mouth as long as you can feel something coming from it. You can get up to several hours worth of nicotine from a pinch of chewing tobacco, much longer lasting than a cigarette.If the tobacco starts to get loose, and you are worried about swallowing, use your finger or tongue to tamp it down back into place.

, Having something in your mouth will produce saliva, which will mix with the tobacco. You don't want to swallow this juice, and it is meant to be spit out.If you are outside, you can just spit onto the ground, but if you are indoors, keep an empty water bottle to spit into.


When using a spit bottle, it is better to replace the cap when you set it down. You don't want to accidentally knock it over and spill tobacco spit.#*Because the tobacco from snus packets can't get loose, the juice you make is meant to be swallowed.The flavoring used in snus can make it less irritating than juice from other forms of tobacco.

, Do not swallow your tobacco. Once you are finished with the tobacco, either because you don't feel any nicotine or you are doing something that requires a clean mouth, take it out of your mouth. Grab the tobacco with your hand, pull it out, then throw it away. If you are near enough to a garbage can, you can also spit out your tobacco. There's no reason to keep the tobacco any more.


Rinse your mouth. After you spit your dip out, you may want to rinse your mouth to get rid of any excess tobacco. Don’t use your spit bottle for rinsing, and be careful not to swallow the water you rinse with.

Remove the cap to your E-Liquid.,
Allow the cartomizer to set for a minute or two.,
Insert the plug.,

Use the cartomizer.,
Refill your cartomizer.,
Replace the cartomizer.",How to Use a Cartomizer," Talk to the salesperson to get a sense of which product would work best for you. Keep in mind that buying a starter kit with all of the relevant products, including a charger, might be a good way to start -- these start at around $20 and go up from there. If you just want to buy the parts, it could be much cheaper -- cartomizers can run less than $5, and then you purchase the juice in a variety of flavors starting at less than $5., A cartomizer is only one of a few different choices if you’re interested in using an e-cigarette. Cartomizers were developed to simplify the e-cigarette product, so they don’t have many pieces. They take more liquid than other products, and usually have a longer battery life. Keep in mind that they can often be fragile and typically last 1-2 weeks. , Talk to the salesperson and see what they have in stock, and what they would recommend for a beginning user. Keep in mind that the liquid comes in an array of flavors and amounts of nicotine. You will probably need to try a few different ones to figure out which one you like the best., Familiarize yourself with its design. Remove the rubber ends.

, These are typically white or clear. In the center of each plug is a tiny hole, which you need to pop out. Once done, you will be able to see polyfill material when you look down into your cartomizer now.

, Proceed to add 20-25 drops of E-Liquid down into the Cartomizer. Keep count as you do this to avoid overfilling.

, This will allow the liquid inside to saturate the filling and prime it for vaping. It will help you to avoid burning out your tip. The tip must be wet enough, so let it saturate for the full amount of time.

, You could choose to put the one with the hole you removed back in. Another option would be a “drip tip,” which would take the place of plugs.

, Rotate the cartomizer onto the threading of your electronic smoking device or vaporizer. Tighten the pieces together.

, Put the cartomizer between your lips. Hold down the button or switch for a moment. Proceed to vape as desired.You don't have to inhale as forcefully with a cartomizer as you would with a traditional cigarette., When your juice runs low, you will need to refill. Keep in mind that when your tips need more E-Liquid after the initial fill, each cartomizer can be refilled with an estimated 10-15 drops as needed.

, Most will only last 1-2 weeks, so purchasing a cartomizer will be a constant expense. With your new cartomizer, follow the instructions for filling, and enjoy!

Obtain an atomizer.,
Clean the atomizer of primer.,
Attach the atomizer to the battery.,
Attach the drip tip to the atomizer.,
Choose a liquid.,
Drip the liquid on the atomizer.To add the liquid, hold the e-cigarette in a vertical position with the battery assembly on the bottom and drop a few drops down through the hole at the top of the drip tip.,
Puff the e-cigarette.,
Select your wick.,
Choose an atomizer coil.,
Wrap your wire around the wick.,
Tinker with your atomizer.",How to Use an Atomizer," Atomizers are readily available at vape shops, mall kiosks, and online. You could choose a low-resistance atomizer to get a hotter atomizer coil. This will result in more rapid evaporation of the liquid and a larger vapor cloud.Low-resistance atomizers are labeled on their packaging, as well as on the atomizer itself with the letters “LR,” usually around the threaded edge.


Rebuildable atomizers offer the opportunity to swap out coil types, resistance wires, and wicking materials. These are for the hardcore vape enthusiast.;
, When your atomizer is new, you should blow out the primer from the atomizer. Primer, or primer fluid, protects the atomizer from oxidation between the time of its manufacture and purchase.Blow the primer out of the atomizer from the top (the open end) toward the bottom, where the threading is. Blow it out over a napkin or paper towel.


Do not inhale the first 20 to 50 puffs from the atomizer. They will have an unpleasant taste due to primer residue. Instead, let them evaporate out of the top of the atomizer and float off into the wind.
You should also rinse the atomizer in alcohol (rubbing alcohol, rum, or vodka) or denture cleaner. Blow (or shake) the liquid out of the atomizer and let it dry.

, The atomizer is an important component in both two-piece and three-piece e-cigarattes, and consists of a heating coil to heat the e-cigarette liquid until it becomes smoke. The battery connects to the atomizer, and the two are mediated by a circuit board.Check both ends of the atomizer for a threaded area; this is the end that will easily screw onto the battery.

, The drip tip is a short attachment through which you drip e-cigarette liquid onto the atomizer. The drip eliminates the need to take off a cap from the top of the atomizer each time you want to add liquid. While one end of the atomizer is attached to the battery, the other end should be attached to a drip tip. The drip tip simply snaps into the open, non-threaded end of the atomizer.


There are many kinds of drip tips. They can be of plastic, resin, or metal.
Make sure that the drip tip is the right size for your atomizer in advance. Most atomizers and drip tips are of the standard 510 variety. If you are unsure, ask the advice of a vape shop associate.

, There are many varieties of e-cigarette liquid. For a healthier choice, use a nicotine-free e-cigarette liquid. Choose a liquid flavor that you like. You could select:cherry
mojito
green tea
coffee
mint
candy
green apple

, Let the liquid sit in the atomizer coil for a few seconds so that the liquid is more fully absorbed.


Be careful when adding the e-cigarette liquid. If you get it on your hands or skin, you might absorb potentially toxic levels of nicotine. Wear disposable gloves so as to avoid getting any on you accidentally., Put the drip tip in your mouth, angled slightly down. Press the button on the battery end of the e-cigarette and inhale. The liquid absorbed into the wick and atomizer coil should evaporate into smoke.


Vaping is not allowed in many public places, workplaces, bars, and restaurants. It is also banned on airplanes and most public transit systems. Check your local and state laws to ensure you know where you can and cannot use your atomizer.
Use your atomizer at home or at a friend’s house for an enjoyable and relaxing experience.

, Selecting the wick is the first step in modifying your rebuildable atomizer. Rebuildable atomizers are customizable, and perfect for die-hard Vapers who wants total control over their vaping experience. Genesis, or top-fed, atomizers usually use stainless steel mesh rolled into a tube and torched for a wick. Other atomizers that are either bottom-fed or dripper style use silica or ekowool.Steel mesh wicks must be between 300 and 500 threads per square inch.Ecowool more readily absorbs e-cigarette liquid than silica, but is also more expensive.If you want a more natural material in your wick, you could utilize cotton or hemp.

, The atomizer coil is the part of the atomizer that heats the wick. There are two types of coils: single coils and dual coils. Single coils have only one heating element, while dual coils have two.The type you choose depends on your personal preferences. Compared to double coils, single coils use less battery power and are easier to work with when rebuilding, but their vapor density is lower.


E-cigarette liquids that are high in acidity (such as fruity flavors) will wear your coil out faster than liquids that are lower in acidity.
The voltage you run through your coil will also affects its lifespan. Running a lot of power through the coil will cause it to burn out more quickly.
Finally, the more you use your vaporizer, the faster the coil will wear out. Heavy users might wear a coil out in a week; for less frequent users, the coil might last three weeks.
You will know when you need to change your coil because the atomizer will not vaporize the liquid properly, or at all.

, The amount of wire you use will determine its resistance. Resistance measures how easy it is to pass electricity through a conductor, and is measure in ohms. The more wire you wrap around the wick, the higher the resistance will be. A higher resistance will cause the atomizer’s power to go down and save battery life; a lower resistance will lead the power to go up and rapidly deplete your battery’s life.


If you want less vapor from your atomizer, use a higher resistance. Do the opposite for more vapor.After wrapping the wire around your wick in tight spirals,
Wire gauge is usually between 28 and 32.Torch the wire (usually Kanthal wire) before adding it to your atomizer. This will burn off any manufacturing residue that you might otherwise inhale when you heat the wire in the atomizer.
Avoid sub-ohm atomizers. In other words, do not build atomizers with a resistance of less than one. This runs the risk of electrical instability and could cause the atomizer to explode., By combining various elements in different arrangements, you can control how much evaporation your atomizer produces.Part of the fun in using an atomizer to vape is the ability to swap different builds with others in the vape community and figure out how to get the smoothest smoking experience possible. Modify your rebuildable atomizer until you’re happy with it.


Ensure the battery is not attached to your atomizer while rebuilding.

Weigh the benefits of smoking marijuana.,
Don’t forget the drawbacks of smoking.,
Give vaping a try.,
Eat your medical marijuana.,
Raise a glass to marijuana beverages.,
Do your homework before you “dab” marijuana concentrate or chew on fresh cannabis.",How to Take Medical Marijuana1," Recreational users typically smoke marijuana for a reason, and it’s not the pungent odor. Inhaling super-heated marijuana particles is one of the fasted delivery methods for the compounds within. The physical (and psychological) effects can happen quickly, even within minutes, meaning that a patient in pain may find faster relief this way.Smoking is also a very user-friendly method, especially for those used to smoking tobacco or recreational marijuana. Depending upon the availability of marijuana where you live, you may also have a near-endless variety of strains and strengths available to you at reasonable prices.;
, Yes, smoking marijuana — whether in a joint, a pipe, or a bong — delivers the desired chemical compounds to your body quickly. However, the effects also tend to wear off quickly, often on the shorter end of one-and-a-half to four hours.Smoking marijuana also creates the telltale odor that tends to linger on clothing, hair, furniture, and just about everything else within range.
Most importantly, while the comparative damage vis-as-vis smoking tobacco products is not entirely clear, it is obvious that inhaling smoke is detrimental to your lungs. So, unless you already have a terminal illness, you may want to consider alternate methods.

, Vaping — inhaling dried cannabis that has been placed in a vaporizer — offers the quick-release benefits of smoking without the same risk for lung damage or overwhelming odors. Vaping may also be a more manageable inhalation method for patients with breathing problems.On the negative side, vaping shares the same limited effectiveness period as traditional smoking. Also, unlike rolling a joint or filling a pipe, you have to make sure the battery on your vaporizer is charged (unless it’s a plug-in model) and wait for it to heat up. And, marijuana vaporizers tend to be fairly expensive, even without factoring in the cost of the marijuana that goes inside.

, Far beyond the humble homemade “pot brownie,” there is actually an extensive range of packaged foods (from popcorn to lollipops and beyond) laced with measured doses of medical cannabis. Depending upon where you live and the medical marijuana laws there, you may find these products at your chosen dispensary.While pre-packaged foods may be convenient, you can certainly still whip up your own marijuana-laced foods, which gives you total control over the contents. A simple internet search will unearth a bevy of recipes.
Using food eliminates the odor and reduces the possible stigma a patient may experience from using marijuana; the effects tend to linger for longer than when smoking or vaping as well.
That said, the medicinal impact may take an hour or more to kick in, so food may not be the best choice for surges of pain that need quick relief. Also, some patients may have conditions that cause nausea or a loss of appetite, making food an unattractive choice.

, If your local dispensary has marijuana foods, it will also probably have a range of drinks like smoothies, juices, sodas, teas, and so on. As with foods, using marijuana-laced drinks can reduce the potential stigma and replace the pungent odor of smoke with a flavorful beverage with lasting medical effects.Cannabis teas are a popular make-at-home option; they can be brewed from buds, leaves, prepackaged bags, tinctures, and so on, and other teas can be mixed in for flavor.
You get the same trade-off with both foods and drinks — it takes longer for the effects to occur, but they usually last longer than with smoking.
Take special precautions with marijuana-laced food and drink if you have children around. What they think is just a regular cookie or soda could have significant and harmful health consequences.

, “Dabbing” involves heating a concentrated packet of marijuana to a high temperature (often with a butane torch) and inhaling the smoke. The effect is immediate and powerful; the potential for overdose is significant. Also, playing around with torches and superheated packets of cannabis may not be your idea of an easy or convenient medication experience.On the other end of the spectrum, some users swear by the medical benefits of consuming fresh cannabis leaves and buds — whether by juicing them or simply chomping on them raw. This method, however, requires access to large amounts of fresh (and hopefully legal) cannabis, and many people find the flavor off-putting. Also, there is scant evidence (beyond anecdotal support) on the effectiveness of this method.

However, dipping can cause cancers of the mouth, throat, and esophagus, as well as shrinking of the gums around your teeth, cracked lips, white spots, sores, bleeding in the mouth, tooth loss, bad breath, and increased risk for heart disease and stroke.;
, Make the decision to quit about you, not about someone else in your life. If you quit for someone else when you don't want to, you may resent them during the withdrawal process.


That being said, family members and friends can be a great support and inspiration for quitting dipping. Accept support from your loved ones.
Dipping can greatly impact not only your life but the lives of your family and friends.

, Realize that you are spending money to harm yourself. If you are chewing as often as one can per day, your addiction can get expensive very quickly. Try to view your addiction as an intense waste of money if that helps you recognize that you have a problem.


Your health insurance costs will also go up as a result of your chewing habit.
If you do contract a disease or cancer as a result of dipping, the cost of treatment will be enormous.

, You may not be able to remember when you chose to start dipping. In fact, it may not have been a conscious decision at all. Chances are, you did not plan to become a dipper, but somehow it happened and now you need to fix it.


Maybe your friends and/or family introduced you to dipping one day and you gradually accepted, eventually becoming comfortable with the substance and ultimately becoming addicted.
Maybe a certain behavior triggers a tobacco craving, such as playing in a baseball league with other dippers. Identify and avoid trigger behaviors and settings.

, Evaluate the facts of your situation, not how you feel about them. Your feelings are important, but they sometimes lead you to a false sense of reality.


When your mind tries to tell you that you cannot withhold a dip any longer, recognize that the truth is you will not die if you withhold a dip.
When your mind starts to make excuses, try to bring yourself back to the reality of the situation., Your primary choice consists of your long-term goal, which is that you are going to quit dipping. Your continuous choice is an immediate choice that you can revisit each day, such as ""I am not going to dip right now."""

Ask about a sedative for panic attacks.,
Sleep it off.,
Ask someone to be with you.",How to Sober Up from Weed1," A typical high will wear off in about three hours, with the main effects spiking about 30 minutes after you smoked. However, when you eat cannabis or take too much, the effect can take longer to wear off. Highs can last as long as six hours or more. They can also be unpredictable if the cannabis has other drugs mixed in. If you took an exceptionally high dose of cannabis, your high can last much longer.Taking too much can happen in cases where you are eating cannabis, and subsequently eat too much because it doesn't take effect as quickly as you thought it would.In fact, the drug can stay in your body for up to two days.;
, Some people want to come off their high because they unexpectedly became paranoid or had a panic attack. You can't hurry up your high, but you may be able to take a sedative in the benzodiazepine class if you have a prescription for them (and only if you have a prescription for them).Always talk to your doctor before mixing prescription drugs with recreational drugs. Your doctor can say if they're safe for you.

, Because highs can last so long, one of the best things you can do is sleep it off. Of course, if you're having a panic attack, that can be difficult, but that's where the sedative can be helpful., You need to keep yourself from being injured when your high, and having someone around can help.In addition, if you start to panic, having someone to talk to can make the situation easier.

Exhale smoke into the sploof.,
Extinguish your cigarette, pipe, or joint.,
Clean your ash tray.,
Dispose of the evidence.,
Wash away any lingering smoke or odors.",How to Smoke Without Getting Caught," To prevent any smoke from seeping under the door, you should roll up a towel and lay it out in front of the gap at the bottom of the door.Make sure that the towel extends from end to end of the door and that it is pressed close against the gap.;
, Taking a shower is a good excuse for spending lots of time in the bathroom and the steam will also blend with the smoke and help to cover up the odor.The sound of the shower will also help to mask the sounds of a lighter striking or of you puffing and exhaling smoke.


You may also want to play some music on your phone to provide an extra layer of sound protection.
Make sure that you actually take a shower (or at least get your hair wet so it looks like you took a shower) or people will be suspicious.

, As you smoke, make sure that you direct your smoke towards an open window or towards a vent. You may want to check out the window first to be sure nobody is outside who might see the smoke escaping from the window.

, If you have time to actually take a shower, then make sure that you shampoo your hair. The aromatic qualities of the shampoo will quickly fill the room, making any smoke odors difficult to detect.You can also pour a bit of shampoo into the sink and fill it up with hot water if you don’t have time to wash your hair.

, After you are done smoking, empty your pipe or toss the remains of your cigarette into the toilet and flush them. Do one last check of the bathroom to be sure that there are no ashes on the floor or anything else that might signal to someone that you were smoking in the bathroom.

, Try to get an air freshener that has a strong scent and that also neutralizes odors. Spray lots of air freshener before you exit the bathroom.If you do not have any air freshener on hand, then body spray, cologne, or perfume can also work to cover up the smell. Spray it on yourself and around the bathroom as well.

, Hair is quite porous and it tends to hold onto smells more than your skin does. Tie back long hair and cover it with a bandanna or towel to prevent the smoke from getting to your hair.


If you have a plastic shower cap, then this is ideal because the plastic will protect your hair and it will not pick up any of the smoke’s smell either.

, The more clothing that you have on, the more likely you will be to collect smoke smell on your clothes. Consider taking off your shirt when you smoke or at least roll up your sleeves.


You might also consider wearing a designated smoking jacket (or sweatshirt) when you smoke. You can keep it hidden in your room somewhere and wear it when you need to smoke. Make sure that you wash it at least once per week to keep it from smelling too much.

, You will need to have something to cover up the smell of the smoke, so try lighting a couple of sticks of incense or a scented candle. If you don’t have any of these things, then you can also spray some air freshener around your room before and after you start smoking.

, To prevent smoke from escaping to other parts of your house, place a damp towel along the crack beneath your bedroom door.The damp towel will not only block the smoke from getting out of your room and absorb some of the odor as well.

, You want to try to direct as much smoke as possible out of your room. If smoke can't exit through an open window or duct, the smoke will leave its odor on walls, carpets, furniture and linens.


If you happen to have a fireplace duct in your room, then that is even better. Fireplaces are specifically designed to allow smoke to escape a building, so it will be easier to direct smoke out of your room if your room has a fireplace duct., Turn on a fan to push the smoke toward the window and to help disperse it after it forms. A tabletop fan pointed toward an open window or air duct is ideal.


If you are smoking in a bathroom with a ventilator or exhaust fan, turn it on and aim the smoke toward it to quickly eliminate visible smoke and odors. The special ventilators work by sucking up excess moisture and air particles.

, Even though you may have kept the smoke from filling your room, you will most likely have some lingering smoke smell on you. Do what you can to cover up the smell of the smoke.


For example, you can apply some aftershave on your fingertips, peel and eat an orange, or use a strong scented body spray on yourself.

, You can blow your smoke into the dryer sheet-stuffed tube and it will pass through smelling like the dryer sheets.


You can also use an empty 20-ounce soda bottle with the bottom removed.These work great since the bottle is already made to fit in your mouth.

, Ensure that they're evenly spread between each opening so that the smoke will have to pass through the dryer sheets. If you are making a sploof from a soda bottle, use six or seven dryer sheets.

, After you take a drag on your cigarette or pipe, place one end of the toilet paper roll over your mouth and exhale into the tube. Make sure that you blow all of smoke into the tube. When the smoke comes out on the other side, it will smell dryer fresh.


If you can't make a sploof, simply blow your smoke into a damp towel, t-shirt or other fabric. The moist material will absorb the smoke and its odor. Be sure you use fabric that's not frequently used and launder it immediately after you smoke.

, If you are done smoking but your cigarette, pipe or joint is still lit, then you will want to put it out right away. The best way to put out a lit cigarette is by stubbing it in an ashtray or by dousing it in water.


To put out a pipe, you can just stop puffing and it should go out on its own after a minute or two. You can also cover the bowl with your hand (as long as it is not too hot) and the lack of oxygen should put it out. If the bowl is hot, then use a few drops of water.
To put out a joint, you can stub it in an ashtray or use a bit of water to put out the ember at the end. Just be careful not to get the whole thing wet or you won’t be able to smoke the rest of the joint.

, If you used a small plate, cup, or jar as a makeshift ashtray, be sure to clean it well with hot water and a bit of soap until the ash is gone.


If you used an empty can or some other disposable item, then you can just throw it away. Just make sure that it is covered up in the trash can. You may also want to clean it out first to prevent any odors from coming from it.

, The easiest way to dispose of ashes or butts is to flush them down a toilet. Cover the cigarette in toilet paper to reduce the chance of ash and other debris floating back up.If you're nervous about flushing your evidence down the toilet, you can also seal the ashes and/or butts in a plastic bag and toss the evidence into a public trash can when you are out.

, Even when you are done smoking, its smell can remain on hands, breath and clothing. Washing your hands, brushing your teeth, showering and changing your clothes will help to eliminate any lasting scents.



Wash your hands. Wash your hands with lots of soap after you finish smoking. Washing with hot water alone won't be enough to rub off the smell. If you don’t have access to a bathroom right away, then use some alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

Brush your teeth. Your teeth and breath will also hold a lingering odor after you've smoked. Be sure to brush your teeth for at least two minutes, with special attention given to the tongue and gums. You can also spruce up your breath by using mouth wash or eating a mint-flavored candy or gum.

Take a shower. Smoke will linger on any body part it touches, so showering is the most important part of your post-smoking routine. Use plenty of soap, shampoo and shower gel, paying special attention to your hair, which most often retains the smell of smoke.

Change your clothes. Once you're out of the shower, you'll want to put on a fresh pair of clothes. No matter how diligently you directed smoke outdoors, some of the odor will still linger on your clothes. Be sure you are the person who launders the discarded clothes to avoid being caught.

Use patches on your skin.,
Try topical marijuana medications.,
See if sub-lingual sprays work for you.,
Consider cannabis suppositories.",How to Take Medical Marijuana2," Transdermal patches offer a discreet, low-effort delivery method for medical marijuana. If you suffer from nausea or loss of appetite, or otherwise can’t or don’t want to inhale or consume cannabis, patches may be your best bet for relief.Follow the package instructions and your doctor’s guidance on proper use. Typically, transdermal patches are placed on a hairless area of skin, such as the inner wrist, ankle, or on top of the foot.
Dosages vary, and patches can be cut in half to reduce dosages. People seeking low-dose relief may find patches particularly appealing.
However, if you have substantial body hair, patches may not be for you. Some people also develop allergic reactions at the application point.

, Medical marijuana comes in various topical application forms, including sprays, salves, lotions, and ointments. Skin application of cannabis causes no psychoactive effects (which may be a positive or negative, depending upon your circumstances), and is best suited to skin conditions, arthritis, soreness, etc.


Topical applications, however, are very “hit-or-miss.” Some patients swear by them, while others say they do nothing. They won’t be effective for pain caused by cancer, glaucoma, or other conditions for which medical marijuana in other forms is often used.
Also, the products tend to be greasy upon application and may cause skin irritation in some patients.

, Tinctures of medical cannabis and alcohol (or another solution) can be sprayed under the tongue for relatively fast effect (faster than eating, slower than inhaling). The sprays come in small, discreet bottles, produce no odor and have a mild taste, are usually low-dose, and may be a good choice for children.Instead of a spray, some tinctures use a dropper. Just one or two drops under the tongue is usually sufficient.
If you need immediate relief, sprays may not be for you. Likewise, if you need a stronger dose, they can quickly become very expensive.

, The mere mention of inserting any type of medication into the rectum may be enough to turn off some patients. There is also some debate as to the relative effectiveness of cannabis extract suppositories. However, they also seem to offer fast, long-lasting relief to many patients.Most suppositories require you to lie on your side and (with a gloved hand) insert the capsule about 1.5 inches (4 cm) into your rectum, then stay in place for a few minutes while the medication absorbs into your colon.
While suppositories seem to be one of the most efficient, fast-acting, and long-lasting delivery methods, the process involved in application (and the need to refrigerate the capsules) may outweigh these potential benefits for many patients.

Work with your prescribing physician.,
Start low and slow.,
Keep your own and others’ safety in mind.,
Switch things up.,
Keep a medication log.,
Know the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction.",How to Take Medical Marijuana3," If you’re legally using marijuana for a legitimate medical purpose, you’re going to have to be in contact with a prescribing physician. Take the opportunity to ask the doctor for recommendations and guidance regarding the delivery methods and concentrations that may be most effective for your particular condition.


In the U.S., state laws vary widely on which doctors can prescribe (and which patients can receive) medical marijuana. Make sure your doctor is authorized to prescribe and experienced in the process.If one form of medical marijuana isn’t working for you, talk to your doctor about making a switch. Also, if you’re experiencing unusual or significant side effects, share these with your doctor.

, As with most other medications, the goal with marijuana is to find the lowest effective dose for your condition. By taking as little cannabis as necessary to address your needs, you’ll reduce the impact of side effects or interactions, and also likely save money.


For instance, if you’re starting out with packaged medical marijuana cookies, start by eating one-fourth of a cookie. Wait an hour or so and consider its effects on your pain, as well as any side effects. If necessary, move up to a half-cookie next time, and repeat the process.
Especially when you’re in ongoing pain, it’s tempting to go for a big dose and (hopefully) big relief. However, work with your prescribing physician to methodically work your way up to the dose that works best for your particular needs.

, Especially when you’re starting out with medical marijuana, or changing doses or delivery methods, take extra precautions for your own well-being and the safety of others. The psychoactive effects of cannabis compounds can make activities like driving, operating machinery or appliances, or even navigating a cluttered house risky propositions.


Start your new or altered regimen at a time and place where you can safely wait to gauge the impacts. And follow your doctor’s recommendations and your own (pre-medicated) common sense when it comes to engaging in activities like driving after using medical marijuana.

, While you won’t technically develop a tolerance to cannabis, your body can become accustomed to it to the point that its medical effectiveness wanes. In such a scenario, a brief “medicine vacation” or a switch to another variety, dosage, or delivery method may help restore the benefits.As with any medication, don’t stop using cannabis, change dosages, or alter delivery methods without the advice and consent of your prescribing physician.

, Instead of relying on vague recollections and fleeting notions of your medication regimen, keep an accurate, up-to-date, detailed log of your cannabis usage. This will empower you (and your doctor) to make informed decisions in regards to tailoring your dosages and delivery methods. As such, it will be easier to maximize medication impact and minimize undesirable effects.


When it comes to medication logs of any type, there is no such thing as “too detailed.” For a cannabis log, keep track of details like the date and time of use; amount used; strain, type, and cannabinoid content (if known to you); therapeutic and side effects; your feelings before and after; and so on (perhaps employing a dozen or more categories).It is especially important to keep a detailed log during the first week or two of using a new or changed medication; but an ongoing log is even better. With medical marijuana or any other medication, information is power.

, Marijuana laws, both medical and recreational, are changing quickly in the 50 U.S. states and around the world. Take it upon yourself to know your rights and responsibilities when it comes to medical marijuana usage where you live. If need be, assert the rights you do possess or advocate for changes to benefit yourself and others who rely upon medical cannabis.


Study the current laws and regulations where you live by checking the website of or contacting your health department (or other supervisory government entity). Keep in regular contact with your prescribing physician as well.Consider joining an advocacy group and/or contacting your legislators if you believe changes need to be made to the laws where you live. Don’t assume you’ll be joining forces with just a bunch of “pot-heads” — there are people of all ages and backgrounds, from children to gray-haired grandmas, who benefit from using medical marijuana.

Getting through the initial stage.,
Expect mental struggles during days 4 through 20.,
Watch your symptoms ease by the month and a half mark.,
Prepare for possible anxiety attacks up until month two and a half.,
Experience disillusionment at month three.,
Celebrate the 100 day mark.",How to Stop Dipping2," The first three days after you decide to quit will be extremely hard on your physical body. Your body takes 72 hours to pass nicotine out of your system.

Drink lots of water during this stage.






Channel your anger into some activity, whether it is working out, journaling your experience, or making art.







, While the worst of the physical ailments will be over by this point because the nicotine has passed through your system, you will begin to have to develop mental will-power. Your body has to figure out how to operate without nicotine.


During this stage, you may encounter cravings, irritability, insomnia, fatigue, inability to focus, headache, sore throat, tongue, and/or gums, constipation, gas, stomach pain, and dry mouth.
Focus on your mental stamina and health during the second stage.
Avoid triggers. Triggers are certain behaviors that bring up the desire to dip. These may be places where you usually dip, people you usually dip with, or activities you usually complete with a dip in.

, By day 50 or so, you should be experiencing less symptoms and be slowly transitioning to a normal routine. Sores may form in your mouth, but don't be alarmed, this is your mouth healing small ulcers that may have developed from dipping.


Visit your dentist if the sores become painful, discolored, or seem to be infected.
You should be sleeping better by this stage. If you are not, think about visiting a doctor who can evaluate your body's progress.

, During this stage, some people suffer from anxiety attacks as a result of the inability to use tobacco to calm themselves down.


If your anxiety attacks are really bad and physically alarming, contact your doctor. S/he may prescribe an anxiety medication or an anti-depressant of some sort.
Think about talking with a therapist or joining a community of ex-dippers to quell stress by talking about your anxieties.

, Expect to feel sluggish, unclear, and experience scattered cravings at this stage. Some people experience just a few days of feeling like they just started the process, but stay strong.

, By this time, you should be pretty much past the physical side-effects. You may still experience cravings every once in a while, but stick to your guns and be strong. "

Satisfy the need for oral fixation.,
Choose a different type of nicotine replacement therapy.,
Take prescription drugs.,
Drink a lot of water.,
Exercise.,
Establish a relaxation technique.",How to Stop Dipping3," A huge part of the attractiveness of dipping is the oral stimulation that it provides. There are several different types of fake chew on the market that can simulate the experience without damaging your health.


Purchase an herbal-based chew such as Jake's Mint Chew or BACCOFF Non Tobacco Chew. Fake chews usually come in several different flavors, including a flavor that simulates the taste and feel of real chewing tobacco.
Chew nicotine gum or regular gum. Some people will only need to simulate the feeling of constantly chewing on something to get their oral fixation. Purchase your favorite chewing gum or nicotine gum and pop a piece in your mouth when a craving arises.
Use sunflower seeds. Sunflower seeds are often eaten during baseball games as an alternative to chewing tobacco. They give you something to chew on and spit out, simulating the feeling of dipping.Begin using these products the day you stop dipping.

, There are several different nicotine replacements on the market that allow your body to get a necessary amount of nicotine without ingesting the other harmful chemicals in tobacco. These can help ease withdrawal symptoms.


Nicotine gum, patches, and lozenges are available over the counter. Gum and lozenges may be the most effective for dippers because they most resemble the action of dipping.
Nicotine nasal spray and nasal inhalers require a prescription from a doctor, and may be less effective for smokeless tobacco users.
If you use more than three cans or pouches per week, you are considered a heavy user and require high doses of nicotine replacement therapy. Those who use two to three cans should try moderate doses, and those who use less than two should use low doses.

, Some drugs are available with a prescription from your doctor that can help with the symptoms of withdrawal. Some can be started a week or so before you begin to quit and can sometimes be used in conjunction with other types of nicotine replacement therapy.


Varenicline (Chantix®) manipulates the nicotine receptors in your brain and helps ease the symptoms of withdrawal. It can be taken in pill form twice daily and should be started a week before you plan to quit. Studies have shown that Varenicline can help to increase long-term quitting success. Some mild side effects such as nausea, dizziness, and vomiting may occur.
Bupropion (Zyban® or Wellbutrin® or Aplenzin®) is an anti-depressant that may help smokeless tobacco users, but the evidence is unclear. It does not contain nicotine and comes in an extended-release pill form.Consult your doctor about whether a prescription drug is right for you.

, Keep your body hydrated and try to stay healthy in other areas of your life such as your eating habits.

, Physical activity can distract you from cravings immediately. Just 30 minutes of exercise per day can quell a tobacco craving., Perform any tasks or activities that help you relax. This could be a hobby such as crafting, working on cars, or gardening, as well as some sort of visualization practice.


Try deep-breathing exercises and visualization techniques to calm an anxious mind. If a yoga practice interests you, try visiting a nearby studio or practice a yoga video in your home.
Hypnosis has also been successful in helping some people quit using tobacco."

Join a tobacco cessation program or obtain a quitting partner.,
Write down your thoughts and feelings.,
Obtain the goal of freedom.,
Stay in the present moment.,
Help someone else quit.",How to Stop Dipping4," Choose a group of people or a person that shares your desire to quit dipping or has already gone through the process. Doing so will give you someone to be accountable to and allows you to hold someone else responsible as well. Here's what to look for in a program:


Offers one-on-one or group counseling.
Counseling sessions last at least 15 to 30 minutes.
Your program meets for a least four sessions during a two-week period.
The group leader should be educated in tobacco cessation.
The longer and more intense the program, the higher the chance you will have of succeeding., Keeping a journal is a great way to record your quitting process and remind yourself why you chose to quit in the first place.


You will have good days and bad days, and the entries that you wrote on the good days will help you through the tougher ones when you revisit those feelings of accomplishment.
Journaling can also be a cathartic process that allows you to release your emotions in a healthy, focused way.

, Look at your addiction as something that is holding you back not just from being your best self, but also holding you back from living a free life. Sure, you chose to take that initial dip, but then you became addicted to the tobacco. Consciously remind yourself that you no longer want tobacco to rule your life.

, Refrain from looking to the past and dwelling on what you should have or could have done sooner, but also try not to look to the future too much. While you do want to retain hope that you can kick the habit and be a healthier person, try to stay grounded in the present moment.


Take your addiction treatment one day at a time. You are going to suffer throughout the entire process even after you've reached the 100 day benchmark. Try to retain perspective and take it day by day.
Don't dwell on a particularly bad day. You may experience periods of depression alongside days when you feel great. Don't beat yourself up if you experience a setback.

, Once you've reached a stable point in your quitting process (around the 100 day mark) directly mentor someone in your existing group, or join a group to start mentoring someone.


Giving back to others who need help will gratify you immensely and help you feel a sense of achievement.
Mentoring someone also keeps you accountable to another person. When you have someone relying on you and looking to you for support, you will feel a duty to stay honest to yourself and your partner.

It has to come from you.However, take it step-by-step. Maybe the first commitment you make to yourself is finding a rehab program. Maybe the second commitment you make is going to the rehab program. Choose steps you can take day-by-day., Contrary to popular belief, you can get addicted to marijuana. The high you get from marijuana is what causes some people to get addicted—they want to recreate that feeling. For everyday users, about a quarter to a half become addicted to the drug., It's not easy to quit any kind of drug on your own. Addiction is a chronic condition for many people and it requires a number of services that hug the patient and provide them with the support that they need. Find a program out there that can help you. If you need a break from your life, try a rehab program, which can separate you from a lifestyle that contributes to your smoking habit for awhile. If you have good support from your family, try a local group like Marijuana Anonymous.The government provides resources for helping you get off drugs. For instance, you can use the government website SAMHSA to find a rehab center that's right for you. SAMHSA is the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.Look into addiction counseling, peer support groups, pharmacotherapy, and psychotherapy. Some or all of these services may be needed to get you into recovery.

, Using a drug like marijuana is often a way to escape problems. Therefore, to help you get off the drug, you need to learn how to deal with stress without reaching for the drug. Rehabs and groups for addicts can be helpful, but you can also learn some coping mechanisms on your own.One way to help you cope with stress is to talk about it with people you trust. Even if you can't come up with a solution, sometimes just getting the stress off your chest by talking can help relieve it.Don't be afraid to take a break from a stressful situation. If something is really stressing you out, such as a work problem, don't be afraid to walk away from it for a bit. Take a moment to take a few deep breaths and clear your head. In addition, don't be afraid to take a break from things that stress you out in your life. For instance, if you find watching the news stressful, maybe you should skip it for awhile., If you've been smoking weed for a long time, you will likely experience some side effects when you stop. Some people have trouble sleeping after stopping weed, while others may experience depression or excessive anger. Another withdrawal effect is your dreams may become more vivid, as using weed can make your dreams less vivid., You'll also likely experience some physical side effects of withdrawal. You may develop headaches for awhile or experience night sweats. You also may cough up mucus. Finally, you may have a lowered appetite, as well as have shaking or dizziness., If all of your friends also smoke, you're likely to fall back into old habits if you continue to hang out with them. Try making some new friends with whom you can enjoy other activities. For instance, you could join local groups that have an interest in the same hobbies as you. You could volunteer or join an exercise class. Find people who like some of the same things you do, minus the weed.Try looking on meetup.com for groups in your area.

, Drinking plenty of water may help flush some of the marijuana out of your system. In addition, being hydrated can make you feel better over all.Though the typical recommendation is to drink eight glasses of water a day, experts actually suggest that men need about thirteen cups of water a day, while women need about nine.Try drinking some cranberry juice in addition to water. It can help in the process of detoxing., If you are having problems with extra sweating, eat foods high in potassium. Try potatoes with the skin on, melons, bananas, citrus fruits, and dark, leafy greens., Because detoxing can cause insomnia, you don't want to add to the problem. While you're trying to get your sleep schedule back to normal, skip the coffee., Exercising can give you a natural high to help put you in a good mood. In addition, it keeps you healthy, helping you to heal faster. Try exercising several times a week to help mitigate your depression and sleeplessness."

Stay cool and calm.",How to Smoke in Your House without People Knowing," Before you start smoking, it's very important you give the smoke an exit to escape. Without an open window or duct, the smoke will linger in the room and your health will be at risk.Depending on the room you're going to smoke in, there should almost always be some window to open.


A fireplace duct is an even better choice, as fireplaces are specifically designed to let smoke escape.It's not recommended that you try to smoke if the room you're planning on doesn't some kind of access to the outside.;
, Next, you'll want to make sure the smoke doesn't get a chance to escape to other parts of the house or building you're smoking in. The best way to do this is by placing a towel (preferably wet) along the bottom of the door. This way, the towel will block off the most obvious place for smoke to get out.


Making the towel wet does add extra protection against smoke, but it might not be a great idea if you're worried about being caught after the fact. Someone else might notice the wet patch on your doorstep and start asking questions.

, Turning on a fan will disperse the smoke shortly after it forms. The particulars will vary depending on the type of room you're smoking in, but a tabletop fan will work well enough, provided you have it pointed at an open window or duct.


Some bathrooms come equipped with special ventilators that clean the air by sucking up excess moisture and particles. If your bathroom has this or something similar to it, turning it on and aiming the smoke towards it could be a quick way to eliminate the smell and visible smoke both at once.

, Although you'll ultimately want to eliminate the smoke smell for good, another great way of dealing with it when other people are in the house is through masking the scent with another, more powerful one. There are a lot of potential options in this regard; the trick lies in figuring out which one best suits your situation.


The most common method of masking scent is through using an air freshener. These 'room perfumes' will spread a mild, unintrusive smell designed to mute other odours in the air. Air fresheners are very affordable and easy to find. If you don't already own one, go to your nearest store and purchase one. Once you have it, make sure to spray all around the room, making sure to give attention to the ceiling, corners, and other places the smoke might linger.
If you're in a bathroom, one effective trick is to put a bit of shampoo in the sink and mix it with some hot water. The shampoo's aromatic qualities will quickly fill the room, making the subsequent smoke that much harder to detect.
Incense is another good choice, and one of the most effective when it comes to masking unwanted smoke. However, keep in mind that incense might raise eyebrows in certain environments, and some people might find the smell just as intrusive as that of a cigarette.

, Not only will the smoke now have somewhere to go, you'll also have less issues with a lingering smell. The most common method of smoking indoors is to stand next to a window, leaning into it, and exhaling the smoke outdoors. The way you go about it will depend on the shape, position and size of the window; anything is fine so long as the smoke is getting outside as fast as possible.


If you have a portable fan, try putting the fan next to the window, aiming outwards. When it comes time to exhale, exhale into the fan from behind it. The fan's blades will subsequently hurl the smoke outside.
If you're by a window and are looking to not get caught, you should keep an eye on your surroundings outside. If someone's outside, it might look suspicious that you're leaning out your window. Exercise alertness and caution.

, Keep your hair out of the way. If your hair is long, it's a good idea to tie it back; that way, your hair won't pick up as much of the odour.


While you're at it, you might want to take off any extra layers of clothing you might have. Anything you're wearing is going to pick up some of the smell, so it's a good idea to minimize what you're wearing before you smoke.

, At last, you can enjoy your smoke! Be ware, however, for anyone that might come in or see you while you're smoking. Any amount of time you have the smoke in your hands increases the risk of being caught, so try to keep the experience short and sweet.


Make sure to have somewhere you can quickly discard your cigarette in case someone enters the room. If you're fast and fluid enough, you might be able to get rid of it without them knowing you were smoking to begin with.

, This includes keeping both ears alert for sounds in other rooms, or footsteps that sound like they're heading to your room. If it's really important you're not caught, staying alert and on-edge may give you a few seconds extra notice, and those seconds could mean the difference between getting caught and getting away with it.

, That way, the freshener will be the most recent smell in the room, and others will have a harder time picking up the unwanted scent.

, Hold the cigarette in your hand and gently douse it underneath a faucet. Make sure to keep the cigarette in your hand; if much of the ash falls down the drain, it could lead to clogging.

, The definition of an 'ashtray' will depend on where you were discarding the ash while smoking. Often, a small plate or cup will work as well as a real ashtray. Scrub with water and a bit of soap until the ash is gone.


If you were smoking out a window, it's likely you were dropping the ash out the window. This is a good idea in most cases, so long as you make sure not to let the ash hit the side of the building. If you do, the black trail from your window leading will be a telling sign you've been smoking, and the evidence is very difficult to clean up discreetly.

, The best way to get rid of a cigarette discreetly is to flush it down the toilet.Before you flush it, make sure you've covered the cigarette in some toilet paper; that way, there's less chance of parts of the cigarette floating back up.


If you're really cautious and are worried you'll be caught whilst disposing, you might prefer to seal the cigarette remains in a Ziploc bag. That way, the next time you go out, you can throw it out in a public trashcan.

, Even when the cigarette is gone, you'll still have some things to do to make sure you won't get found out. Washing your hands thoroughly is a good start. Make sure to use a lot of soap. Washing with hot water alone won't be enough to rub off the smell.

, Just like your hands, your teeth will keep a lingering odour after you've smoked. You should make sure to brush your teeth for at least two minutes, with special attention given to the tongue and gums.


If your breath is still bad, eating a spearmint candy or gum will fix any lingering smell issues.

, Showering is the most important part of post-smoke hygiene as smoke will linger on any surface it touches. Use a lot of shampoo and wash your body thoroughly. Pay special attention to your hair, as hair picks up smoke relatively easily. If you usually focus purely on the hair when you shower, make a note of cleaning arms, legs, and other parts that weren't covered by clothing at the time. With the right amount of soap and shampoo, a three minute shower should be all you need to kiss the bad smell goodbye.

, Once you're out of the shower, you'll lastly want to get into new clothes. Even if you were diligent in getting the smoke outside, some of the odour will still find its way onto your clothing. Having a fresh pair of pants and shirt should suffice.


It's recommended you tend to your own laundry yourself if you don't already. Someone else who is cleaning your clothes might still pick up the smell, even days after the fact.

, While smoking indoors isn't stressful by itself, there can be a lot of emotional strain in trying to hide something from someone, particularly if you're close with them. If you're prone to any sort of anxiety or nervousness, you might find the secrecy triggers a bad reaction, especially the next time you're interacting with other people in the house. If you've finished your smoke and feel anxiety or guilt, remind yourself that you're through the worst of it. If you've followed all of the proper steps, other people should have no reason to believe you smoked in the first place!

Know your level of fitness to begin with.,
Look for a fitness boot camp near you.,
Make sure that you go and visit the relevant fitness boot camp before you enroll.,
Check that the fitness boot camp has expert trainers who have recognizable qualifications.,
Ask questions about the nature of the fitness boot camp:

Is it a small or large group environment?,
Find out how the fitness camp records and rewards your fitness achievements.,
Find out how regularly you can attend the fitness boot camp and what sorts of discounts are offered for buying bulk visits.

",How to Find the Best Fitness Boot Camp," Fitness is a diverse concept. In order to be considered as fit, you have to reduce your weight to its normal levels, you have to increase your cardiovascular endurance, you have to increase your strength, and you need to undergo resistance training. However, all of this can be very difficult to do, especially if you don’t know how to proceed. For some people, the ability to hire someone as a personal trainer is an option but for many others, this is an unaffordable solution. If you can't do this, consider the next steps.;
, Look in the Yellow Pages or look on the Internet to find the best fitness boot camps in your area. Then you can easily talk to the people running them and examine the various programs that they offer. Or, another way on how to find the best fitness boot camp can be to ask around to your friends and neighbors on the fitness camps that they may have used.

, You have to be certain that their program and their instructors are compatible with your needs. However, don’t make the mistake of going to a fitness boot camp that doesn’t really force you to attain your best. You will need some gentle pushing and encouragement in order to make sure that you get your level of fitness that you desire. Don’t forget that achieving fitness and weight loss requires patience and diligence for you to be successful and this can be best achieved in a fitness boot camp.

, Ask to see the qualifications to satisfy yourself.

,






Do trainers give one-to-one advice and help as needed?






Are there differing levels of fitness training adjusted to personal needs?






What are the meals? Are special dietary needs catered for (such as diabetes, gluten intolerance, etc.)






What sort of sleep regimes will be in place?







, Your fitness achievements (such as your weight, your cardiovascular endurance, your resistance strength etc) should be continuously measured in order to track your progress.

Relax, or instead use your anxiety to your advantage.,
Try to focus on something complicated and non-sexual.,
Get a change of scenery.,
Give yourself mild pain.",How to End an Erection1," Remember, seemingly random erections are normal and no reason for concern, and odds are that no one has noticed anyway. Take a few deep breaths, and keep calm. Worrying about your erection can cause you to focus even more on it and make it more difficult to end.That said, anxiety can actually be to your benefit in ending an erection. Stress causes a ""fight or flight"" reaction in the body, which includes the redistribution of blood towards the arms and legs. Drawing blood away from your genitals can help end your erection.So, the best advice may be not to worry about having an erection, but feel free to worry about other things that may distract and deflate your problem.;
, You may have heard the old joke that men have only enough blood to supply either their brains or their penises at any one time, but there is some validity to the idea that distracting the mind can help bring about detumescence (the return of a penis to its flaccid state).Try to occupy your mind with something besides sex, but don't try to forget about your erection. In other words, don't think to yourself, ""OK, I'm thinking about baseball now. Definitely not my erection."" Your erection won't go away until you are fully focused on something else. Force yourself to perform a task that takes a lot of mental concentration: play a musical instrument, read, exercise, or solve a math problem.
If you can't distract yourself by doing an activity, try to visualize it in your head. If you're in a social situation and you can't distract yourself without arousing suspicion, imagine yourself doing something different. If you love playing guitar, imagine every little detail: where you're putting your fingers, how you're strumming, how the song sounds.

, Sometimes, the best way to distract yourself is to go somewhere else for a while. If the erection was triggered by someone or something in the room, it might be difficult to end it until you leave the room. Give yourself five minutes to calm down, then return with renewed resolve.Ignore sexual stimuli. Don't allow yourself to see, hear, or experience anything arousing. Distract your senses by diving into things that take a lot of attention. If you can't stop noticing the attractive person in the seat next to you, force yourself to focus on the book in front of you.

, No legitimate medical authority will now recommend that you cause yourself any amount of pain to stop a natural and harmless body process, but the traditional notion that mild pain can end an erection is still out there. So long as you only cause yourself very mild pain (mainly as a distraction), it is unlikely to be a problem to give it a try.


Try, for example, discreetly pinching your thigh. It's easy to hide, it won't seriously hurt you, but it can hurt enough to distract you.
If you're truly desperate, some people may recommend you try flicking a testicle through your pants. Don't flick too hard, though, or you might injure yourself!
Remember, it's never worth injuring yourself over an erection.
