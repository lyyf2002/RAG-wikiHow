Examine its size.,
Observe the color and length of its coat.,
Inspect the neck and back.,
Measure the height of its forelegs.,
Examine the chest and tail.",How to Identify a Kangal Dog2," Male Kangals can grow to a height of 30 to 40 inches and weigh 110 to 140 pounds. Female Kangals can grow to a height of 28 to 31 inches and weigh 90 to 120 pounds. As long as the balance between weight and height is maintained, a weight exceeding these parameters is not a disqualification.


In general, Kangals appear large, impressive, and powerful.

, The Kangal is a whole-colored dog. The color of its body can range from cream and pale fawn to gray dun. Its coat is never white, pinto, or brindled, however, it may have white markings on its chest or feet. Kangals also have a short, dense double-coat.Its hair lies flat and close to its body; it is neither wavy nor fluffy.
“Dun” refers to the black guard hairs in the coat. The more black guard hairs there are in its coat, the darker it will be.

, The Kangal has a powerful neck that is arched, muscular, and moderate in length. The hair around the neck and shoulders is slightly longer than its coat creating a protective barrier. The Kangal’s back is muscular and powerful. Its back is level with the withers, i.e., the base of the neck, and gradually arches over the loins.The length of the Kangal’s back (from prosternum, i.e., top of the sternum, to buttocks) is slightly longer than its height (from withers to the ground).

, The Kangal’s forelegs are relatively long. The length of its front legs (from the elbow to the ground) should measure a little more than 50 percent of its height. Additionally, its forelegs are straight and well-boned with its elbows close to its sides.For example, if the Kangal’s height is 18 inches, then the length of its forelegs should be a little over 9 inches.

, The Kangal’s chest is deep and extends to its elbows. Its ribs are well sprung with a distinct tuck up near its loins. The Kangal’s tail is long, reaching its hocks. When the Kangal is relaxed, the tail is carried low and has a slight curl at the end. On the other hand, when it is alert, the tail is carried high and curled in an open circle over its back.The length of the hair on the end of its tail is slightly longer than the hair on its body.

"
"
Examine its gait.,
Watch how the Kangal interacts with others.,
Talk to a breeder.",How to Identify a Kangal Dog3," The Kangal's gait is fluid and relaxed with strides of moderate length. When running, the Kangal has a single track gait. This means that the Kangal's legs converge to a single line as it runs faster. Kangals also have a high endurance and are fast and agile.When viewed from the side, the top of the head, neck, and back of the Kangal form a straight line. This gives it an appearance of stalking.

, Because Kangals were traditionally used to guard livestock, they possess a temperament that is typical of these types of dogs, i.e., territorial, alert, and defensive. However, although Kangals are guard dogs, they possess a calm and reasonable temperament. They are also very intelligent and independent.They are not naturally aggressive dogs, however, they can be bold, dominant and territorial if challenged.

, A Kangal breeder should be able to distinguish between a pure bred and a non-pure bred Kangal. Ask your local Kangal breeder for clarifications concerning the Kangal’s physical appearance and temperament.


Find local breeders through The United Kennel Club’s website, as well as the Kangal Dog Club of America’s website.

Look at the texture and length of the dog’s coat.,
Note the coloring of the dog’s coat.,
Check for other breed markings on the dog.",How to Identify a Collie2," Collies come in two different varieties, the Rough Collie and the Smooth Collie. The coat of the Smooth Collie is short, dense and flat. The Rough Collie has a long, well-fitted coat that feels a bit more harsh. The Rough Collie has a thick long coat all over it body, save its head and legs.Both varieties have a soft, profuse undercoat.
Keep in mind in the United States, many breeders will cross the two varieties together. But in England, the two varieties are considered separate breeds and cannot be interbred., Collies are known for the distinct coloring on their coats. There are four different colorings, with the most common being the sable color. The sable coloring can range from light golden tan to dark mahogany.The second most common coloring is the tricolor, which is a mix of black, white, and tan. The third most common coloring is Blue Merle, which can range from a pale, silvery blue to a darker gray, with or without black body spots.
The fourth most common coloring is white. A white Collie may have a body that is mostly white, with tricolor or blue markings, usually on their head.

, Nearly all Collies, no matter the variety or coloring, will have certain breed markings on their coat. They will have a white collar, chest, legs, feet, and tail tip. They may also have facial markings that are white, called a blaze."
"
Notice if the dog is energetic and active.,
Listen for any barking or “singing.” Because Collies were originally herding dogs, they can be quite vocal and communicative.,
Check if the dog gets along with other dogs.",How to Identify a Collie3," Collies are known for their intelligence and their energetic nature. They are an active breed and enjoy running in the woods, going for walks, or playing outside. In general, Smooth Collies can be more energetic, athletic and agile than Rough Collies, who are often calmer and more reserved.Collies bond quickly with their owners and will be very protective of them. They may be dignified and reserved around strangers, but will soon warm up to them.
Collies often form a strong connection with their owners and are highly trainable, making them ideal family dogs.

, They may make a range of sounds, from barking to grunts to “singing,” where the Collie makes noises that sound like someone singing.Collies also have noticeable facial expressions, from cocking their head to one side and puffing their cheeks. They are often expressive around their owner, with a tendency to nod, smile, and nudge people or objects with their nose.

, Due to their shepherding heritage, Collies are known to get along with other dogs and animals in the same space or household. Collies are used to shepherding multiple dogs together and communicating with other animals. This breed tends to function well with a household of animals and is often tolerant of other pets."
"
Notice the dog's loyalty.,
Recognize the dog's energy level.,
See if the dog is trainable.",How to Identify a German Shepherd4," German Shepherds can be fairly aloof and reserved when first meeting new people. However, once the dog has formed a connection with their owner, they are extremely loyal. German Shepherds are usually friendly and loyal to their family, but can be protective if they feel threatened., German Shepherds are high energy dogs and they need lots of daily exercise. If a German Shepherd is left a lone for long periods of time it will likely become bored and destructive. For example, the dog may start barking, chewing things, or digging. Make sure that your German Shepherd receives at least 1 hour of exercise each day., This breed is highly intelligent and trainable. They like to have a job or task to do, and you can train a German Shepherd to do a variety of different jobs. For example, German Shepherd's are often used as ""working"" dogs, helping with search and rescue, drug sniffing and security, as well as providing aide and assistance to the visibly impaired.Take your German Shepherd to obedience classes to train the dog to follow commands and complete a variety of tasks. This is fun and stimulating for the dog.

Decide how much you want to know.,
Check your purebred dog's pedigree.,
Ask your veterinarian about breed possibilities.,
Consider DNA testing.,
Order the DNA test.",How to Determine Your Dog's Breed1," If you are just casually curious about your pup's breed makeup, you might be able to figure it out based on their appearance. If you want to know if your dog is predisposed to any health issues based on their breed, however, then you may need to go to the experts.If so, relying on documentary evidence, expert assistance, and/or scientific analysis will prove more helpful.


For instance, if you find out your dog is part Doberman Pinscher, you will know that they are predisposed to heart disease and certain neck and spine issues. You can then inform your vet so they know to watch for any signs and symptoms as well as educating yourself on these health issues.;
, Most purebred owners are well aware of their prized pup's pedigree, but sometimes records are lost or forgotten. If your dog is a purebred but that's all you know, you may still be able to find out more information.


If you are confident your dog is not purebred, skip to the next step.
If you acquired your purebred according to the regulations of the kennel club to which it belongs, you should be able to retrieve pedigree information either online or in hard copy by contacting the club with your dog's registration number.
If you don't have this information, you may still be able to figure out which kennel club is likely to have the relevant records, and you may still be able to retrieve pedigree information through an online search of their records.

, Your vet sees dogs all day, has a lot of experience with a wide variety of breeds, and can probably provide some valuable insights about your dog's background.


Ask his or her opinion about what breed your dog might be. They may have a very good idea or they may give you some suggestions that you will have to further investigate.
You could also ask a groomer or breeder and see what ideas they have about your dog’s breed. They see dogs all day as well, after all.

, A quick online search will reveal that several companies now offer DNA testing kits for dogs, which can determine which breeds are present in your canine. Remember that not all home tests are created equal — the accuracy of the results depends on the size of their reference database. A less expensive test may save you money, but will likely have a smaller database, which will provide less accurate information.


For instance, a test might be able to tell you that your mutt is 60% lab with 30% dachshund and 10% of ""other"" in the mix.

, If you decide to go this route, there are several options that vary by precision, complexity, and price (all of which tend to increase together).


Tests ranging from $60 and up are available both online and in many pet supply stores. Most of the kits require a cheek swab sampling. Some more expensive ones may require a blood test from a veterinarian's office.
To swab your dog's cheek, first check to make sure there is no food or debris stuck between their cheek and gums. Open the swab that comes with the kit (avoid touching the bristles) and lift your dog's lip. Place the swab against the inner surface of your dog's lip, then lower the lip. Twirl the swab and move it back and forth a little, gently holding your dog's mouth shut. Allow the swab to dry for about five minutes, then place it in the container provided.The results come in two to four weeks either by mail or email.For a list of reputable labs, visit the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals site (http://www.offa.org/dna_labs.html).
Regardless of the limitations and costs associated with DNA testing, this is the most scientific, and likely most accurate, way to determine your mutt's breed profile.

Look at the markings.,
Acknowledge rare colour variations.,
Feel the dog’s coat.,
Determine if the dog sheds.",How to Identify a Dalmatian1," The best way to identify a Dalmatian is by looking at the dog’s markings. Dalmatians are white dogs that have round black or reddish brown spots. Ideally the spots should be distributed across the entire body and there should be no large patches.Spots are usually smaller on the head, legs, and tail.When Dalmatians are born they are completely white in colour and develop spots as they age.;
, Some Dalmatians may have dark blue or tricoloured spots. These colour variations are not accepted as the breed standard for dog shows, but they can still be found on some Dalmatians. Typically tricoloured Dalmatians will be white with dark spots, as well as a few brown patches located on the head, legs, chest, and tail.Some Dalmatians may have large black patches on their coat.

, The Dalmatian has a short, smooth, and silky coat. When you pet a Dalmatian, the top of their head feels velvety., Dalmatians shed considerably throughout the year. Brush the dog’s hair frequently in order to manage the shedding."
"
Look for a wrinkled forehead.,
Check that both ears are large and erect.,
Measure and weigh the dog.,
Inspect the dog's coat.,
Look for a curled tail.,
Check with an expert.,
Listen to what noises the dog makes.,
Observe the dog’s social demeanor.,
Look for cat-like grooming behavior.,
Expect destructive, inquisitive behavior when left alone.,
Observe the dog’s obedience.,
Look for chasing and hunting behaviors.",How to Identify a Basenji Dog," One of the Basenji’s most distinctive features is its forehead, which displays a Shar-Pei-like wrinkle at all times. This can lend a puzzled or anxious expression to its face, but it’s just the natural fold and texture of its skin.This wrinkle may seem more pronounced in puppies, who have more excess skin and folds. It will also be less noticeable in Basenjis with brindled, black, or tricolored coats.;
, Looking at a Basenji, you may recall the sharp, pointed ears of the ancient Egyptian god Anubis. This resemblance is not accidental: in fact, the Basenji is one of the most ancient dog breeds and appears in many Egyptian hieroglyphs as early as 4000 B.C.The Basenji’s ears stand at the top of the flat skull and point directly upward. Many experts argue that this adaptation derives from the fact that Basenjis use both sight and sound to hunt. It’s also thought that the large surface area of the ears helps to dissipate heat.

, Basenjis are medium-sized dogs, measuring 16-17 inches at the shoulder and 16-17 inches from chest to buttocks. They are lightly-built dogs, weighing 22-24 pounds.Expect female Basenjis to fall on the lower end of height and weight averages, typically weighing one to two pounds less than males and standing one inch shorter.

, A Basenji has short, fine fur. Their most recognizable color is perhaps chestnut red, but they also occur in pure black, tricolor (pure black and chestnut red), and brindle—that is, black stripes on a background of chestnut red.No matter what color the coat is, a Basenji will have white on the feet, chest, and tip of the tail. Sometimes the legs and collar will also be white.

, Aside from the Basenji’s erect ears and wrinkled forehead, its tightly curled tail is perhaps its most notable characteristic. Curling back over the dog’s rump, the tail starts thick at its base and tapers into a thinner point.The tightness of the tail’s curl depends on the Basenji’s current mood and excitement level. The more stimulated and buoyant the dog is, the more tightly curled the tail will be.

, If you're having trouble deciding whether or not a dog is a Basenji, ask a local expert to help. A veterinarian should be able to check for distinguishing characteristics, or you could visit a local dog club where they might have an expert who can identify this particular breed.

, The larynx of the Basenji is shaped differently from most other dogs, meaning that the Basenji doesn’t make the same barking sound that other dogs do. It’s largely silent, making it a great dog for people who have small children or live in apartment buildings.When the Basenji does make a noise, it does so in a whining cry, howl, drawn-out yodel, or short, isolated “fox bark.”, Most Basenji owners remark that Basenji’s behavior more closely resembles that of cats than that of a typical dog. Stubborn, independent, and reserved, it likes to play, but it is unlikely to be a social butterfly in the dog park or with your visiting friends.Like a cat, most Basenjis will form a close bond with only one or two members of the household.
Some owners report that Basenjis bond better with dogs of other breeds than they do with dogs of their own breed., Unlike many dog breeds, the Basenji is a fastidious self-groomer and pays particular attention to its paws. Such scrupulousness means that it rarely requires human-assisted bathing and emits minimal odor.In addition to their curiously feline grooming habits, look for little to no shedding., Perhaps one of the most notable behavioral characteristics of the Basenji is its curiosity, craftiness, and destructiveness when left alone. Many Basenji owners report having to keep all cabinets and garbage receptacles tightly locked and countertops kept clean, as their dogs can get into practically anything when left to their own devices.Basenjis will devour any accessible edibles or household products, and they also love to shred paper products, such as tissues, toilet paper, and paper towels.

, While Basenjis make great household pets, they aren’t the easiest dogs to train. Their independent natures and ancient instincts make them less submissive than other breeds, so an owner will have to be firm and consistent when handling them.Due to their stubbornness and independence, a Basenji responds best to positive reinforcement. When training their dogs, Basenji owners report best results when rewarding positive behavior with treats rather than scolding or jerking the leash when it does something wrong., Due to their long histories as hunting dogs, Basenjis love to chase anything and everything, including other dogs, squirrels, cats, and small children. Basenjis can still coexist with cats or other dogs, but these other pets will have to either get used to being pursued or learn not to run away from the chase-happy Basenji.A Basenji should not be trusted off the leash in the way that some obedient, low-key breeds can. Likely to bolt the minute it spots a dashing squirrel or dog, it’s particularly vulnerable to getting hit by cars and getting lost."

Look for the distinctive black and tan coloring.,
Expect a large, tall body.,
Look for long, floppy ears.,
Check for jowls and a long muzzle.,
Watch the dog’s tail.",How to Identify a Black and Tan Coonhound1," As its name might imply, the black and tan coonhound’s coat is a dark black with tan accents that can be found on its face, neck, legs, and chest. Most black and tan coonhounds have distinctive tan spots above their eyes called “pumpkin seeds.”A black and tan coonhound’s coat will be short and dense.;
, A black and tan coonhound is a larger-sized dog. The dog has a long-boned body that resembles that of the bloodhound but is slightly more compact.Male coonhounds measure 25 to 27 inches (64 to 69 cm) at the shoulder, while females measure 23 to 25 inches (58 to 64 cm) at the shoulder. Males and females weigh between 55 and 75 pounds (25 to 34 kg)., Like other members of the hound family, the black and tan coonhound has distinctively long ears. These floppy ears hang down below the dog’s jaw and flap as the animal runs. The ears are black, like much of its body, and improve the dog’s sense of smell by wafting the scent towards its nose., The black and tan coonhound has a long oval-shaped head. The elongated shape is due to its long muzzle and powerful nose. In addition, the black and tan coonhound has droopy jowls that hang down off its muzzle. All of these features facilitate the coonhound’s renowned sense of smell., A black and tan coonhound will have a fairly long, thin tail that tapers at the end. When the dog is in action (such as following a scent), it’s tail will perk up and bend at a slight right angle."

The instructions will provide you with steps on how to take a DNA swab and then how to return the results to the lab for testing.Each kit is only designed to test the DNA of one dog.

, The kit will likely come with two swabs. They are both to be used on the same dog. Open your dog’s mouth and rub the swab across the inside of the dog’s cheek. Do the same thing with each of the swabs., Place the swabs into the plastic baggies provided. Then place them in the pre-paid return envelope or box. Once sealed, mail the results to the lab for testing., Approximately three weeks after you complete the test, you will receive detailed DNA results. Your dog’s DNA will be compared to approximately 200 different breeds. If you have a German Shepherd, a DNA test will easily be able to identify this breed.The results can even test to see if your dog is a mixed-breed that is part German Shepherd.

Accept the limitations of visual identification.,
Write down your dog's defining characteristics as you identify them.,
Determine the dog's weight and height.,
Assess the build of your dog.,
Look at other physical characteristics.,
Evaluate the fur.,
Assess the color of your dog.,
Use the visual clues you have recorded to search for breeds and make your ""best guess.""",How to Determine Your Dog's Breed2," While it is nice to think that an expert in particular should be able to identify a dog's breed makeup just by looking over the animal, this method is not the most accurate.


One study on visual dog breed identification found that even self-described ""dog experts"" were only able to correctly identify a predominant breed in a mixed-breed dog about 27% of the time.Regardless of accuracy concerns, however, identification by visual appearance is the most likely method for use by the average mutt owner, and often sufficient to satisfy a general curiosity. Best of all, it's free.

, Make a list that ranks your dog's distinguishing features from most to least prominent (such as large, pointy ears versus average build). This will help you narrow your search for likely breed(s).

, If you don't have a pet scale, weigh yourself and then weigh yourself holding your dog. The difference between the two weights is the weight of your dog. Of course, you can also get your pet’s weight at any veterinary office.


Take measuring tape and measure your dog from front to back, top to bottom, and left to right.
These general measurements will allow you to rule out breeds that are drastically different from your dog. For instance, if your dog weighs 50 pounds, you will know that you don't have a small toy breed.
Toy dogs (5 – 10 pounds) may include Chihuahuas and Shi Tzus, for instance; dogs in the middle range (10 – 50 pounds), may perhaps be terriers or spaniels; large dogs (50 – 100 pounds) could be setters or retrievers; and dogs over 100 pounds likely have some element of Saint Bernard, Mastiff, or other giants in their breed mix.If your dog is a puppy, seek out an online calculator that will let you use puppy age and weight to estimate adult weight., Make note of any defining characteristics you notice. Do you have a large, medium or small-framed dog? Deep chested? Is your dog more muscular or slender in build?


If you have a puppy, you may have to wait until it is fully mature for all characteristics to become apparent.
Think about what the build of your dog might mean about its skills. This may help you narrow down the breed group. For instance, if your dog has long legs and is slender, your dog may be a herding dog.

, Look at your dog's snout, skull, back, legs, and tail, and note any distinctive elements.


Dogs like Pugs and Bulldogs have round skulls and very short snouts (brachycephalic), whereas Collies and Greyhounds have long snouts and narrow skulls (dolichocephalic). Mesocephalic dogs have skulls that most of us think are balanced (not exaggerated), like that of a Labrador or an Australian Shepherd.
Visit How to Identify Your Adopted Mutt for several examples of physical characteristics that can often be tied to certain breeds or breed groups.

, Is the fur long or short or heavy with undercoat? Is the texture coarse or soft? Some breeds, like Dachshunds, have long backs and short legs and three different types of fur-coat: long, short and wiry. Other breeds only have one type of fur, like the short semi-spiky velvet of the Chinese Shar-Pei breed or the white fluffy fur of the American Eskimo breed.


There are a wide variety of types of dog fur. Rottweilers tend to only have short black and mahogany fur with specific markings on the head and chest. Many (not all) terriers have wiry coats with short, stocky bodies like that of the Cairn Terrier, the Miniature Schnauzer and the Jack Russell (aka Parsons) terrier. Poodles have the distinction of having curly coats of springy curls in a variety of sizes and colors., What color is the fur? Is there a pattern to the coat color? Some breeds typically come in only one or a few colors or patterns, which may help narrow the possibilities.


For example, German Shorthair Pointer dogs usually come in liver and white and Vizslas are a solid copper color. There are breeds that also come in a merle pattern where diluted black or red colors are mixed in with white like the blue merle Australian Shepherd or Shetland Sheepdog.

, No matter how detailed your description is, you'll never be able to make a completely accurate determination of your dog's breed. However, with the help of one or more dog breed description guides, you can at very least eliminate many possibilities.


There are numerous online options for dog breed searches, which use photos and brief character trait descriptions to help you find matches for your mutt.Some also break down the categories by dog size, from ""toy"" to XL.The American Kennel Club (AKC) breed search, for example, provides images and brief descriptions of characteristics common to each breed.Eliminate breed groups that don't fit your dog's characteristics. After that, go through pictures and descriptions of breed groups that are similar to your dog.
Remember that your dog is quite possibly a mix of several different breeds. If your dog has some striking characteristics that match a breed, but it doesn't match completely, it may only partially be that breed.

Use a dog breed identification app.",How to Identify a Dalmatian2," Dalmatians are considered a large dog breed with a strong muscular build. The average Dalmatian is about 20-24 inches (50-60cm) tall at the shoulders and weighs 48-55 pounds (22-25kg). Dalmatians have a deep chest and thin tail. Their feet are round with arched toes and the toe nails can be either black or white.In order to measure the height of a Dalmatian, use a tape measure and record the distance from the ground to the top of the dog’s shoulders.

, The head of a Dalmatian has a similar width and length and the top is flat. Their nose can be black, dark brown, blue or grey and their eyes are brown, blue, or a combination of both., Dalmatians can vary in size based on the individual dog. It is for example, possible to have larger or smaller Dalmatians. This is typically a result of environmental and care factors. For instance, a Dalmatian that is overfed may appear much larger than the breed standard.

, There are a variety of applications available that can identify different dog breeds. In order to use these apps, upload a photo of a dog and the app will identify the breed.For example, try the Microsoft application called Fetch!
These apps are not always 100% accurate, but the Dalmatian is fairly easy to identify because of the unique spots.

Listen for a loud bark.,
Look for constant sniffing.,
Notice if the dog is stubborn.",How to Identify a Black and Tan Coonhound2," Black and tan coonhounds have an extremely loud and distinctive bark that can be heard for miles. The notable “arf arf” of the black and tan coonhound resembles the sound that a seal makes but in a much deeper tone. The dog often lets out this noisy bark when they are excited by a new scent or are playing., Like other members of the hound family, the black and tan coonhound loves to sniff. When on a walk, the dog will constantly sniff its surroundings and, when it encounters a new human, will give them a thorough smelling. Because its urge to sniff is so strong that it can wander off, the black and tan coonhound needs a leash when walked and a securely fenced backyard., Black and tan coonhounds can be difficult dogs to train. They are easily distracted and can be rambunctious. However, if trained properly, they can be very useful hunting dogs."

Although it is not the most accurate means of identifying whether your dog is a black and tan coonhound, it might help you get a better understanding of its heritage., For a more accurate detailing of your dog’s background, you might want to purchase a commercial DNA testing kit. A kit can be ordered online and used in the comfort of your home. Simply swab the inside of your dog’s mouth and mail the sample back to the company for testing. Once the testing is complete, you will get a set of results that tell you whether your dog is a black and tan coonhound.Some kits use a blood sample instead of a cheek swab, which will need to be collected by your veterinarian. While less convenient than swab tests, blood tests decrease the chance of a contaminated sample."

Examine their large, low-hanging ears.,
Note the shape of the dog’s skull.,
Look for telling facial characteristics.,
Note the tension of the dog’s skin.",How to Identify a Basset Hound1," Basset Hounds' ears are perhaps their most recognizable physical feature. They are very large and long enough to nearly touch the ground when the dog is tracing a scent. The size helps these large ears serve a purpose: they effectively sweep scent forward towards the dog's nose.If your gently draw an ear forward, it will easily fold over the front of a Basset Hound's nose. Their ears will also be velvety to the touch.
Since the ears are set very low on a Basset Hound's head, they may look as though they are growing out of the dog's neck, especially when the dog is sitting down.
Even as puppies, Basset Hounds will have very large ears. This feature is so prominent that it can help identify a Basset Hound puppy without seeing the dog's parents.;
, The head of a Basset Hound is larger and well-proportioned to its shoulders and body. Its skull will be longer than it is wide. Most Basset Hound skulls will have a visible dome and noticeable bump on the back. The muzzle will be about equal in length to the rest of the skull.When you look at the dog’s head from the side, the top of the skull and the muzzle will both be flat and on parallel planes.

, Basset Hound noses are darkly colored, and they have wide nostrils that seem to be held open. The lips are also darkly colored, and hang heavily from the dog’s mouth. Overbites and underbites are relatively uncommon in this breed. A Basset Hound’s sunken brown eyes are also especially recognizable, and will likely strike you as soft and sad., Basset Hounds have heavy, loose, and elastic skin, especially on their heads. Watch when the dog lowers its head to the ground; distinct wrinkles will show above its eyes. The dewlap, or the flap of skin hanging lengthwise beneath the dog’s head and neck, will be very prominent."

Pay attention to its lean, level build.,
Observe its well-angled shoulders.,
Look for a glossy black and tan coat.,
Check for its signature tan facial markings.",How to Identify a Gordon Setter1," Gordon setters are a considered to be large dogs, and they are the heaviest of the setters.When measured from its feet to its withers, or to its shoulder blades, a male Gordon setter typically stands 26 in tall (66 cm) and weighs around 65 lbs (29.5 kg). A female typically stands around 24.5 in (62 cm) and weighs around 56 lbs (25.5 kg)., The Gordon setter has a sturdy and substantial build. It has a long, well-arched neck, and its chest is muscular but not broad.Its back is relatively level and only slopes downward toward the rear slightly. The length of its body is considered to be short from the shoulders to the hips., This breed has well-defined angles between its shoulders and the upper arm. The blades are close together, which makes the neck and shoulders fit together seamlessly. When the dog is standing with its foreleg perpendicular to the ground, there should be a 90-degree angle where the shoulder blades met the upper arm bone., Gordon setters have a long, wavy coat that can sometimes be straight. They have a distinguished, recognizable coal-black coat and tan markings that sets them apart from other setters. They have tan markings on the throat, chest, on the inside of the hind legs and thighs, and on the forelegs up to the elbows.A Gordon setter can sometimes have a small white spot on its chest.This breed should be brushed two or three times each week to prevent its long coat from matting.A Gordon setter puppy will have these typical tan markings.

Recognize potential problems.",How to Train a Dog to Pee Outside," Having a daily routine is important for dogs of any age, but it's especially important for younger dogs. A puppy can typically only hold his bladder for one hour per every month of age, meaning that young puppies may need to go outside once every hour.It's best to establish a routine as quickly as possible with your dog to ensure that he doesn't have any problems.


In addition to the correlation between number of months of age and number of hours a puppy can wait to go out, it's also important to let your dog out first thing in the morning, during or after play time, and after he's eaten a meal or drank a lot of water. This time also refers to the maximum length of time he can hold on (i.e. at night). When house breaking a puppy, it is important to offer him a toilet break every 20- 30 minutes for training purposes.;
, Whether you walk your dog or let him outside in a fenced-in enclosure, it's important for your dog to have a routine spot where he urinates. This can be a tree that you pass near your home, or a certain spot in the yard. Whatever spot your dog chooses, it's important to let him always have access to that spot while you are training him to urinate outdoors., Try associating a verbal command with your dog's chosen bathroom spot, or with any spot that you pass immediately after leaving the house. You can say something like, ""Go potty,"" or ""Go pee"" every time he urinates in that spot. Over time, your dog will hear that command and recall the associated act of urinating., Whenever your dog follows your command of ""go potty"" when you let him outside, immediately praise him and give him a treat within three seconds of the positive behavior. It's important to follow rewards or praise immediately after positive behavior, as dogs have a hard time associating actions and praise if too much time has passed., As your dog's training continues, you may want to slowly reduce the frequency of food treats after he relieves himself, eventually phasing them out altogether. Treats are an important and helpful part of training early on, but rewarding your dog with food every time he relieves himself should not become a lifelong habit., Crate training is a great method to incorporate when trying to housebreak your dog. Dogs come to view the crate as a sort of den within your home, and no dog wants to voluntarily soil the den.However, crates are not a simple fix. Crate training takes time and patience, and you'll need to make sure your dog is comfortable in his crate.


Crates come in a variety of materials and versions. There are plastic crates that are typically used for traveling, and there are metal crates with folding/collapsing frames. Choose a type of crate that will be most conducive to your needs, and be sure it's something your dog will not be able to chew or destroy easily, if that is a concern with your pet.Choose the right size. A crate should ideally be just large enough for an adult dog to stand upright, turn around in it, and and lie down with his legs extended. If a crate is too big, your dog may designate one corner of the crate as a bathroom spot. If it's too small, your dog will be cramped and uncomfortable.If your dog is young and you expect that he will continue to grow, talk to your veterinarian about how to measure a crate that will fit your dog's anticipated adult body size., If you try to toss your dog into a crate without any proper introductions, he may become traumatized and fearful of the crate. It's best to introduce a new crate slowly, by encouraging your dog to explore the crate and using gentle, reassuring tones whenever he approaches it.Try leaving the door to the crate open and periodically dropping treats in the crate. Start by leaving treats near the door, and progressively drop the treats further inside the crate.Let your dog explore the crate whenever he wants. Leave the door open so that he feels like he can go inside at his leisure., Once your dog is comfortable and acclimated to venturing inside his new crate, you'll want to begin feeding him his meals inside the crate. This will help him get accustomed to going into the crate as a part of daily life.Close the door of the crate while your dog is eating. When you first begin doing this, you'll want to open the crate as soon as your dog finishes his meal, so he doesn't become frightened. You can gradually increase the amount of time you leave the door closed, adding a minute or two every couple of days.If your dog begins to whine, cry, or bark, do not let him out right away. Wait until he stops acting out before opening the crate. If you open the door whenever he barks, he will begin to think that barking gets him out whenever he wants.Once your dog is comfortable staying in the crate for close to a half hour without incident, it is safe to start leaving your dog in the crate when you leave the house for brief errands, and you may want to consider leaving him in the crate overnight. Expect this process to take up to several weeks before your dog is comfortable being left alone in the crate., After your dog has proven capable of being left alone for brief periods of time, you can begin leaving him in the crate when you leave the house. It's best to prolong putting your dog inside the crate until you are almost ready to leave; otherwise he may get anxious and fail to understand why he's locked inside while you're still home.Be sure to let your dog outside to relieve himself right before you put him in the crate. Failing to give your dog adequate outdoor time before being crated could increase the likelihood of his having accidents when you're not home.Never use the crate as punishment. You do not want your dog to associate the crate with being yelled at or punished. As long as you continue to feed him in his crate and only use the crate for training purposes (such as preventing him from destroying the house while you're not home), he should have only positive associations with the crate., Your dog will inevitably have occasional accidents, even after successfully house training him. Accidents may happen frequently during the training process. It's important to remember that your dog did not mean to have an accident, and that he will eventually learn not to make it a habit.Do NOT yell at your dog or rub his face in the mess when he has an accident. This does not help your dog learn from his mistakes, and it may cause him to become fearful of you. Take accidents in stride and be patient with your pet., Any time you observe your dog urinating in the house, make a startling noise, like clapping your hands or saying ""Go outside"". Then take your dog outside and praise him if he finishes relieving himself outdoors., Dogs have a keen sense of smell, and may come to associate a former accident spot as an acceptable bathroom location if the smell is not properly cleaned away. This can be especially problematic in younger puppies.Use an enzymatic cleaner to thoroughly remove odors after accidents indoors.If you have a yard, you can use indoor accidents as a training tool. Any time you clean up an indoor accident, take the urine-soaked paper towels outside to the dog's usual bathroom area. Leave the paper towels outside on the ground, using a rock or stick to secure them in place. Once your dog smells his urine on the paper towels, he will firmly associate going to the bathroom with being outside. As soon as your dog learns the lesson and begins relieving himself outside again, you can remove the soiled paper towels.

, If your dog is having a hard time refraining from relieving himself indoors, it's possible that he's suffering from a medical ailment or emotional problem. Consult your veterinarian to determine whether your dog has any of the following problems:

Identify the signs of submissive urination.,
Don't scold or punish your dog for urinating.,
Greet the dog while avoiding dominant behaviors.,
Encourage confident postures and greetings.,
Take your puppy outside to urinate frequently.,
Introduce new people and experiences gradually.,
Spend relaxed time with your dog.,
Train your dog to provide alternative submissive responses.,
Consult with your veterinarian.",How to Train a Puppy to Not Pee when Greeted1," Submissive urination is a behavior common to puppies and younger dogs. The dog will respond to scolding or being greeted by urinating to show submission. The dog will usually show other signs of submissive behavior, such as:Cowering or crouching on the ground
Tucking tail between back legs
Exposing belly or rolling over
Whining or yelping;
, While it is tempting to try to get your puppy to understand that urinating when greeted is wrong by scolding it, this will only reinforce the behavior. Remember that your puppy is urinating in order to show that it wants to obey you, and allow you to be dominant.You should also avoid praising or encouraging your puppy when they display submissive urination, as this can also reinforce the behavior. Simply ignore the behavior and clean up the mess.

, Many common gestures of greeting, such as petting a dog on the head, may be interpreted as gestures of dominance by your dog. Here are some suggestions for how to make your greetings less dominant:Speak softly and calmly, rather than in high pitched or excited tones.
Move slowly and gently, giving the dog time to see everything you do.
Let the puppy approach you, rather than reaching for them.
Look at the puppy's back or tail rather than looking into their eyes.
Pet the dog under the chin rather than on top of the head.
Greet the dog at their level by squatting, rather than leaning over them.
Approach from the side, rather than the front.
Greet your dog outdoors, whenever possible.

, Whenever your puppy greets you calmly, either sitting or standing, let them know you approve by praising them, scratching their chin, or offering them a treat. Remember to keep your response low-key to avoid frightening them, or confusing them into thinking they are being scolded., This will keep their bladder empty, making it less likely that they will display submissive urination. Don't fuss over or praise your dog while they are doing their business, but simply let them ""do their thing"". Praising a dog for urinating can be confusing for them, and may encourage submissive urination., A dog displaying submissive urination is very insecure, and will often be frightened if they are suddenly confronted with something new. Be mindful of this, and allow your puppy to explore at their own pace whenever possible. This will help build their confidence, reducing their insecurity and potentially reducing their submissive urination.Encourage your friends and family to avoid dominant behaviors when greeting your puppy.
Avoid crowds, loud noise or other confusing, intense activity until your puppy has grown up a little and is more confident.

, Don't feel the need to constantly speak to, pet or play with your puppy, but instead simply sit with them and ""chill out"". This will let your puppy know that you are comfortable with them being around you. You should also spend plenty of time in positive, engaging activities with your dog, such as walking outdoors, obedience training, and simple games such as fetch., Remember that your puppy is trying to communicate submissiveness to you, but doesn't yet know what the rules are. Give them an alternative to urination, such as simple commands like ""sit"", ""shake"" or ""roll over"". When you greet your dog, give them the command you have trained, then reward their obedience. This will allow them to display their submissiveness to you without urinating.If you have trouble training your dog, or just don't have time, consulting a professional dog trainer is a great option.

, If your puppy continues to urinate when greeted, your vet can determine if some medical condition is contributing to the problem. They will also be able to suggest training classes, medications, and supplements which may help."

Expect plenty of slobbering and drooling, not to mention audible snoring and a good deal of shedding.
You’ll hear a fair amount of baying and howling, especially when the dog is bored.
Finally, be aware that you’ll smell them - both the odor of their coats and their gassy digestion is well renowned.

Ignore excitement urination.,
Give your puppy plenty of exercise.,
Take your puppy outside to urinate more frequently.,
Use trained commands to calm your dog down.",How to Train a Puppy to Not Pee when Greeted2," Dogs who suffer from excitement urination are often high-strung or energetic, and tend to urinate when something unexpected, frightening or thrilling happens. It is particularly common among immature dogs. If your puppy greets you with excitement, and begins urinating while running, jumping, standing on its hind legs or barking, it may be suffering from excitement urination.

, While you may be thrilled to see your puppy, you should avoid riling them up, and instead adopt a calm, encouraging approach. Here are some suggestions:Ignore your puppy until they are calm, then greet them calmly.
Move slowly and avoid reaching or gesturing towards the puppy.
Use a low, quiet tone of voice.
Avoid words that excite that the dog may have learned, such as ""walk"" or ""treat"".
Encourage guests to follow these guidelines as well.

, You may be tempted to scold your dog for urinating in an effort to teach them not to, but this will only agitate and excite them more.

Clean up after the dog.,
Prepare for different types of weather.",How to Take a Dog Out to Poop1," The first thing you want to do when taking your dog out is to call him and leash him up. You need to get him ready to go outside safely.


Decide whether you'll use a leash or harness/gentle handler. If your dog is still not properly leash trained, a harness or gentle handler, which leashes up around the dog's muzzle, might be a better choice. Younger dogs or dogs who haven't had much experience on a leash might pull and this can cause neck strain with a leash.Make sure your dog has all the proper licenses required in your area. It's a good idea to have a license with identifying information, such as your dog's name and your phone number.

, If your dog is still potty training, make sure to praise him for going outside. Always praise your dog the second he eliminates. You might want to provide a reward as well, like a small treat., If your dog eliminates outside, clean up after him. In many states, you will actually get a fine if you do not remove your dog's feces. Make sure you have bags with you before you take your dog out. You can buy doggy bags at most pet stores or supermarkets., If it's raining or snowing outside, your dog might not want to go out. Make sure you have a game plan in the event of poor weather conditions.


Create an ideal potty area. If your dog dislikes going on wet or snow covered ground, create an area in your yard for him to eliminate. Shovel out snow in a portion of the yard or have a small hut in place to prevent rainwater from falling on the ground.Try to make potty time fun. If weather conditions are poor, try to make bathroom time a fun experience for your dog. Take him for a long walk instead of just around the block. Take him on an exiting new route. If your dog is enjoying himself, he'll be distracted from the negative weather conditions."

Ask the owner.,
Ask your veterinarian.,
Talk with the breeder.,
Use a dog breed identification app.",How to Identify a Field Spaniel3," If you see a dog that you think might be a Field Spaniel and are curious about the breed, approach the owner and ask. For example, you could say something like “That is a beautiful dog. Is it a Field Spaniel by any chance?” Alternatively you could say “What kind of dog is that? I really like its colouring.”


Most dog owners will be happy to tell you about their dog and the breed.

, If you are unsure of your dog’s breed or lineage, ask your veterinarian to help you identify the breed. Veterinarians will be familiar with most dog breeds and will be able to examine the physical characteristics of the dog to help with identifying the breed.

, If you are purchasing a Field Spaniel from a breeder, you should talk with the breeder about the puppy’s parentage and lineage to make sure that you are getting a purebred dog. A licensed breeder will be able to provide you with paperwork that proves both parents are recognized as Field Spaniels by the American Kennel Club.

, There are a number of applications available that can identify different dog breeds. In order to use the app, upload a photo of a dog and the app will identify the breed.For example, try using the Microsoft app called Fetch!
These apps are not always 100% accurate.

Give your dog an anti-anxiety medicine.",How to Stop Dog Marking Behaviors," Dogs are naturally territorial, and their first priorities are to establish and protect the pack, its belongings and its territory. They do this largely through instinctual marking. Within a dog’s territory exist locations that he most particularly wants to protect, such as favorite feeding sites and dens.When a dog becomes a pet, he must find a compromise between his instinctual drive to rule his territory and the reality that this territory is not in the wild but instead in a home. Thus a pet dog’s territory includes your home, yard, parks and other locations he goes to regularly, the route of his normal walk, etc.It is very common for a dog to “re-mark” or “overmark” a site already marked by another dog in order to claim a territory as his own.Being territorial in your home and marking signals either a) the dog believes the things or places he marks “belong” to him and/or b) he thinks that item or space is under siege or in threat, generally from either a human or another pet.Marking also serves as an effective means for a dog to stake his claim and protect his territory without having to challenge each dog that sniffs about and goes into it.
And dogs mark in new environments to make them smell like home and to cover unfamiliar odors with theirs.
Anticipate and stop marking before it happens by intervening when you see your dog lifting his leg to urinate, particularly on vertical surfaces, new objects and around doors and windows. Female dogs will even do a handstand to raise their hind legs when marking.;
, Marking is also used to support the instinctual pack hierarchy and to let other dogs know when they’re ready to mate. A dog pack communicates amongst itself and with other packs in large part through their sense of smell. They’re able to learn the sex, identity and reproductive status of other dogs by sniffing the pheromones in their urine marking. In the home, dogs also stake claims on objects (particularly new objects) and spaces by marking. Additionally, they will mark when they feel anxiety about, for instance, having a new baby or pet in the home or when there are conflicts between animals.Male dogs are more likely to mark than females, and intact males mark 50-60% more than neutered males.
Females also mark, though less than males, and typically when they’re in heat. Nonetheless, spayed females also mark sometimes.Energetic or more dominant dogs tend to mark a lot because if in a pack, they’d pose the biggest threat to an interloper. Less confident dogs also mark a good deal, especially intimate objects, due to anxiety.
Experts generally agree that the best way to stop marking is to have your dog spayed or neutered.For maximum effectiveness, it must be done before your dog has reached maturity, or by about 6 months of age.
When active markers aren’t neutered until they are mature, behavior modification is generally required.

, Outside of spaying and neutering, this is the most important thing you can do to get your dog to stop marking. Dogs are not willfully disobedient. Once an area is marked, they are drawn back to the scent to mark again. Your role as the pet's leader is to teach them what is appropriate behavior and what isn't.


You won’t punish your dog after he has marked something. A dog lives in the moment, so by the time you punish your dog for marking he thinks he’s being punished for whatever he’s doing at the moment of punishment.
You will get to know members of his pack — as a friend, teacher and guardian — so you can identify and help fulfill each dog’s needs.
You will be consistent, firm, calm and confident, which will help your dog to feel secure.
You will cement your standing by attending to his need to work. Because dogs were bred to hunt and herd, give him a job to do, such as playing fetch or Frisbee, taking a walk, etc.

, Dogs will also mark when they have health problems, such as a bladder or urinary infection; in reaction to a medicine; due to incontinence and other medical issues. If your dog is urinating very quickly or more frequently than normal, take him to a vet., Your dog might have a submissive or excitement problem, especially if he marks during play, physical contact, greetings or scolding and punishment. If this is the case, your dog will often cringe or cower, roll over on his stomach, duck his head, avert his eyes, or flatten his ears. Address a submissive or excitement issue by greeting your dog outside and then ignoring him until he is calm when you go inside. Then tell him to sit as you look to the side and squat down to greet him.


Also, pet him only under the chin or chest, keep play low-key and use toys rather than bodily contact., His marking could also be because he isn’t totally house trained. If so, feed him on a consistent schedule and remove food between meals. Take him outside to eliminate frequently and keep an eye on him at all times to prevent accidents inside. You can also install a doggy door or confine him to a small room or crate if you can’t watch him at all times. Make sure to take him to the same place outside to eliminate and reward him for eliminating outside.


Clap loudly to startle but not scare him if you catch him in the act of marking inside.
You can also train him to eliminate on paper or in a dog litter box if he has mobility problems., He also may mark because he has separation anxiety, which is indicated when he seems nervous or upset right before you leave. To help him with this, use “counter conditioning,” in which you create a positive association with your leaving through giving him a puzzle toy or treat. It also involves shortening the time of separation for awhile before gradually increasing that time. Also teach him that when you pick up your keys, get your purse and briefcase or put on your coat (cues to him that you’re leaving), you aren’t always leaving..


You can demonstrate this to him by a) doing these things (e.g., picking up your keys) and then not leaving, b) by engaging in out-of-sight but not out-of-the-house separation, such as making him stay while you go into a room and shut the door, and c) by staying calm when you’re leaving or arriving home.
You can also desensitize his fear by having him experience low-intensity versions of being alone, such as taking him to work with you, having someone stay with him while you’re gone, putting him in a doggy daycare, and providing a lot of physical and mental stimulation through exercise, play, toys, etc., to decrease his stress.
If these things aren’t working, he may need to take an anti-anxiety medication., When you catch him in the act of marking, interrupt his marking, firmly say “No” or clap your hands, take him outside and reward him for eliminating outside.Catching him in the act and correcting his behavior can be extremely effective; however, there is a risk he will associate the punishment with you, and merely avoid toileting in that spot in your presence. Remember: Punishment won’t work because you won’t be able to punish him until the deed is done, and he will associate the punishment not with marking but with what he’s doing right then. Moreover, he isn’t doing it to be naughty or in retaliation.

, Exciting social situations can trigger marking. Try to keep a male dog away from female dogs in heat or away from other male dogs if you notice this increases marking. Avoid over-stimulating social situations, such as visiting a friend’s home where other dogs have marked., Keep objects that frequently make him mark put up. These might be new purchases, a visitor’s belongings, or things of yours he has negative associations with. Also don’t let other dogs in your home or yard if they will mark it. This will cause yours to over mark., A dog will often mark if he can see another dog outside. If you can't limit this access, try to keep other animals away from your house and yard.You could do this by installing fencing, asking your neighbor to keep his or her dog away if that is a problem, planting thorny or prickly plants along the perimeter of your yard, getting rid of your dog’s yard droppings, keeping food and water dishes inside or putting them up after outside use, removing standing water so other dogs won’t want to drink it, or spreading 1” chicken wire over newly seeded garden beds to discourage other dogs from digging., Dogs won’t mark in enclosed spaces, so crating while you’re away is an option. You can also put a crate or your dog’s bed over an area your dog frequently marks. He won’t mark what he sleeps on, and it can serve as a barrier for problem marking areas.


Other barriers include putting his food and water bowls over problem spots. If that seems to work, feed him there for two weeks and then move the bowls to either another problem area or back to their normal spot., If your dog only marks certain objects like your shoes, which can bring in other dogs’ marking scents, or in certain locations, put treats around these objects and spaces. This can help your dog regard these items and places as sources of food rather than triggers for his marking., Try putting down double-sided tape, a vinyl carpet runner turned upside down to expose the rough side, or other humane “booby” traps to keep him away from those areas. You can also feed, give treats, and play with your dog in these areas so he forms a new association with them. In doing this, that area can become an unpleasant place for him to mark., This is extremely important because dogs are attracted to spots they’ve already marked or that have been marked by a visiting dog. Masking the odor isn’t enough, however. You need to do your best to neutralize the odor. Soak the object (if possible) or spot with a pet urine enzymatic cleaner and let it dry. Don’t use a cleaner with ammonia because urine contains ammonia and will only attract your dog more to the object or space.Use fans or a blow dryer to speed up the drying, and don’t allow your dog access to the area as it dries.
If you’re trying to clean wall-to-wall carpeting, you may need to pull up the carpet to clean or replace the padding underneath.

, If you cannot stop your dog from marking, train him to mark in certain areas or on specific objects, such as a certain tree or a fake fire hydrant. Take him to a place he normally marks or expose him to objects he normally marks. Then immediately take him to the new marking area. Wait until he marks the new area and reward him with praise or a treat.


Don’t prevent your dog from marking while on walks. This will frustrate your dog and increase indoor marking., A variety of things can trigger enough anxiety to mark: new objects and people, new environments, separation from you or other members of the household, conflict with other pets, etc. What’s more is that marking caused by anxiety often results in the dog eliminating more urine than normal. It also causes them to mark more on non-vertical surfaces., If your dog and the other pet have been living together for quite some time and simply don’t get along, consult a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB), a Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Behavior (Dip ACVB) or a Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT) with experience in this area. You likely won’t be able to resolve their issues on your own.


Find a CAAB here , a Dip ACVB here and a CPDT here .

, The addition of a new pet to the household can increase your dog’s marking. Thus, you want to introduce them in a controlled manner, and slowly. The way in which you introduce them depends upon the type of animal you’re adding to your pet family.


If it’s a new dog, introduce them one at a time if you have multiple dogs and make this introduction in a neutral place that your resident dog doesn’t consider his territory. Talk to them in a happy and positive voice when they naturally sniff each other (don’t let them sniff each other too long in case they become aggressive). Then get their attention and give them a treat when they obey a command like sit or stay. Finally, take them for a walk together (continue praising and giving treats).
If it’s a new cat, let them first meet in your home. Then separate the animals for a few days, allowing each his or her turn to roam freely and investigate the other’s scent. Next have them in the same room but keep your dog on a leash until they are both calm and/or ignoring each other. After about one month, and when you are sure they won’t hurt each other, allow them unsupervised time around each other., Your dog may consider a new baby an intruder just as he does a new pet. Choose a quiet room for the introduction and sit down with your baby in your arms. Have someone else leash your dog and take him into the room, talking to him in a calm and happy voice. If your dog’s boy language is relaxed, bring the dog to the baby and allow him to sniff your baby’s feet for a few seconds if he wants, speaking softly to your dog. Then praise your dog and command him to sit or lie down before rewarding him with a treat.


Do this several times before having your helper distract your dog with a chew bone or a stuffed Kong toy (a rubber toy that you fill with food) and allow everyone to sit peacefully in the room together., Dogs can often perceive new roommates, house guests, and visitors as interlopers invading their territory. They also will tend to mark that person’s things. The best way for them to become friends is to have the new person feed, groom and play with your dog so they can bond. Both you, as Alpha, and the new person should use positive reinforcement, praising and giving treats to your dog when he is friendly.Keep the new person’s personal items up and out of the way so your dog can’t mark them.

, A Dog Appeasement Pheromone (DAP) device emits synthetic “appeasing pheromones” to mimic the ones a lactating mother dog secretes. They are calming hormones that help the dog relax.


A DAP diffuser should be used in a room that your dog uses or marks most. Simply plug it into an outlet; they work for about one month.DAP sprays should be sprayed 15 minutes prior to your dog entering the area. The effect usually lasts 1.5-2 hours.A DAP collar wraps around your dog’s neck and should be left in place until you change it one about one month. Cut off the extra collar material after you secure it., This should be a last resort and can only be obtained through your vet. It should be used along with behavior training as it will not eradicate your dog’s anxiety. They also are generally only given in short courses."

Maintain a consistent bathroom schedule.,
Designate a specific outdoor bathroom area.,
Do not play with your dog.,
Give your dog 10‒15 minutes to finish urinating.,
Reward your dog after it finishes urinating.,
Do not go inside immediately after your dog finishes urinating.",How to Stop a Dog from Urinating Inside After Going Outside1," A consistent bathroom schedule is a key component of proper house training. It will teach your dog to urinate outside at certain times, such as after waking up, after a meal, and about 20 minutes before going to bed. This is especially important for puppies, since they have weak bladder muscles and are still learning where they should urinate.Bathroom routines are important for adult dogs as well. Be mindful that even an adult dog can urinate inside if it wasn’t properly house trained as a puppy.;
, Having a specific outdoor bathroom spot will teach your dog to urinate outside, not inside. If you have a backyard, put your dog on a leash and take it to an area of the yard that’s protected from weather elements (rain, wind). Allow your dog to pick the exact bathroom spot within this area.Give your dog praise when it urinates in this area, or just shows interest in it.This will not be as important if your dog already has a specific bathroom spot, or you do not have a backyard.

, Playing with your dog can distract it from urinating completely. This is common in puppies, since they can become easily distracted. When you take your dog out, let it do its business without you playing with it.Consider just standing still until your dog finishes urinating., Unless your dog’s bladder is full, your dog may not urinate completely as soon as it gets outside. Your dog may need some time before its bladder muscles relax enough for urination. Also, if you have a puppy, it may need a few minutes to get focused on going to the bathroom.Don’t be surprised if your dog urinates several times. It may need to make several ‘pit stops’ to urinate completely., Give your dog verbal praise, and maybe a treat, when it finishes urinating. This will reinforce the idea that urinating outside is the right thing to do. If you want to give your dog treats, keep them hidden until after it finishes urinating. If your dog sees the treats, it may get distracted from going to the bathroom., If you’re in a rush, you may want to go back inside as soon as your dog finishes urinating. However, to your dog, this can signal the end of ‘fun time’ outside. It may not fully urinate to prolong the fun time, then urinate once it’s back inside. Rather than going right back inside, have extra outdoor playtime or continue the walk even after your dog’s finished urinating.If the weather is bad, don’t feel obligated to spend extra time outside. Your dog will probably want to go back inside as much as you do.

Keep the leash in an accessible location.,
Have him hold the leash.,
Walk away.,
Slowly increase the distance.",How to Teach a Dog to Tell You when He Wants to Go Outside2," If you want to teach your dog to bring you his leash when he wants to go out, you'll need to start keeping it somewhere where he can easily reach it.A location next to the door is ideal. Try putting it in a basket for easy access.

, To get started with this training, pick up the leash and give it to your dog before you let him outside, waiting a few seconds while he holds it. Then reward him with a treat and let him out. Repeat this until your dog seems eager to hold the leash for you.If your dog drops the leash, put it back in his mouth and repeat until he holds it for a few seconds.

, Once your dog has become accustomed to holding the leash in his mouth while you are both next to the door, it's time to move on to the next level of training. After you give him the leash to hold, start slowly walking away. Stand a few feet away from him and encourage him to come to you with the leash, rewarding him with a treat when he does. Repeat this until your dog seems comfortable with the routine.When your dog gets used to this, he may start following you with the leash without you having to call him to you.

, As training progresses, you should be able to walk further and further away from your dog until eventually he will bring you his leash all on his own, without any help from you.This method may not be effective for dogs who do not enjoy playing fetch.
Be sure to respond to him when he brings you his leash by taking him outside right away. Continue using treats to reinforce the behavior for a while.

Teach your dog to bark on command.,
Have your dog speak at the door.,
Be consistent.",How to Teach a Dog to Tell You when He Wants to Go Outside3," Before you can train your dog to bark when he wants to go outside, you will need to teach him to bark on command or ""speak."" This is a relatively easy trick to teach your dog, although you may want to avoid if your dog already barks a lot.To start, get your dog excited by waving a favorite toy around, making a noise, or doing anything else to get him to bark.
When he barks, reward him with a treat. Try to only reward a single bark, as you do not want to encourage him to keep barking.
Once you are able to get your dog to bark consistently with this method, add a hand signal or verbal command and use it consistently until the dog learns to bark when this command is given.
Continue to practice and reinforce the behavior by giving your dog a treat when he speaks on command.
Do not reward the dog for barking unless you specifically ask him to do it.

, Once your dog is able to speak on command, you can move on to teaching him to bark as a signal to go outside. Start by going to the door and asking your dog to speak. When he does, immediately let him out.As with the other training methods, if going outside is not enough of a reward for your dog, reward him with a treat as you let him out.

, The more consistent you are with this training, the faster your dog will learn. Have him bark each and every time you go outside, and before long, he will learn that he can ask you to go outside by repeating that behavior."

Notice frequent barking.,
Recognize an affinity for sniffing.,
Note if the dog is difficult to train.",How to Identify a Beagle2," Beagles have a loud and persistent bark. Because beagles are hounds, they are vocal dogs that tend to howl when they are playing or approached by strangers. Although persistent barking can be trained out of a beagle, they will generally still get vocal when excited., Like other hounds, beagles have excellent noses and love to sniff things. If you are going for a walk, a beagle will be constantly sniffing its surroundings. When encountering new people, one of the first things that beagle will do is sniff the newcomers to familiarize itself with their scent., Beagles have a reputation as smart but difficult dogs. This means that they can be hard to train. Beagle puppies tend to have more issues with house training and training, in general, can be more difficult in comparison to other breeds."

Certain applications, like Fetch!, can tell you what breeds your dog most closely resembles. Although it is not a perfect indicator of breed, an app might point you in the right direction.If you are curious about the breed of someone else’s dog, be sure to ask their permission before taking a picture of their dog.

, If you encounter a dog with its owner and believe that it might be a beagle, stop and inquire about the dog’s breed. Smile and, in a polite and friendly tone, ask the owner about the dog. They will likely have an idea of their dog’s breed.


You can also ask another beagle owner if they think your dog is a beagle.

, If you are unsure about your dog’s breed, ask your veterinarian. They are familiar with most dog breeds and should able to identify your dog after an examination of its physical characteristics. If they are unable to identify your dog’s lineage, they can direct you to a specialist who can.

, If you are buying a beagle from a breeder, make sure that they provide you with the paperwork to show that the American Kennel Club recognizes both parents as beagles. Without proper documentation, you may be purchasing a pet that is not a purebred beagle. In addition, a breeder might be able to help you identify whether or not your dog is a beagle, even if you did not purchase the dog from them.When purchasing a beagle from a breeder, say things like “Can I see the puppy's paperwork?” and “Can I see your credentials?”

, If you want a more conclusive detailing of your dog’s background, purchase a commercial DNA testing kit. These can be easily found online. Once you receive the kit, simply swab your dog’s mouth and mail the sample back to the company for testing. In a few weeks, you will get a set of results that indicate your dog’s heritage."

Figure out when your dog usually eliminates.,
Create a command.,
Use positive reinforcement.,
Avoid punishment.,
Clean up accidents.",How to Take a Dog Out to Poop2," To potty train a dog, keep track of when your dog usually uses the bathroom. Most dogs eliminate shortly after dinnertime. Track your dog's bathroom habits for about a week. Then, try to schedule letting your dog out around the time he usually has to eliminate., You can actually train your dog to eliminate on command. Create a command that you will use to signal to your dog it's time to go. Something like, ""Go potty"" should be sufficient. Say this command when you notice your dog squatting or sniffing as this means he will probably eliminate soon., Dogs tend to respond best to positive reinforcement. Always praise your dog when he eliminates outside.


Say something like ""Good boy"" immediately after your dog eliminates. Then, pet him a bit to show him he's done well.Some dogs respond well to a reward like a small treat. Consider taking a small bag of treats with you when you let your dog out. Give your dog a treat as a reward as soon as he eliminates., Dogs do not respond well to punishment. Scolding your dog after he's eliminated inside or confining him to his crate as punishment will not help. It will only create a stressful situation for the dog that might make accidents more frequent. If you catch your dog in the act, clap your hands fast and say ""No!"" and then take him outside. However, never punish a dog after an accident has occurred. Dogs live in the immediate moment as they might be confused as to why they're in trouble., If your dog does have an accident indoors, clean up the area thoroughly. Dogs tend to be attracted to spots where they've previously eliminated. Accidents might reoccur if you do not clean an area after an accident.


Look for special cleaners designed to remove pet urine and feces. However, urine especially can be difficult to get out of carpet. You may have to hire a carpet cleaner."
"
Do not rub your dog’s face in the urine.,
Discipline your dog in the moment.,
Remove the scent of urine.",How to Stop a Dog from Urinating Inside After Going Outside2," It may take a while for your dog to stop urinating inside after going outside. If you continue to see urine puddles in your home, do not punish your dog by rubbing its face in the urine. Not only is that form of discipline ineffective, but it will make your dog fearful of you.Your dog may think the problem is urinating in front of you, not urinating inside. Therefore, it may find secret places to urinate., Do not discipline your dog for urinating inside if you didn’t catch it in the act. If you try to discipline after the fact, your dog will not know what it’s being punished for. If you’re lucky enough to catch your dog in the act, firmly say ‘No!’ to your dog and immediately take it back outside. Praise your dog when it finishes urinating outside.Do not yell or shout at your dog.

, If your dog smells its urine in the house, it will go back to that spot and urinate. To completely remove the urine scent, use a pet-specific enzymatic cleaner that will break down the ammonia in the urine. Standard household cleaners will not get rid of the urine scent.Ammonia gives urine a very strong scent.
Keep your dog out of the area until after you clean the urine spot and the spot is fully dry.

Make a loud noise.,
Ignore the behavior.,
Put your dog in ""time out."",
Keep your dog on a leash.,
Redirect your dog's energy.,
Block your dog from the temptation.",How to Stop a Dog from Humping1," Say “NO” in a strong and loud voice or another loud noise. Dogs often get into a trance as they hump, but a loud noise might be enough to startle your dog out of that trance.Your tone should be assertive, but you need to keep anger out of it since anger can heighten a dog's energy instead of lowering it.
Try using another source of noise, like a whistle or air horn. Make sure that these noise makers are far enough away from your dog to prevent damage to the ears.
Make the noise when the dog is starting or in the middle of doing the behavior, not afterward.;
, Dogs sometimes mount people to get attention. Push the dog away or turn away from the dog so they don't get attention. You may also sit down or move away from the dog so they can’t mount you.To push the dog away, gently take the dog by its front legs and set those paws back on the ground.
Move yourself. Turning away from the dog or walking a few paces in another direction can work well as long as you remain calm.

, You may need to physically remove your dog from the area if they won’t stop humping. Say “No!” or “Nope!” when the dog humps. Then, lead the dog out of the room and into a quiet, closed room for a few minutes. Let the dog stay in that room alone for a few minutes until they calm down.When you take your dog to a ""time out"" area, make sure that there are no toys to play with.
Leave the dog for 30 seconds to three minutes.
Make sure that your dog is calm before releasing them, and when you release them, stay calm and act as though nothing happened.

, When humping is a persistent behavior, you will likely need to work with your dog every time another person or dog visits your house. Put a short leash on your dog and let them wear it around the house. When the dog needs to go to time out or you have company, you can direct your dog as needed. The leash can also help you remove the dog from aggressive situations.You could either use a tab or a drag-line. A tab is a short piece of leash measuring 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15.25 cm). A drag-line is a 4 to 6 foot (1.2 to 1.8 m) nylon cord.

, After you get your dog to stop its initial humping, redirect that energy into an acceptable behavior, like playing fetch or other games or activities.Aside from toys, you could also distract and redirect your dog by giving him or her an interactive toy that dispenses treats or by asking your dog to perform a previously learned trick.

, When you break your dog away from another dog or person it's been humping, you need to keep your dog away. If your dog moves back toward the target while displaying dominant behavior, put yourself in between your dog and the target to physically block your dog from returning.Dominant behavior may include growling or aggression, nudging, pawing, standing over another dog, or taking things away from the other dog.Stay calm as you step in front of your dog. If possible, consider leaning forward or gently knocking your dog with your hip or knee to send a message. Remember that the purpose is not to hurt your dog, but to snap it out of its fixation and let it know that you are taking command of the situation.

Be consistent.",How to Set Ground Rules for Your Dog1," It’s critical that your dog understands that you are in charge and learns to respect and trust your position in the household. Whether you think of yourself as the “alpha” or the “pack leader,” it’s important to establish your authority over your dog., A good way to establish your authority is to make your dog walk beside or behind you while on a leash. Do not allow your dog to walk in front of you, or pull on their leash. Giving your dog the upper hand while on a leash will send a message to your pooch that they are in control, which is the opposite of what you need to communicate to your dog.Try walking your dog on a leash in your backyard, and give them a treat when they walk beside or behind you.
If your dog refuses to walk beside or behind you, or pulls on the leash, stop and make your dog sit. Then say, “let’s go,” and try again.

, Feed your dog at established times and avoid giving them scraps while at the table. Having control over what your dog eats, and when they eat, is an important part of establishing your authority. You should feed your dog at regular, established mealtimes in the same area.You should not give your dog scraps while you are at the table, as this will teach your dog that begging will be rewarded.

, Whether you intend to give your dog a toy, take them for a walk, or feed them a treat, it’s important that you first make your dog sit to establish your authority. This will help the dog understand that you are in control of the situation, reward, or activity.For example, make your dog sit before playing with a toy or going for a walk.
Once your dog is sitting calmly, you can then give them a toy or take them out on a walk.

, One of the most important parts of setting ground rules for your dog is being consistent. Once you set a rule, you must make your dog follow it at all times with no exceptions. This will help establish your dominance over your dog and help the dog learn the rule.

Remove any items that have rolled under furniture.,
Keep decorations off the floor around holidays.,
Protect electrical cables.,
Keep toys off the floor.,
Remove laundry from the floor.,
Buy pet-safe houseplants.,
Keep small items kept in plastic bags away from dogs.,
Remove all string-like materials.",How to Protect Your Dog from Household Hazards1," One good way to help protect your dog is to look for any potentially hazardous items underneath the furniture. Look under sofas, chairs, beds, and tables - any place where your dog can squeeze under and find something to eat or chew on. Remove any items you find under the furniture.Remember, anything your dog can see and get to, he is liable to chew. Look for children's toys, electrical cables, magazines, cleaning products, e-cigarettes, chocolate, small objects, and anything else that could harm your dog if chewed.;
, If you decorate your house for different holidays, some of your decorations can get on the floor, which can then be eaten by your dog. Keep an eye on the floor to make sure nothing gets knocked off or dropped. Place all decorations high enough or away from edges so your dog can't grab them with his teeth to pull them down. You may also want to choose decorations that will be pet-friendly if they do end up on the floor.For example, you may want to avoid glass ornaments, which if broken, would cut paws. You can instead decorate with pet friendly plastic ornaments. You may also want to avoid tinsel or foil icicles, which could be swallowed and cause a bowel problem.

, Dogs love to chew, and few things are more tempting than the squishy texture of the insulation around electrical cables. However, the dog risks burns and electrocution if his teeth chomp down to the cable.Make all electrical wiring inaccessible by either locating it behind heavy pieces of furniture, tunneling it under carpet, or using electrical ducting.
You can also place all cords in protective plastic tubes. However, your dog may still be able to chew through this.

, Kids love to leave their toys lying around the house. A dog sees your kids' toys as a dog toy. This means your dog may take any toy on the floor and start chewing on it. A dog will chew on the toys, and if he swallows a piece of plastic, it this will cause a bowel obstruction. Small parts of toys might also cause choking.
This is great excuse to get the kids to tidy up their toys.

, Put all laundry in covered baskets or baskets tall enough that your dog can't get into it. Dogs love to grab clothes they find on the floor to hide, and then chew on. Socks and underwear are favorite objects for larger dogs to swallow, which puts your dog at the risk of a bowel obstruction.


Clothing can cause choking hazards for some dogs.
You also may end up with some of your favorite clothes ruined from your dog eating them.

, It's nice to bring greenery into the home, but if you want to bring houseplants into your home where you have a dog, do some research first. Check out each of your plants to make sure they are pet safe and not toxic to dogs.For example, common plants such as elephant ear, dieffenbachia, and spider plants are all potentially toxic if enough is eaten by a dog.
If you must keep a toxic house plant, use a hanging basket or place on a table or shelf that is kept well out of the dog's reach.

, If you put small items away in plastic bags, or keep things in a junk drawer, make sure not to let these things get on the floor where your dog can get to them. You should also refrain from leaving them lying around on low-sitting tables that are at dog height.Batteries, coins, and plastic bags are all hazards to dogs. A swallowed battery can cause serious stomach ulcers. Coins can form obstructions in the bowels, and coins containing zinc are toxic. Plastic bags can cause a bowel blockage or suffocation.
Half of the battle is to be aware and then put these objects away out of harm's reach into a sealed container, a drawer, or high up out of reach.

, Dogs love to play with long stringy things, but if swallowed they can get stuck in the bowel and cause serious life threatening problems. Stringy items include string, yarn, twist ties, and dental floss.Don't leave stringy materials within reach of the dog. Be careful in the bathroom not to leave floss in the trashcan where your dog can reach it or let it accidentally get on the floor.

Keep your Shih Tzu in a crate.,
Maintain a regular feeding schedule.,
Watch for signs your Shih Tzu needs to go out.,
Let your Shih Tzu out around the same times each day.,
Designate a potty spot, if possible.",How to Potty Train a Shih Tzu1," Until your Shih Tzu is fully potty trained, you should leave her in a crate when you're not able to supervise her. When you're out at work or school, or when you're sleeping, keep your Shih Tzu in a crate.


Choose a crate big enough for your Shih Tzu to comfortably stand and turn around in. You can make your Shih Tzu's crate more comfortable by putting toys, bedding, and water in the crate.
Crate training plays on a dog's natural instincts. In the wild, dogs sleep in dens. Your dog may actually enjoy being in her crate. Keep the crate out and open during the day, allowing your dog to go in and out of the crate as she chooses. This will make your dog more willing to enter the crate when you need to put her away.The crate is a tool for potty training, but it should not be used as a form of punishment. A dog is unlikely to soil her crate as she sees it as part of her home and territory. Therefore, you can use the crate to keep your dog from eliminating in the house.;
, If you keep your Shih Tzu on a regular feeding schedule, she's more likely to use the bathroom at regular times. Try to feed your Shih Tzu around the same times each day. Your Shih Tzu will usually need to go out about half an hour after feeding.


While a schedule is important, you should not withhold water from your dog to prevent her from urinating overnight. Limiting your dog's access to water can be unhealthy; dogs should be provided with fresh water at all times., When first potty training your Shih Tzu, it's best to take her out when it looks like she's about to use the bathroom. This will teach her to associate going outside with relieving herself. If you see your Shih Tzu squatting or sniffing, take her outside before she eliminates in the house.If you're potty training a puppy, keep in mind young dogs need to go out more often. Your Shih Tzu will need to use the bathroom about every 2 hours when she's young. Be vigilant and keep a close eye on your Shih Tzu when she's a puppy.Puppies, much like babies, have little control over accidents. Therefore, vigilance is important. Accidents are inevitable with young dogs, but you can lessen their frequency by taking the dog out every couple of hours., Having a fixed walking schedule can help train your Shih Tzu to eliminate outside. Your Shih Tzu will learn when she can be expected to be let out. This may make it easier for her to wait instead of eliminating inside.As stated, with a young dog you'll have to schedule a walk every two hours. Once you start to notice you're Shih Tzu eliminating less, you can space out the time between walks.You should always let your Shih Tzu out in the morning, shortly after feeding your dog. Make sure to let the dog out just before going to bed as well. This will lessen the likelihood of overnight accidents.

, If possible, designating a potty spot in your hard can help with training. Your Shih Tzu will recognize the smell of urine and feces, encouraging her to eliminate again. You can, for example, always have your Shih Tzu eliminate in the corner of your yard. This can help potty training go more smoothly.If you do not have a backyard, having a potty spot can be more difficult. However, you may find there's a particular patch of grass your Shih Tzu goes for on walks. You could try walking your Shih Tzu near this patch of grass to encourage elimination.
If you can't designate a potty spot, do not worry too much. While a designated potty spot can be helpful for a Shih Tzu, it is only one component of training. A regular feeding and walking schedule, as well as positive reinforcement, are also effective means of potty training a Shih Tzu.

Be patient.",How to Potty Train a Dachshund," Keep it small but not too small. Your dachshund should be able to stand comfortably and turn around. However, you don't want a crate that is too big, as that leaves space for the dog to go to the bathroom.A crate is the best way to train your dachshund. Most dogs, including dachshunds, don't like going to the bathroom where they sleep. Therefore, if you keep your dachshund in a small space while you're training her, hopefully she won't go in the same area.If you don't want to buy a special crate, you can block off a small space for your dog in a small room using baby gates.;
, That is, place it in area where there is activity. Put something soft down inside, such as a blanket or pillow. You may even need to take off the door. Your dog may naturally go inside to sleep.Add a toy that your dachshund likes to encourage her to go inside., Lead her to the crate with treats, and then put some all the way inside, inviting her in., Place her food bowl all the way in the back with her food. If she won't enter, move it closer to the front to acclimate her to the crate., If your dog goes inside to eat, close the door gently behind her. Don't shove her in the crate. When she finishes her dinner, open the door again. Slowly increase the time you let her stay in the crate., Choose a verbal cue, such as ""Go to bed."" Say the cue, and throw a treat into the crate while your dachshund is watching. If she goes inside, give her verbal praise to let her know she did a good job. You can provide another treat if you wish. Let her know it's fine to come out again by saying ""Come"" or ""Okay."" , When you are first training her, don't leave the house when you crate her. At first, stay with her in the room. Next, go to another place in the house, and try not to make too much noise. Come back within 5 to 10 minutes., If your dog can stay in the crate for 30 minutes or so without you in the same room and without whining, try putting her in the crate at night. You can also leave the house for limited amounts of time after placing the dog in the crate., When you are not home or you can't supervise your dachshund, keep her the crate. That way, she won't be tempted to urinate when you're not watching., Your dog is still learning to keep his bathroom habits under control. You'll need to take her out at least every 4 hours.Very young dogs should not be kept in the crate for even 4 hours. For instance, dogs that are 2 months old and under should only be kept in a crate for up to an hour, while 2-3 month old dogs can start moving up to 1 to 3 hours. By the time your puppy is about 4 months, she should be able to stay in the crate for up to 4 hours., If your dog is vomiting or has diarrhea, you shouldn't crate your dog. She'll likely end up using the bathroom in the crate and have to stay in her own vomit or feces. You should take her to a vet if it persists., Your dachshund will likely provide signals that she needs to use the bathroom, such as suddenly getting excited or racing around the house., The best way to teach your dachshund to go outside is to provide the opportunity. Take her out a leash. Always take her to the same spot, so she associates it with going to the bathroom. Try to take your dog out every 1 to 2 hours.You will need to take very young puppies outside more often, maybe as regularly as 20 minutes.

, Pick a phrase for bathroom time, such as ""potty time."" Use it when you are taking your dachshund outside, as well as when she goes to the bathroom so that she will associate the phrase with going outside to urinate or defecate., When your dachshund does use the bathroom outside, praise her up and down. Also provide a tangible reward--a treat. Feed her one when she's done using the bathroom., If you catch your dachshund in the process of using the bathroom inside, startle her a bit with an ""uh-oh"" or slightly sharp noise. That should stop the process. Take her outside to her bathroom spot to finish. If she goes outside, provide a treat.Clean up the spot thoroughly. Use a cleaner specifically for pet messes, as they are designed to break down the smell. If your dachshund can smell it, she may return to the same spot., Punishments will likely just make the dachshund afraid of you, meaning she won't go around you but she may do so when you're not around. In addition, if you don't catch the dog in the act, she's not likely to associate your anger with going to the bathroom in the house., Dachshunds in particular take a little longer to train than other dogs. Make sure you continue to train your dog so she can be as potty trained as possible."

Research potential causes of indoor urination.,
Have your vet examine your dog.,
Treat the medical condition, if necessary.",How to Stop a Dog from Urinating Inside After Going Outside3," Your dog isn't urinating inside to be spiteful.Rather, your dog could have a medical issue, such as diabetes, that causes it to urinate frequently due to increased water intake.Your dog probably knows it should urinate outside, but it may still need to go after coming back inside.


Puppies will urinate inside after going outside for several reasons, including weak bladder muscles and not fully understanding where they should and shouldn’t urinate.

, If your dog continues to urinate inside after going outside, take it to your vet. Your vet will examine your dog and perform diagnostic tests (blood work, urinalysis) to determine if there’s a medical reason for the inappropriate urination. Knowing why your dog is urinating inside will help guide the plan to stop the behavior., If your dog has a medical reason for urinating inside, treating the condition will help stop the behavior. For example, your vet can recommend a treatment plan for diabetes or kidney disease. Medications are also available for strengthening weak bladder muscles in dogs.

Exercise your dog.,
Avoid encouraging the behavior in any context.,
Distract your dog before it starts.,
Train your dog to leave other dogs alone.,
Teach your dog an acceptable behavior.,
Keep your dog away from excessively stressful situations.,
Work on standard obedience training.",How to Stop a Dog from Humping2," When a dog has too much energy, they can direct that energy toward an unwanted behavior, like humping. If you can thoroughly drain the dog's energy each day with structured exercise, you can help prevent your dog from using their energy on that behavior.Walking your dog is crucial. You can drain a lot of energy by letting your dog run around in a backyard on their own, but walking forces your dog to exercise physically and mentally.

, Some pet owners think it's cute when their dog humps something like a stuffed animal, but if you want your dog to stop humping other dogs or people, you need to stop the behavior in all forms. Encouraging or allowing the behavior in one form will create an inconsistency in your training, making it less effective.You may end up encouraging the behavior without even realizing it. For example, if you laugh or show signs of happiness whenever your dog mounts their favorite plush toy, you are indirectly praising your dog for the behavior.

, Watch your dog and observe how they act immediately before starting the mounting behavior. When you start to notice these signs, immediately distract your dog with a toy or game before it can engage in the behavior itself.Common signs that your dog may start humping include panting, licking, whining, pawing, or rubbing against something.

, If your dog humps other dogs, you may try to train them to obey your commands around other dogs. You may teach them to stay when told, come to you, or to stop.When you see your dog about to hump another dog, you can use one of your commands to interrupt the behavior. Make sure to give your dog a treat for the correct behavior.

, Some dogs will start humping for attention when guests visit. If you suspect that this might be an issue, teach your dog an acceptable trick to perform for company, like sitting or begging, and make sure that this trick earns your dog the same amount of attention.If the trick receives positive attention while the mounting receives negative attention, your dog is more likely to want to perform the trick.
Consider rewarding your dog with a treat or toy after it performs the trick to reinforce the positive behavior.

, Humping can also be a response to stress. If you notice that your dog displays this behavior when faced with a source of anxiety, avoid putting your dog in that stressful situation. If the situation is unavoidable, look for ways to make the experience less stressful.For example, petting and grooming can be a trigger for some dogs, in which case, you should limit the time spent doing these activities to a degree your dog can tolerate.
If visitors are your dog's trigger, keep the dog in a room until the initial energy and excitement of the visit calms down. Let the dog out once it and all of your visitors are calm.

, If your dog frequently humps you, they are trying to exert dominance over you. To stop this behavior, you need to let your dog know that you're the boss. Standard obedience training is a healthy and effective way to establish this.Obedience training can also help dogs focus and release their energy on something more productive and welcome than mounting.
Standard obedience training includes basic commands like “heel,” “sit,” “down,” and “stay.” The overall goal of an obedience training program is to train your dog to listen to you no matter what the command might be.

Neuter or spay your dog.,
Have your dog checked for medical conditions.,
Take your dog to an animal behaviorist.,
Ask your vet about appropriate medications.",How to Stop a Dog from Humping3," At its root, humping is a mating behavior. As a result, neutering or spaying your dog is the absolute first thing you should do before taking any other corrective measures. Moreover, you should also get your dog fixed as early in its life as possible for the greatest effect.Getting your dog fixed will almost always decrease mounting problems, especially in males.
However, this may not eliminate the problem completely. With older dogs, the habit is often ingrained. That's one reason why getting your dog spayed or neutered as a puppy is so important., Your dog’s humping behavior could be linked to an underlying medical condition that causes your dog to act that way. Some medical conditions can be serious if not treated and need proper medical attention. If you believe your dog has underlying issues, take them to the vet immediately.Possible medical conditions that could be contributing to your dog's behavior include urinary tract infections, urinary incontinence, persistent erections, and skin allergies.

, If your dog is aggressive when you try to stop them from mounting or humping, you may need to take them to see a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist or certified veterinary behaviorist. You shouldn’t try to alter your dog’s behavior if they are aggressive.If you cannot find a certified behaviorist in your area, look for a certified professional dog trainer. Just make sure that the dog trainer has experience dealing with aggression and mounting.
If your dog sinks their claws into the skin of a human it mounts, or growls when you try to remove it, this is a more serious problem and should be addressed by a certified applied animal behaviorist.

, When humping is clearly connected to stress, giving your dog an anti-anxiety medication might be enough to stop the humping and improve your dog's overall mental and physical health.Medication should only be used as a last resort, and even then, only in extreme conditions. For instance, if a dog is displaying other signs of anxiety, like obsessive licking or destructive behavior, he or she might have a serious anxiety issue that needs to be addressed.

Prevent your dog from mouthing or biting people.,
Stop your dog from destructive chewing behavior.,
Make your dog sit when the doorbell rings.,
Don’t allow your dog to beg.,
Do not let your dog jump on people.,
Use positive reinforcement.,
Reward good behavior in a timely manner.",How to Set Ground Rules for Your Dog2," An important ground rule to set for your dog is a prohibition on biting or mouthing. If your dog tries to chew on your hands, try substituting a chew toy. You should also encourage your dog to play in ways that do not involve contact, such as fetch or tug-of-war.If your dog does bite or mouth you, try giving a high-pitched yelp and then ignoring your dog for sixty seconds.

, It's important that you curb any destructive chewing your dog engages in. For starters, you should make sure all items that might be appealing for your dog to chew on, such as shoes, are in places that are out of your dog's reach. You can also purchase a bad-tasting repellent or spray at the pet store to use on furniture or other items. These specially formulated sprays are not toxic to dogs but the taste will deter your pet from chewing.When you leave the house, either crate your dog or make sure they have a chew toy to gnaw on during your absence.

, Some dogs have a bad habit of rushing to the door when a visitor knocks or rings the bell, and many will jump on your guests once the door is open. Teach your dog to sit and stay when they hear the sound of a doorbell or knock. This will help your dog learn that guests are only to be greeted after the successful execution of a command and permission from you.When the doorbell rings, make your dog sit. Do not open the door until your dog is sitting.

, Dogs are great at begging, using their adorable faces and sad eyes to convince you that getting on the bed or nabbing a bite of your pizza is a great idea. It is important that your dog understands that begging will not be rewarded. If your dog begs for food, try establishing a place away from the table where they are required to be during meals.At mealtimes, make your dog go to a designated area such as their crate or bed.
Try rewarding your dog with a dog treat at the end of meals if they remain in their established space.

, An important ground rule to establish with your dog is the prohibition of jumping. While jumping up is a common way for dogs, especially puppies, to greet people, it’s critical that you stop this behavior in your pet. When you come home from work, do not give your dog any attention until they sit and stay. If they jump on you, continue ignoring them until they follow your commands. Then reward them with attention by petting them or giving them a treat., Once you establish your authority and set the ground rules, it’s important that you use positive reinforcement as you teach your dog the ropes. Positive reinforcement can come in many forms, such as extra attention, a walk, or a treat when your dog does a good job following the ground rules.

, When your dog does something good, such as responding positively to a command, be sure to reward them quickly. For example, if your dog sits and stays while the doorbell rings and a guest enters your home, reward them immediately with a treat. If you wait until five minutes after the good behavior, your dog will not associate following a ground rule with a treat."

Create a comfortable space for your dog.,
Use doors and gates to establish your dog’s indoor territory.,
Establish furniture rules.",How to Set Ground Rules for Your Dog3," It's important that your dog has a space that is all their own within your house. If you decide to crate your dog, the crate can become this safe space. If you do not crate your dog, make sure they have a bed in a designated area of the house., It is important that your dog understands what parts of the house are open to dogs, and what parts are off limits. Use child or pet gates to block off areas you do not wish your dog to visit. You can also close doors to rooms that are not part of your four-legged friend’s territory., As a dog owner, you have multiple options when it comes to rules regarding furniture. You can teach your dog to completely stay off the furniture, institute an invitation-only policy, or allow the dog to sprawl out on the couch whenever they feel the urge.If you want your dog to stay off the furniture completely or to enforce an invitation-only policy, try placing a barrier on the furniture to prevent them from getting onto it, like boxes or upside down chairs.

Use child locks on cabinets.,
Store cleaning products in a safe place.,
Keep all food away from your dog.,
Secure all food scraps.,
Make sure all medications are out of your dog's reach.,
Keep all cosmetics out of reach.",How to Protect Your Dog from Household Hazards2," Kitchens and bathrooms hold numerous dangerous objects that a dog can get into. To prevent an inquisitive dog from opening cabinets to gain access to dangerous substances, fit low cabinets with child locks.


These locks will keep cabinets closed despite your dog using his paw or nose to pull the cabinet open.

, Cleaning products pose a huge danger to a dog. All cleaning problems should be stored safely away so a dog cannot even get near the bottle. A dog's teeth may pierce the plastic container, so do not assume because the product is in a childproof container it is safe.Most cleaning products can cause skin irritation, mouth ulcers, and are toxic when swallowed. The kitchen cabinet containing cleaning products should definitely have a child lock on it.

, Many foods that are safe for people are harmful to dogs. Don't assume that if it is safe for you to eat that it will be okay if your dog gets into it. Never lead food out unattended where you dog could come and eat it.When it comes to food avoid putting temptation in the dog's way and don't leave food out on the counter top.
Typical toxic foods include raisins and grapes, chocolate, avocado, onions, garlic, salt, alcohol, caffeine, and tea.
Also be aware that the artificial sweetener xylitol is extremely dangerous to dogs, so be doubly vigilant with low-sugar cookies and candies.

, Dogs love to dig in the garbage. However, this can be very dangerous for your dog. Spoiled food could contain food poisoning bacteria. Bone scraps, such as chicken bones, can damage the gut or get stuck in the throat. Use garbage cans with a screw lid to avoid clever dogs working out how to get the lid off. Make sure to secure any garbage you leave outdoors for pickup as well.

, People are larger in size than dogs, which means that the strength of human medicines are too strong for dogs. Medications not meant for dogs can be dangerous and potentially life-threatening if your dog ingests them. Keep all medicines in places where your dog can't get to them. Make sure to keep all pain relievers, anti-depressants, cold and flu remedies, diet pills, and vitamin supplements away from your dog.
If your dog gets a bottle of medicine, he will more than likely eat the whole bottle, which could prove deadly.

, Cosmetics can make your dog very ill. When ingested, these are all liable to cause stomach upsets and may be toxic. All cosmetics should be kept away from dogs. Place them in cabinets or on shelves out of your dog's reach.Cosmetics include soaps, toothpastes, sunscreen, make up, shampoo, and other similar items.
Remember, the plastic bottles these items come in are easy for a dog to pierce with his teeth.

Be careful when using antifreeze.,
Protect your dog from pest-killing products.,
Store plants and bulbs out of your dog's reach.,
Use pet-friend patio cleaner.",How to Protect Your Dog from Household Hazards3," When changing the antifreeze in your vehicle, be very careful. Don't let any antifreeze drain onto the road because it has a sweet taste and it could be licked by passing pets. If drank, antifreeze containing ethylene glycol causes kidney failure and death.Store antifreeze in the garage on a high shelf in the original container, well out of reach.

, Even if you have a dog, you may use rodenticides, pesticides, or slug bait to get rid of annoying pests around your home. Make sure to take measures to protect your dog from these items when you use and store them.Rodents are mammals just like dogs. Rodenticides are harmful to dogs as well as rodents. If you place rodenticides out to kill rodents, make sure to place them in places where your dog cannot get into them, because it could be potentially fatal. Be sure to keep rodenticides in a sealed container on a high shelf when not being used.
Read the instructions for pesticides or herbicides carefully. Some may leave a residue on plants that is harmful to dogs even when dry. Avoid using products that are harmful to dogs. Instead, choose pet-friendly products. For products that are pet safe, be sure they are totally dry before the dog comes into contact with them.
When using slug bait, always read the label and make sure the product you are using is pet safe. Consider using alternative methods of slug and snail control, such as nematodes.

, Many common garden plants, and especially spring bulbs, are toxic and cause irritation of the gut if chewed and swallowed by dogs. If your dog likes to dig up plants and bulbs, put a fence or barrier around your garden or choose pet-friendly bulbs just in case. Carefully research all the plants in your garden to check they are safe for your dog before planting.For example, rhododendrons, azaleas, and tulip bulbs contain a substance which can cause sickness and diarrhea, coma, or even death.

, May patio cleaners contain caustic chemicals which can cause skin burns. If the dog walks across a wet patio and then washes his paws with his tongue, he could sustain damage not only to the paws, but also to his mouth, tongue, and esophagus. Always let the patio dry completely and then be washed clean by rain before letting the dog on it.


Alternatively, consider using a pressure washer to remove any leftover cleaner.

Consider how to reward your Shih Tzu.,
Reward immediately.,
Think of a command.,
Scold in the immediate moment.",How to Potty Train a Shih Tzu2," Some owners find rewarding their dogs for eliminating outside is helpful. Shih Tzus are people-friendly animals who tend to want to please their owners. Offering a reward when your Shih Tzu eliminates outside can help encourage the behavior.


Praise and treats are the main forms of rewards you can use. You can carry a small bag of treats with you and offer your dog a treat when she goes outside. You can also praise the dog after she eliminates outside. Say something like, ""Good girl!"" and then pet your Shih Tzu.You may want to use treats at first, when your Shih Tzu is first learning. However, many owners wean their Shih Tzus off treats as they get accustom to a new bathroom schedule. You may not want your Shih Tzu to always expect a treat for basic behavior. Consider tapering off the treats as your Shih Tzus begins to learn to go to the bathroom outside., Dogs live in the immediate. Reward your Shih Tzu as soon as she eliminates outside. Say ""Good girl!"" or give your Shih Tzu a treat as soon as she finishes urinating or defecating. Be consistent. Make sure to reward every time your Shih Tzu engages in the desired behavior., It can sometimes be helpful to have a command to give your Shih Tzu. Something like, ""Go potty!"" can be helpful. You can use this to remind your Shih Tzu she should use the bathroom when outside, further reinforcing the desired behavior.Say ""Go potty!"" when you know your Shih Tzu is about to eliminate. If you see her squatting or sniffing, for example, say, ""Go potty!""
Eventually, your Shih Tzu will learn ""Go potty!"" means she should use the bathroom. If your Shih Tzu is dawdling on a walk, saying ""Go potty!"" may encourage her to eliminate.

, In the event you catch your Shih Tzu eliminating indoors, scold in the immediate moment. Give a firm ""No!"" as you clap your hands. Then, immediately take your Shih Tzu outdoors to eliminate. As stated, dogs live in the immediate. If you don't scold your Shih Tzu in the moment an accident is happening, the dog will not understand why she is being scolded."

Do not punish a Shih Tzu.,
Clean accidents thoroughly.,
Have patience.",How to Potty Train a Shih Tzu3," Shih Tzus do not respond well to punishment. If you see your Shih Tzu has had an accident, it is too late to scold the dog. Punishing your Shih Tzu after an accident has occurred will only serve to confuse her.Never put your dog in her crate as a form of punishment. You should never use physical violence, like hitting the dog, as a form of punishment.You should never yell at a Shih Tzu. The only form of scolding you should use is a firm ""No!"" Raising your voice can startle your dog, creating an environment of fear. This can make training more difficult., In the event of an accident, clean the affected area thoroughly. Use an odor-neutralizing spray and make sure you get out any traces of urine or feces. You want to make sure the area is clean. Shih Tzus are drawn to smell. If an area smells like urine or fecal matter, they're likely to eliminate in that area again., Shih Tzus are highly trainable dogs, but it may take a few weeks for your dog to be successfully house-trained. If you're working with an older Shih Tzu, training can take longer. However, consistent training over a long period of time will eventually pay off. Even if you are frustrated, try to have patience while you're training your Shih Tzu.

Make sure the crate is the right size.,
Feed your dog in his crate.,
Alter the bedding in the crate.,
Clean up any accidents thoroughly.",How to Prevent a Dog from Defecating in its Crate1," Oftentimes, dogs will defecate in their crate if it's too big. If the crate is large enough that your dog can comfortably poop in a corner he might choose to go in his crate rather than wait to be let out.


Your dog's crate should be just big enough for him to stand up and turn around in and lie down with his legs straight. Anything bigger might make him tempted to use the crate as a bathroom.If you have a puppy, choose a crate with his adult size in mind. Crates can get expensive and you do not want to have to keep replacing a crate, but you can block off the excess crate space with cardboard paper, styrofoam, or other puppy safe materials.;
, Chances are, your dog would prefer not to defecate in the same space where he's fed. Feeding him in the crate can help.


You do not need to close your dog in the crate at meal times, as the stress of being locked in may interfere with his ability to eat. Just set the food inside his crate and leave the door open.Your dog might be wary to enter the crate to eat at first, as he may suspect you're leaving and are trying to lure him in. If you leave the food out and go about your regular activities he should eventually eat., Changing the types of blankets you provide in the crate, or adding extra blankets, can potentially make your dog stop going in his crate.


If you don't use bedding currently, adding a nice bed or some blankets to a crate may make your dog less likely to use the crate as a bathroom. Your dog will not want to defecate in an area if he enjoys cuddling and sleeping there.Conversely, if you do currently use bedding, and your dog buries his feces under it, remove the bedding. Your dog may be less likely to defecate in his crate if he feels he cannot easily cover it up.Paper padding should not be left in a crate, especially if your dog is paper trained.

, Each time your dog defecates in his crate, clean the area thoroughly. Use an enzymatic cleaner from a pet store or grocery store. Eliminating the odor caused by elimination may make your dog less likely to choose the same spot to poop again."

Get a specialized dog trainer.,
Rule out a medical problem.,
Consider neutering or spaying your dog.,
Become the Alpha of the pack.,
Learn some techniques to help at home.",How to Tame a Dog1," Often people confuse dominant dogs with aggressive dogs. A dominant dog wants to be the leader of the pack. An aggressive dog takes it a step further and becomes threatening or physically aggressive. If your dog is aggressive, do not undertake training him by yourself. Aggressive dogs require special training. Seek the assistance of a “dog behaviorist” who specializes in dog behavior.


The trainer will work with your dog and develop a treatment plan specifically for your dog and your family’s situation.Find a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB) in your area by clicking here or for a Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Behaviorists (Dip ACVB).;
, Dogs can be aggressive because of medical conditions, such as orthopedic problems, adrenal dysfunction, sensory deficits, acute pain, thyroid abnormalities, cognitive problems, seizure disorders, etc. Take your dog to the vet to determine if one of these problems might be causing his aggressive behavior., Dogs become sexually mature between 6-12 months old. In female dogs, this produces a significant rise in the hormone estrogen and in males a surge in testosterone. These changes can create hormonally driven guarding behaviors and fighting for male attention in females. In males a dog’s instinct to mate can lead to fighting and other aggressive behaviors.


Studies are somewhat mixed on the degree to which spaying and neutering reduce aggressive behaviors, but the consensus is that, along with training, both can reduce aggression., Dogs are pack creatures and, therefore, you as the human have to become the pack leader. Pack leaders create rules, limits and boundaries to protect the pack. If a member of the pack doesn’t think the leader is consistent or strong, he or she will instinctually try to keep the pack safe by becoming its leader. This means you have to become the pack leader. You must become the teacher, friend, leader and guardian.


You should be consistent, firm and confident when correcting your dog or he will feel insecure, confused and unhappy.
As the pack leader, you don’t give affection to members of the pack when rules are broken.
And remember that negative attention is still attention and will encourage bad behaviors. For instance, you can’t say, “Don’t jump, Max!” as you pet him., While you should follow the guidance of your trainer, there are a several things you can do to help control your dog at home as he is receiving training. One of the most critical is learning to regulate your emotions and to stay calm. The following are relatively easy solutions to common problems.


If your dog has a habit of running out of the house when the door is opened, prevent access to these areas with child safety gates, fences and so forth.Crate or kennel your dog when he is more relaxed, such as after a walk, or at night when you’re unable to monitor him.
Make sure your dog gets plenty of exercise. Until your dog is trained to obey you on walks, play with him in your backyard or another enclosed, private outdoor space.
Take walks during times that others aren’t out walking in abundance, and make sure your dog wears a basket-style muzzle.Eliminate games like Tug-O-War that encourage aggressive behavior. Play non-adversarial games like fetch instead.If your dog is constantly jumping on you or demanding attention in other ways, use the “sit,” “stay” or “down” command once he knows them and then positively reward him with your attention when he complies. If that doesn’t work, step into your dog sideways when he jumps on you. Your shoulder will be to your dog. Don’t lean back as this encourages your dog’s desire to overtake your space.

Back up a few steps if your dog is struggling.,
Keep the confinement area clean.,
Make sure to use positive reinforcement.",How to Paper Train Your Small Dog," The first step to paper training is to choose an indoor potty area. The training area you choose should be where you want your dog to eliminate longterm. There are several factors to consider when selecting a location.First off, consider where you're comfortable having your dog eliminate. While the linoleum floor in the kitchen may be easier to clean in the event of an accident, do you really want your dog eliminating near where you eat? Maybe the bathroom would be a better choice.
Second, you need to confine your dog to this area during training. Choose an area in your home you can easily block off with baby gates or by closing a door. You will be slowly reducing the confinement area over time, until your dog eliminates in only a small corner of your home.;
, To start, you will need to prepare the confinement area. This is the area where your dog will be eliminating longterm. At first, give your dog a great deal of space. Line newspapers or puppy pads all around the general area where you want your dog to eliminate.Make sure to line the entire area. You may need to overlap newspaper or pads a little just to make sure there are no gaps in coverage.
Puppy pads are probably a better option than newspapers, as they're more absorbent.

, When you leave your home, leave your dog in the confinement area at all times. This way, if it needs to eliminate, it will do so in this area and not have an accident elsewhere. The dog will begin to get used to using the confinement area while you're away., When you're home, you will have to encourage your dog to use the confinement area. This means you'll need to observe your dog and watch for signs, such as squatting and sniffing, that indicate it needs to eliminate.If you see your dog is preparing to eliminate, encourage it to use the confinement area. You can lift your dog up and bring it to the confinement area. You can also call it and direct it to the confinement area.
Praise your dog when it eliminates on the newspaper or puppy pads. This will help your dog understand where it needs to eliminate.

, After a few days, take a few sheets away in the confinement area. You should remove about a third of the sheets.Progress with training as you did before. Once again, leave the dog in the reduced confinement area while you're gone. Encourage your dog to use the confinement area when you're home.

, Keep reducing the size of the confinement area by about a third each day. Remember, you want your dog to eliminate in a small corner of your house, much like a cat uses the litter box. Aim to get the confinement area down to a suitable size.How long this will take varies. It depends both on the size you're aiming for and how quick your dog learns. It can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months.
Not all dogs will progress at the same rate. If your dog seems to be struggling to eliminate on the paper after you remove some pads, put the pads back in place for a few days. Wait a few days before attempting to reduce the confinement area again.

, You want to continue to encourage your dog to use the area. As you reduce the size, keep watching your dog throughout the day. Again, if you notice your dog squatting or sniffing, direct it to the confinement area.Do not be surprised if your dog is a little confused. It may eliminate where the paper used to be and not on the new paper.
Try to get your dog to understand it needs to eliminate on the paper and not near it. Be stricter as your dog's training progresses. During the first few days, your dog eliminating near the paper can warrant praise. As time goes by, only offer praise when your dog eliminates on the paper.

, Scolding or punishing a dog aggressively will not help the training process. You should also avoid scolding your dog well after it's had an accident. Your dog will not understand why it's being punished if you do not address the behavior immediately. Think of it as correcting the behavior rather than scolding or punishing your dog.Interrupt the dog when you see it eliminating off the newspaper or padding. You can clap your hands and say something like, ""No!"" to distract your dog.
Immediately take your dog to the bathroom spot. Allow it to finish eliminating there and then offer a treat as a reward.

, Praise your dog when it uses the newspaper. You do not want to distract your dog while in the middle of the act, so wait until it's done to offer praise. Praise them using an upbeat, distinct tone of voice and say something like, ""Good job!"" You can offer treats as a reward as well., Not all dogs will benefit from paper training. It can actually have a negative impact on your dog's health, as regular walking and exercise are important for a dog's well being. In certain circumstances, however, paper training is appropriate and even preferable. If you do decide on paper training, make sure to play with your dog a lot indoors. Smaller dogs are easier to exercise without going outside.If you are unable to let your dog outside due to medical reasons, paper training is a good option.
If you have a full-time job that prevents you from letting your dog out during the day, paper training is a good idea. You don't want to confine your dog to a crate during the daytime.
If you live in an area with bad winters, you may want to paper train your dog at least during the colder months.

, It's normal for dogs to stumble over a few steps when paper training. If your dog seems to be struggling at a certain point, back up a few steps. If your dog starts having accidents after you reduce the size of a confinement area, restore the area to its original size. Wait a few days before reducing the size again.All dogs will progress at different rates. Your dog may pick up paper training in a few weeks. Other dogs may take a few months to learn.

, You wouldn't want to use a toilet that's not flushed, so don't make your dog use dirty paper. Once it's been soiled, replace it right away. Otherwise, you dog may pee in other areas in the home. You should clean the newspaper about once a week., It's important your dog understands when it's behaving properly. Make sure to reward your dog for eliminating on the paper towels.You can praise the dog using your voice. Say something like, ""Good boy!"" You can also offer a small treat. Just make sure not to give your dog too many treats per day. Try breaking up bigger treats into small, bite-sized portions.
Always reward in the immediate moment. This is the only way to get your dog to understand why it's being rewarded. However, make sure you wait until the dog's done eliminating. It may get distracted otherwise and stop eliminating on the paper.

Do not allow your Shih Tzu around young children.",How to Train Your Shih Tzu," Crate training is not only important to the process of housebreaking. Having your Shih Tzu familiar with her crate can help with vet trips, road trips, and other incidents where your Shih Tzu may need to be temporarily confined.


Pick a small dog crate for your shih tzu. You only need enough room for your Shih Tzu to sit, stand, and turn around.Crates should also have ventilation on all four sides. It's not a bad idea to keep the crate somewhere in your home where you hang out frequently. That way, your Shih Tzu can occasionally go in her crate while still feeling like part of the family.Going in the crate should be thought of as a treat rather than a punishment. Keep a water dish, food, toys, and treats in the crate. Make sure any toys and dog safe and big enough that your Shih Tzu will not swallow them.Keep your Shih Tzu in the crate when you sleep, go out, or when you're occupied with a household chore that prevents you from watching her. Do this until your Shih Tzu is housebroken and you know she will not have accidents indoors.It is important not to treat the crate as a ""cage"" or ""prison"" and to keep use to a minimum. If necessary, when you are home keep the dog on a lead so you can keep an eye on him and take him outside to toilet as soon as you spot signs of him wanting to toilet.;
, While most owners prefer their pets eliminate outside, as Shih Tzus are smaller pets many apartment dwellers own them. If you don't have easy access to the street or a yard, you may want your Shih Tzu to eliminate inside on newspaper or padding.


Paper training's main pro is convenience. For people who have difficulty taking a dog outside for whatever reason, whether a busy schedule or a physical problems, paper training can be an alternative option. In addition to padding and newspaper, dog litter boxes are sold in many pet stores.Paper training's main drawback is that it creates odor and might not be the best option for your dog. Shih Tzu are high energy and crave the outdoors.Whichever route you go with, it's important to be consistent. Shih Tzus may get confused if they're told they can sometimes use a pad but are sometimes expected to go outside. Shih Tzus need a strict schedule for training, so you'll need to pick one option or the other., When you first begin housebreaking your Shih Tzu, you'll need to stick to a strict walking schedule to make sure your pet doesn't eliminate inside.


Sniffing, circling, or squatting are signs a Shih Tzu is ready to eliminate. If you notice these behaviors, either take your dog outside immediately or direct her to the proper place in the house.When you first begin housebreaking a Shih Tzu, you'll need to take her out every one and a half to two hours or every 20-30 minutes for a puppy. You should take her out when you wake up, before you go to bed, and after she eats or drinks.Praise your Shih Tzu immediately after she eliminates outside or in the proper place in your home. Shih Tzus generally respond better to positive reinforcement than negative reinforcement, so praise for success will go farther than scolding for mistakes., Shih Tzu are notoriously difficult to house break. It may take as long as eight months before a Shih Tzu fully understands where it's appropriate to eliminate. Do not be discouraged. Even if you're still having accidents after a few months, be persistent and strict about your training schedule. Eventually, your Shih Tzu should understand and obey the rules., Shih Tzus are highly social dogs and want to be with their owners as much as possible. Separation anxiety is a problem for Shih Tzus and, as it's not possible to bring your dog everywhere, you need to train your Shih Tzu to adapt to solitude.


A crate can be an excellent way to lessen separation anxiety. Shih Tzus tend to be less nervous about being left alone if they have a place of their own to retreat to. Make your Shih Tzu's crate comfortable, with bedding and toys, and leave the crate door open when you are home. This way, the Shih Tzu will not see the crate as a forced experience but her own special refuge.Some people are wary of leaving their dogs in crates, especially if they're gone for long hours during the day. If this is the case with you, you could try allowing your Shih Tzu access to your bedroom, study, or another closed off area of the house where she feels safe., Shih Tzus might develop nervous tendencies if overly coddled. This can result in timidness and even aggression. Expose your Shih Tzu to a variety of sounds and experiences.


Sounds like whistles, lawn mowers, sirens, vacuum cleaners, washing machines, and other day-to-day noises should be familiar to your Shih Tzu. As separation anxiety is an issue, you don't want to risk her hearing an innocuous noise and panicking while you're gone. Exposing your Shih Tzu to a variety of stimuli simply means taking her with you different places and remaining calm and collected in the face of loud or sudden noises.Dogs pick up on cues from their owners. If you get frightened or anticipate a negative behavior from your dog, it's more likely to occur. Staying calm in the face of sudden noises, other dogs, or other people can help your dog stay calm. Do not treat her any differently so she sees the event is normal and not be feared. If she displays any timid behavior, such as cowering or whimpering, it's okay to say something soothing to her or to provide with a treat to make the moment seem happy and positive. However, do not remove her from the situation, pick her up, or otherwise overreact as this encourages an overreaction in the dog.
Oftentimes, owners are overprotective of small dogs, leading to what is known as ""small dog syndrome."" Owners ignore aggressive behavior, like biting, and try to protect smaller dogs from bigger animals by picking them up or panicking when they interact with larger breeds. The combination of lack of discipline and coddling means smaller dogs end up both fearful and somewhat aggressive. Allow your Shih Tzu to safely interact with bigger animals and scold her if she bites or redirect the nipping towards a toy or treat., Having your dog come when called is an extremely important behavior. Not only can this prevent accidents it also fosters a stronger relationship between you and your Shih Tzu.


Always make coming to you a positive experience. Your Shih Tzu should feel that coming when called is the best thing for her. Reward her with praise, attention, treats, and toys when she obeys.At first, it might be helpful to run away from your Shih Tzu when you call her. Dogs see running as a game and she'll find it hard to resist running after you.Start praising your Shih Tzu as soon as she responds to your commands. If she's getting praise, she'll be eager to reach you and less likely to be distracted by sounds, other animals, or other people.If your Shih Tzu does not come when called, do not repeat her name or ""come"" over and over again. This simply teaches her it's okay to ignore your commands. If she's not responding, try running or shaking a bag of treats while saying ""come"" or her name rather than repeating the command fruitlessly., As Shih Tzus are small dogs, leash training is particularly important as you don't want to cause strain on their necks or limbs during walks.


Until your Shih Tzu learns not to pull, take her for short walks only. Find alternative ways to exercise her, as walks will be training sessions until she's mastered good leash manners.Reward not puling with treats and praise. Scolding does not work well with Shih Tzus. They're more likely to respond to positive feedback, so praise her for what she's doing right instead of scolding her for what she's doing wrong.If your Shih Tzu gets worked up before a walk, she's more likely to misbehave on it. When you go to get the leash, ignore your Shih Tzu if she starts jumping around. Simply wait until she sits down and clip the leash on her collar. If she starts bouncing around when you reach to clip the leash, stand up and wait for her to calm down again. Do not clip the leash until she's done bouncing, even if it takes awhile.When your dog pulls, do not pull back. Simply stop. If she learns to associate pulling with a negative, the walk stopping, she'll eventually learn not to pull. This works much better than scolding or pulling back, which only serve to further rile up the dog.If your Shih Tzu has a lot of trouble with leash manners, consider investing in a harness until she calms down. Dog harnesses can be purchased at pet stores and will keep your Shih Tzu from straining her neck if she pulls on the leash.

, Sit and lie down are important commands as many other behaviors require your dog to sit or lie down first. They provide the foundation for solid training.


To teach your Shih Tzu to sit, at first you should stand before her and say ""sit."" Then, use a treat and draw an arc over the puppy' s head so that as his head goes up his bottom goes down. Praise her as soon as she hits the ground.As training progresses, you can swap out physically moving your dog for hand gestures. She should understand, with persistence, what the gestures mean. After awhile, try to phase out hand gestures too and get your Shih Tzu to sit when you say so. Be consistent and practice the command 10 to 15 times a day until she's mastered it.Sit is an important command for maintaining control over your Shih Tzu. You'll need her to sit when people come to the door, before you take her for walks, and in other situations where she needs to remain calm. Ideally, she should sit every time she hears the command regardless of other stimuli.Once your Shih Tzu has mastered sit, you can teach her to lie down. Start the same way you started teaching her to sit. Ask her to sit, and then use a treat to lure him into a lying position. Get him to sit then hold the treat at floor level but slowly move it away from him so that he stretches and lies down to get it. As soon as she lies down, praise her with treats and attention. Transition to hand gestures, and then the command alone.Sit and lie down can be used as foundations for other tricks, such as roll over, shake, and play dead. These tricks can all be taught using the same basic formula. Get your dog to sit or lie down, and then physically show her the needed behavior while praising her for performing. Move onto the hand gestures, and eventually vocal commands alone.

, Shih Tzus love their people, but they're not as people pleasing as other breeds. They tend to be stubborn and may not consistently follow your rules.


A Shih Tzu's mood is dynamic. She may be willing to sit and stay one day in order to get a treat, but may show no interest in the treat the next day. You can't always use the same training tactics with a Shih Tzu. You might have to switch up how you reward and punish behavior.If your Shih Tzu is ignoring food one day, try rewarding her with praise, toys, or a walk. Shih Tzus are a highly intelligent breed and expect rewards for good behavior. Have a variety of ideas on hand to reward your dog for being good., Although Shih Tzus can be notoriously difficult to train due to their stubborn streak, being firm with them without resorting to scolding or heavy discipline, is an effective means of training.


If your Shih Tzu is acting out or misbehaving, it's better to simply ignore the behavior. Do not give in to jumping, biting, or other attention grabbing behaviors. Do not make eye contact with your Shih Tzu if she misbehaves and do not speak to her or touch her. If your Shih Tzu realizes certain behaviors do not result in attention, she'll cease using them.Always praise a Shih Tzu for behaving well. Shih Tzus enjoy human interaction and affection and are willing to work for praise. Positive reinforcing good behaviors while ignoring bad ones is a great way to get your Shih Tzu to behave., Shih Tzus are great pets, but tend to be one person dogs and prefer homes with more mature family members. Children under the age of 3 might not do well with a Shih Tzu as they'll fail to understand the breed needs boundaries. If you have young children, consider opting for a different breed or keeping your kids and your dog separate."

Crate train your dog before leaving him alone in a crate.,
Keep a consistent walk schedule.,
Create a consistent daily feeding schedule.,
Use positive and negative reinforcement.",How to Prevent a Dog from Defecating in its Crate2," If you're just starting to leave your dog alone in his crate and he's eliminating in it, the problem is probably that he's not used to the crate. A dog should be introduced to his crate gradually before he can be left alone in the crate safely.


Allow your dog a few days to get used to the crate. Encourage him to enter the crate, but do not lock it. Make the crate a pleasant experience by providing your dog with treats and praise for entering the crate.Once your dog is used to the crate, you can begin closing him in it for small periods at time. Start small, only leaving him in the crate for about 10 minutes at a time, and then gradually increase the duration.Once your dog is able to spend 30 minutes in his crate without becoming anxious or afraid, you can begin leaving him for longer periods. Always be matter of fact when leaving. Dragging out a departure by saying a long goodbye to your canine can make his anxiety about being left alone worse.You can gradually increase the amount of time you leave your dog alone in the crate, eventually working up to leaving him in the crate overnight and while you're at work., If your dog is having problems with eliminating in his crate, his walk schedule might not be consistent enough. Make sure you walk your dog at regular intervals so he does not have to resort to going in his crate.


Simply leaving your dog outside will not necessarily teach him he's supposed to toilet outdoors. When potty training stay outside with him and praise him when he goes to the toilet spot. If you don't do this the risk is he may just regard outdoors as a playground, and not take the opportunity to relieve himself.
Depending on your dog's age, he'll need more or less time outside. If he's under 12 weeks, he should be let out once an hour during the day and every 3 to 4 hours during the night.As he gets older, you can gradually increase the increments of time between walks. By the time he's 6 to 7 months old, you should be letting him out about every 4 hours during the day and every 8 hours at night. An adult dog should be let out at least three times a day, and preferably get at least one longer walk during that time.Consistency is key. Try to let your dog out around the same time each day. Your dog's body will adapt to a regular schedule and that should result in less accidents., Feeding should also be done on a schedule. Limiting treats and snacks between meals can lead to less bathroom issues. Eating stimulates the bowel about 20 minutes later. Don't give the dog a meal and immediately crate him as he may then get caught short. Instead, give him a chance to toilet outside, around 20 to 30 minutes after eating.


How much food your dog needs depends on his breed, size, and any medical conditions he might have. You can talk to your vet about how much food is appropriate for your dog and then decide how to best divide up feeding times throughout the day.If you crate your dog overnight, do not give him food or water 3 hours before bed time. If you crate your dog during the day while you're at work, make sure to give him a longer walk in the morning so he has a chance to relieve himself after breakfast., The use of positive and negative reinforcement can help your dog learn not to poop in his crate.


When you take your dog outside, always praise him when he poops. You can use verbal praise, saying something like ""Good boy!"", and also carry small treats to provide a reward.If you see your dog getting ready to poop in his crate, clap your hands and say ""No."" Then, take him outside so he can do his business there.Remember, dogs live in the immediate. If you wake up in the morning and find he's gone in his crate, scolding him then is probably not helpful. He will not understand what he's being scolded over. You should also avoid overly aggressive or loud scolding, as this can lead to anxiety that could potentially make the problem worse. Never rub your dog's nose in his feces or urine, as this will only serve to upset and confuse your dog."

Make an appointment with a veterinarian.,
Familiarize yourself with the signs of separation anxiety.,
Be careful about changing your dog's diet.",How to Prevent a Dog from Defecating in its Crate3," You want to make sure you rule out any medical problems as a potential cause. Make an appointment with your veterinarian and have her perform a routine physical exam on your dog.


If your dog is experiencing loose stools or diarrhea, he may have gastrointestinal problems that warrant medical treatment. Your vet may perform blood tests or x-rays to determine treatment.Older dogs often have age-related bowel control issues. If your dog is a senior, your vet may order tests to determine if he can still control his bowels. She may have some suggestions for treatment options if this is the case., Dogs often defecate in their crate due to separation anxiety. Know the signs of separation anxiety and what to do if your dog is suffering from it.


If the defecation is combined with howling, barking, excessive pacing, and your dog has been escaping or attempting to escape from his crate he may have separation anxiety. If you've recently had a change in schedule, residence, or roommate/family situation, your dog can develop anxiety in response to this.Providing positive reinforcement, like treats and praise, during stressful situations can help combat your dog's anxiety. You can leave your dog toys or food when you leave the house, for example. Many pet stores sell puzzle toys, where your dog has to figure out how to open a contraption to get a treat or a toy as a reward. This can be a great distraction if your dog seems to develop anxiety in your absence.You can also ask your veterinarian about treatment options. She might recommend a medication or a training program that can help your dog cope., Any changes in a dog's diet can result in bowel control issues. If you've recently change food types or brands, your dog may be having trouble controlling his bowels. Always transition between food types gradually, starting off by mixing small amounts of the new type of food into the old type and gradually building your way up."

Become the pack leader.,
Bond with your dog.,
Read your dog’s body language.",How to Tame a Dog2," As with aggressive dogs, it’s critical that you assert yourself as the Alpha with dogs who are not aggressive but who have dominant or hyper tendencies. Be a strong, clear, calm and fair leader who your dog will respect and listen to. This requires praising him confidently and regularly for good behavior. It also requires asserting your leadership role calmly through being consistent in your expectations; issuing commands only once your dog knows them and you’re willing to always follow through with them; and giving and denying permission for activities like getting in the car, laying on furniture, stealing food, exiting the home, etc.

, Just as with human relationships, dog/human relationships take time to build. But the payout is significant – your dog learns to trust and respect you. He becomes a member of the family, playing his particular role just like every other person or pet in the family. If your dog trusts you and finds you interesting and fun, he will want to listen to you, make you happy and do things with you. Here are a few ways to bond with your dog.Take long walks together.
Initiate plenty of play time together.
Smile at and praise your dog.
Pet your dog a lot.
Train your dog.
Comb your dog’s hair.
Take short, fun jaunts together.

, Learning to read your dog’s body language will help a great deal in meeting his needs, in addition to anticipating and preventing problem behaviors. All dogs will have their individual signals, but there are a number of established signs that are important to know.


When you correct a dog and it sulks, leaves the room or turns its head, he’s signaling that he accepts what you’re saying. He’s acknowledging that you’re the pack leader, not him.
When a dog drops his head and shoulders to the ground from a standing position, it means he wants to play.
Licking a person or other animal is a sign of affection.
Running around and acting very excited doesn’t necessarily represent happiness. It often means that the dog needs mental and physical exercise, in addition to leadership.
A dog that wants to be the leader, or Alpha, puffs out his chest, hold his head high and tries to make himself look bigger. He wants to dominate.
Jumping on a person is a dominant action, not generally one of greeting. The dog is saying he’s the Alpha and wants to own or control the person.
When a dominant dog is baring its teeth and staring directly into the eyes of another person or animal, he’s saying he’s displeased. He’s sending a warning. It’s also a sign that he could bite.
When a dog’s tail is down and tucked, his ears are pushed back, or is leaning backward, it signals he feels insecure or scared.

Teach a Labrador Retriever his name as soon as you bring him home.,
Speak the dog's name before giving any command.,
Keep your Labrador Retriever's obedience lessons brief.,
Acclimate the Labrador to new experiences by walking him while leashed in areas where he will encounter strangers and hear new sounds.,
Make sure the Labrador Retriever is ""surface trained"" to safely escape emergency situations.",How to Train Labradors," Say the name repeatedly whenever you interact with him. The dog should recognize his name before you start teaching commands.;
,


Teach ""no"" by stating the dog's name followed by the one-word command. This is what you will say whenever you want the dog to stop doing something.
Say the dog's name followed by ""come"" when training Labrador Retrievers to heed this important command. Don't chase the dog if he darts away. Respond with a food treat or praise when the dog obeys.
Train Labradors to obey a command to ""sit"" by putting your hand across the dog's chest and the other hand across the rump. Push back and down until he is sitting.
Get a Labrador Retriever to lie down by first getting him to sit. Take a food treat in your hand, give the ""down"" command and move your hand toward the ground. If the dog doesn't obey, move your hand even lower. When the dog obeys, say ""down"" again, give him the treat and praise.
Walk the dog on a leash to teach ""heel."" You should give the ""heel"" command and quickly pull back on the leash as soon as the dog tugs on the leash. Calm the dog by making him sit for a moment before resuming the walk.

, Repeat the sessions regularly. Make the lessons fun and stress-free for both you and the dog.

, Outside malls are good locations for this part of training.

, Familiarize the dog with climbing stairs, riding elevators, and walking on different types of floors and ground cover like cement, glossy tiles, metal grates, etc. This should prevent the dog from becoming frightened and immobilized if he faces unfamiliar surfaces during an emergency.

Close the crate door.,
Keep the crate door closed in different situations.,
Do not crate your Collie for too long.,
Do not use the crate to punish your Collie.,

Maintain a consistent elimination routine.,
Watch for bathroom body language.,
Do not punish your Collie if he has an accident.,
Train your Collie to follow basic commands.,
Teach your Collie not to bark.,
Consider dog sports for your Collie.,
Discourage herding behavior.",How to Train Collies," A crate gives your Collie his own safe space in your home.When you’re looking at crates in your local pet store, select one that will be comfortable for your Collie. An ideal crate size for a Collie is 23 inches x 27 inches x 36 inches (58cm x 69cm x 91cm).This size would allow your Collie to move around comfortably, but wouldn't give him enough space to eliminate in a separate area.


Crate training is a good way to begin house training, since your Collie would learn to eliminate only outside.
A wire crate is a good choice because it would let your Collie see what’s going on around him and feel like he’s part of the family.;
, Wild dogs create dens in their environment to feel safe. Make the crate feel like a cozy den by placing a towel or blanket on top of it.Inside the crate, place a comfortable blanket or dog bed, along with some favorite toys and a water bowl. If you have a puppy, choose a spill-proof bowl so he doesn’t make a watery mess.Consider putting bumper pads on the sides of the crate to prevent your Collie’s toes from getting stuck in the open spaces. Bumper pads can also provide extra comfort for your Collie and keep him from damaging his teeth on the metal., When you first introduce your Collie to the crate, he may not simply walk in and start exploring. To encourage him to go inside, place some tasty treats near the crate, just inside the crate’s door, and near the back of the crate.He may not eat all of the treats at once; initially, he may feel comfortable eating only the treats outside the crate. Be patient with him and work at his pace until he walks all the way in the crate.


When he can enter the crate with treats, start feeding him his meals in the crate. You may need to use the same process with the food bowl that you did with the treats.
Always use a bright and cheery voice when your Collie enters the crate. This type of positive reinforcement will help your Collie learn that the inside of the crate is a good place for him to be.

, Initially, you should leave the crate door open at all times. Once your Collie can eat his meals in the crate, start closing the door behind him when he eats. At first, close the door when he’s eating and open it immediately after he’s finished. Gradually, leave the door closed for up to 15 minutes after mealtime.Your Collie may whine when you close the door. Do not give in! Wait until he stops whining before you open the door.If you respond to the whining by opening the door, he will learn that whining gets positive attention from you.

, Other than mealtime, practice closing the door when you leave the room. Give your Collie a verbal command (‘kennel’) to enter the crate, point toward the crate door, and give him a treat when he enters the crate. Close the door, sit with him quietly for a few minutes, then leave the room. Return after a few minutes, sit with him again, then let him out. Work up to leaving the room for 30 minutes at a time.When your Collie can handle you leaving the room, leave your home after closing the crate door. Stay calm when leaving your home and returning so your Collie doesn’t feel anxious about being left in the crate.Let him out of the crate when you return.
You can also practice leaving your Collie in the crate overnight.

, Collies love to be around people, so your Collie may start feeling lonely and isolated if you leave him in the crate for more than a few hours at a time. If your Collie is a puppy, he won’t be able to hold his bladder for very long and would need frequent potty breaks. In general, the number of hours a puppy can hold its bladder is 1 more than its month in ages.For example, a 4-month old puppy can hold its bladder for 5 hours.
Long hours in the crate can also negatively affect a dog’s muscle condition., With crate training, your Collie should see the crate as a place of a safety and comfort. Never place your Collie in his crate to discipline him.If you do this, he will have a negative association with the crate and probably won’t want to spend any time in it.

, Your Collie should learn to eliminate in the same general area outside. If you have a backyard, take him out on the leash and let him choose where to go. If possible, guide him toward an area that provides protection from wind and rain.When he eliminates in the area, he will leave his scent there and go back to that location each time., Proper house training will teach your Collie not just where to eliminate, but also when to eliminate. The sooner you can get your Collie on a bathroom schedule, the less likely he’ll have accidents in the house. If you have a Collie puppy, he’ll need to eliminate first thing in the morning, before bed, and after eating, drinking, or being crated.A puppy should also eliminate after playtime.If you have an adult Collie, take him out after his meals.
If your work schedule prevents you from taking your puppy out frequently, he can use pee pads indoors. Take him to the pee pads and give him a treat when he eliminates on them so he knows to use them when you’re gone.
Reward your Collie with verbal praise and extra petting or a treat each time he eliminates outside.

, While you’re at home with your Collie, keep watch for signs that he needs to eliminate. This is very important if you have a puppy. For example, he may start sniffing the floor, looking at you, or going to the door. When you see these behaviors, take him outside immediately.Praise and reward him when he eliminates outside.

, Your Collie will probably have some accidents as you house train him. Cleaning up the accident won’t be any fun for you, but do not take it out on him. Never punish your Collie by rubbing his nose in the feces or urine, yelling at him, etc. Punishment will not prevent future accidents. Rather, it will make him fear you.Clean up the accident quiet and calmly. To keep your Collie from going back to that same spot, use an enzymatic cleaner that will erase the scent of urine., Learning basic commands will help your Collie be well behaved at home and in public. Sit, stay, come, and heel are basic commands. Since Collies are so intelligent and eager to please, it probably won’t take long before your Collie masters each of these commands.


Once your Collie learns the basic commands, challenge him with more advanced commands and tricks, like rolling over and playing dead.

, Collies usually don’t bark very much, but will bark excessively if they become bored or lonely.If your Collie’s barking has become a nuisance, you can address the problem in several ways. For example, you can teach him the ‘speak’ and ‘quiet’ commands so you can control when he barks.If your Collie is bored, give him some new toys to play with. Give him food puzzle toys to keep him busy for long periods of time.
Schedule daily playtimes with your Collie so he doesn’t feel so lonely.
If your Collie’s barking continues to be a problem, ask your veterinarian or a veterinary behaviorist for advice.

, Collies enjoy the physical and mental challenge of activities like agility training, rally, and obedience. These activities would allow your Collie to release pent-up energy and spend much-needed time with you.Ask your veterinarian or other Collie owners for local training classes.

, Collies are natural herders.However, this herding instinct could become problematic if not used properly. For example, your Collie may want to herd your children or other people. He may bite and nip while he’s herding, which could be frightening for young children.Your Collie may also want to chase after cars, which could lead to serious injury.
Unless you are specifically training your Collie to herd, discourage him from herding. If you see him herding something inappropriate, try giving him a firm “No!” and redirecting his behavior toward an appropriate physical activity like playing fetch.

Don’t punish your dog.,
Learn to positively reinforce good behaviors.,
Avoid overusing treats.",How to Tame a Dog3," Dog experts agree that punishing a dog for bad behavior simply doesn’t work because a dog’s brain doesn’t work like a human’s brain. Dogs don’t have the same reasoning skills and don’t plan or premeditate as we do. They live in the moment. By the time you punish a dog for a behavior, he thinks he’s being punished for whatever he is currently doing – not the behavior he was doing previously to instigate your correction. Therefore, catch him in the act or immediately before it and express your disapproval.


Correct your dog’s behavior through either a) giving or not giving a reward if your dog already knows commands (“No!” is not a command) or b) giving a reward or verbally reprimanding in a firm tone. Yelling and hitting don’t work because they are not a natural means of communicating for a dog.Don’t try to have a conversation with your dog or put him in “time out.” These are corrections deriving from human psychology, not dog psychology.
The correction should be just enough to get your dog to listen, not to the point that he cowers or displays fear.
It should match the intensity of the behavior. If your correction is less intense than the behavior, the dog won’t listen to you. If it’s too intense or harsh, your dog can become fearful, insecure, confused and untrusting of you.
Do not use your dog’s name when correcting. Only say it when using positive reinforcement.

, Experts also almost universally agree that if you want your dog to behave in a certain way or to change a behavior, use positive reinforcement. Positive reinforcement uses praise and/or treats to reward your dog when he does what you want him to do. There are two critical elements to using positive reinforcement effectively. First, the reward must be given within seconds of the action. Otherwise your dog will think he’s being rewarded for whatever he’s doing the moment you give the treat. Second, you and everyone in the household have to be consistent.


Make sure everyone in your home knows the commands you use and the reward system you have in place.And remember that correction and positive reinforcement go hand-in-hand. Both are needed.

, When you’re initially teaching your dog a command or trying to stop bad behaviors, give a treat each time your dog does what is instructed of him. Once he’s learned or unlearned the behavior, taper down on using treats as his reward. Start by giving him a treat every 4 out of 5 times he responds properly. After awhile, move it to 3 and so forth until treats are only given as a reward occasionally.


Don’t decrease too fast, however, because your dog will become frustrated and much of your progress could be lost.
The goal is for your dog to work for your verbal praise because he wants you to be happy."
"
Provide stability through a regular, daily routine.,
Feed your dog in a consistent fashion.,
Give your dog plenty of exercise.,
Make sure he has plenty of chances to go potty.,
Get your dog on a regular sleep schedule.,
Provide for play and mental stimulation.",How to Tame a Dog4," Like many humans, dogs are creatures of habit and their behavior is often determined by how they feel about their environment. A routine gives a dog a sense of security because he knows what to expect, thus reducing anxiety, hyperactivity, etc. The owner must be consistent with the routine, however, or the dog will not feel safe and secure.


Sit down and write out a schedule for your dog that takes into account both his and your needs.
Make sure it includes sleeping, exercise, feeding, ""potty"" breaks, mental stimulation and play.
If you need to adjust the schedule, try to do it gradually and only change one aspect of the routine at a time. , Feeding your dog at the same time, the same amount, the same food (without sugar) and in the same place each day provides consistency and will help regulate your dog’s metabolism and digestion. A hungry dog isn’t a happy dog. Establishing a feeding schedule is also important because it will help you be consistent about potty breaks and your dog avoid “mistakes” in your home.


A grown dog should eat twice per day, while a puppy should eat three times per day unless your veterinarian has advised otherwise.
To avoid nibbling throughout the day – and the “mistakes” it often creates – put your dog’s food bowl down, indicate it’s time to eat, leave it there for 5 minutes and then put it away.Feed your dog after his walks or exercise because this mimics his natural instinct to work for his food.
Also ensure that your dog has plenty of clean, fresh water at all times, especially after exercise.Take your dog to a vet if he stops eating much or if he gobbles everything down immediately., All dogs need exercise for good health. Walking, in particular, is critical because dogs have a “migration instinct” to find food. Thus, it fulfills your dog’s physical and mental needs. A dog that is hyper or has behavioral issues may need even more walking than the average dog. While it might sound counterintuitive to give a hyper dog more opportunities for active movement, it actually helps calm them down because they’re using that extra energy. Dogs who are taken on daily walks are also less destructive, obsessive, and have fewer problems with separation anxiety and dominance issues.


Ideally, you should walk your dog in the morning after he eats and again in the evening. Doing this will also give your dog a chance to relieve himself.Dogs with high energy should be taken on walks more than twice per day to relieve the extra energy
Don’t take your dog on a vigorous walk right before bedtime, though, because this can make it hard for him to sleep.
If you’re unable to meet his walking needs, give your dog plenty of time outside in a fenced yard or hire a dog walker.Also provide your dog with other means of exercising, such as playing catch or going to the dog park to play with other dogs.

, A full bladder can make for an irritable dog, and many mistakes in the home. It’s important that he has plenty of chances to go outside and relieve himself beyond daily walks. It’s also best to stick to a potty schedule. Look for the following cues that your dog needs to go potty.For young puppies, don’t wait for cues because there often aren’t any. They don’t yet have control of their sphincters. This means as soon as they feel the need to “go,” they are already “going.” It also means they often don’t eliminate everything all at once. So take him outside first thing in the morning, a few minutes after eating or drinking, after lively play, and as many other times as you can.
Older puppies have more control but still don’t eliminate everything all at once. So, they need to be let outside on a consistent schedule, in addition to plenty of times. However, they are learning so signs include: restlessness, sniffing, circling, or suddenly running to another room or to the corner of a room.
Grown dogs signal by whining; standing, pawing or barking at the door; standing by you and wagging their tails; and restlessness., Counting the many naps they take throughout the day, most breeds sleep an average of 14 hours per day. In the wild, dogs sleep in dens, so create a confined, designated place for your dog to sleep. Or buy a dog pillow that accommodates his instinctive need for shelter and that he associates with sleeping. You should also wake him up at the same time each day.If your dog is restless at night, consider getting a crate. Make going into the crate a more enticing experience by throwing in a treat or a toy before smiling and saying your version of, “Bedtime!” Then praise your dog once in the crate, tell them “Goodnight,” and leave them alone.
You don’t want your dog to associate the crate with punishment, but you do want to make nighttime a routine, with a consistent bedtime.
Also make sure to take your dog outside to relieve himself immediately before bedtime. If you find your dog having mistakes at night, regulate his water intake in the evening.
Additionally, readjust your dog’s evening feeding schedule if he’s having trouble sleeping at night. You could be feeding him too early or too late., A bored dog can get into lots of trouble and be hyperactive. Channel and redirect his energy with toys and canine puzzles (rotate them out); giving him ""jobs"" to do like playing fly ball, fetch, Frisbee (dogs are bred to hunt and herd); teaching him tricks; arranging for interactions with other dogs; and running errands together, such as a quick trip to the mailbox or a ride in the car."

Consider enrolling your sheltie in herding training.",How to Train Shelties," Crate training will have several benefits . For example, it will allow your sheltie to see the crate as a place of safety and comfort. In addition, crate training will make it easy to transport him when it’s time to go to the vet. Crate training will also keep your sheltie in a confined and comfortable space until he understands the house rules.At the end of crate training, your sheltie will have a place to call his own in your home.;
, Several types of crates are available. Airline-approved crates are ideal because they are very sturdy; inquire at your local pet store about this type of crate.A collapsible fabric crate would not be a good choice, since your sheltie could make it collapse when you’re not watching him.Choose a crate in which he could stand up and lie down comfortably, but not have enough space to create a separate bathroom area.


A good-sized crate for shelties is 30 inches long x 21 inches wide x 24 inches high (76 cm x 53 cm x 61 cm)., The more comfortable and cozy you make the crate, the more likely your sheltie will want to spend time inside of it. Put some of his favorite toys inside the crate, along with some food puzzle toys (e.g., Kong toys).Consider placing a blanket or some towels over the crate to give it a cozy, den-like feel.In addition, place a comfortable blanket inside the crate on which he can lie.Along with his food bowl, choose a sturdy and spill-proof water bowl to go inside the crate.Place the crate in an area of your home with a lot of human activity, such as the family room., Your sheltie may quickly and happily trot into the crate on his own, or he may need some time and extra coaxing. When you bring him over to the crate the first time, talk to him in a bright and cheery voice. If he still seems a little hesitant, entice him with food: place a few bits of food just outside the crate at first, then put the food further and further into his crate until your sheltie walks all the way in.An adult sheltie may not be so keen on entering the crate, especially if he’s spent his whole life outside of a crate. He will probably need some extra time warming up to the idea of crate training.Do not force or push your sheltie into the crate.He will enter the crate when he is ready, so work at his pace.
Keep the crate door open so your sheltie can enter and exit the crate when he chooses.

, When your sheltie is comfortable entering the crate, begin feeding him his meals in the crate. While he’s munching on his food, gently close the door behind him. Open the door when he finishes eating. After each meal, leave the door closed for gradually longer periods of time.If he whines, wait until he stops whining to open the door. You don’t want him to learn that whining is his way to get out of the crate when the door is closed.

, At the end of crate training, your sheltie should be able to stay in the crate for several hours at a time, including overnight.To work up to this, close the crate door when he goes inside (outside of meal time), leave the room, and return to the crate at random time intervals.Give your sheltie a verbal command (e.g., ‘kennel,’ ‘crate’) to enter the crate. Give him verbal praise and a treat as soon as he goes inside the crate.
Practice leaving him in the crate when you leave home. Leave and come back without fanfare so you don't create high levels of anxiety or anticipation.Remember that puppies cannot hold their bladders for very long. For example, a 4-month old puppy can only hold his bladder for about 4 hours. Whether puppy or adult, do not leave your sheltie crated for more than 6 hours at a time, unless you crate him overnight., When you begin house training your sheltie, keep him in a small room (e.g., bathroom) or a small area of a larger room (e.g., kitchen) where the floors are easy to clean. Place a puppy pee pad in that area so your sheltie has a place to eliminate if you are gone for long periods of time. When he becomes house trained, he can have access to more areas of your home.Be aware that using a pee pad can make it challenging to encourage your sheltie to eliminate only outside.

, If you have a backyard, take your sheltie to an area that is relatively protected from the elements (e.g., wind, rain).Let him choose the specific elimination spot in that area. Once he leaves his scent there, he will go to that spot each time you take him outside.If you do not have a backyard, consider choosing an open area where he could eliminate during his walk. Make sure this area is not on someone else’s private property, and clean up his feces promptly.

, House training will be a lot easier when your sheltie knows when he is expected to go to the bathroom. If you have a sheltie puppy, take him out after he wakes up, eats, or drinks water.You should also let him eliminate before he goes to bed and whenever you let him out of the crate.Adult dogs do not need to go out as frequently as puppies, but should still be on a set schedule. For example, take your adult sheltie out after each meal.

, Since shelties are eager to please, your sheltie will need your verbal praise and approval (‘good dog!’ or ‘good job!’) when he eliminates outside.When he gets positive feedback from you, he will associate eliminating outside with a reward, making him more likely to repeat the same good behavior.

, If your sheltie has an accident in the house, clean it up without fanfare or punishment. Use an enzymatic cleaner (without ammonia) that will eliminate the urine scent so he does not have an accident in that same area.If you can, keep him out of the room so he doesn’t see you clean up the accident; if he sees you, he may think it’s okay to eliminate inside the house.Do not punish your sheltie! Whether or not you witnessed the accident as it happened, rubbing his nose in the urine or feces will not discourage him from having another accident. It will only make him fearful of you., Shelties are very smart and intelligent, so it probably won’t take long for your sheltie to learn basic commands. They can frequently learn a command the first time it is given.Basic commands to teach your sheltie include sit, stay, come, and heel.


Consider enrolling your sheltie in an obedience class to teach him basic commands. Don’t be surprised if he ends up being at the top of the class!
Once your sheltie masters one command, move on to the next one. Your sheltie will become bored if you keep practicing a command he’s already mastered.Challenge him with different tricks and commands, like playing dead and giving you his paw.

, Your sheltie’s natural protectiveness may cause him to bark a lot. A sheltie’s bark can be loud and piercing, so you should train your sheltie not to bark so much. This training will involve you first commanding him to bark (‘speak’), then to be ‘quiet.’These two commands will allow you to control when your sheltie barks.

, Your sheltie’s intelligence and high energy level makes him a great candidate for agility training. Agility training involves jumping, climbing, and navigating over obstacles. It will keep your sheltie physically active and mentally stimulated.Ask your veterinarian or other sheltie owners for recommendations on nearby agility training courses.

, Shelties have a strong herding instinct. If you live on a farm, you may want to hone your Sheltie’s herding abilities. Be aware that your sheltie may have to first pass an ‘instinct test’ to ensure he has the instinct to herd, rather than chase, animals.Search for herding training clubs in your area.
You can also teach your sheltie to herd on your own.
Do not encourage herding behavior if you do not live in an environment that requires herding. For example, if you have kids, don’t have your sheltie herd them—this could lead to your sheltie biting your kids."

If it’s too big, your pug will create a space to urinate and defecate; if it’s too small, he won’t be able to get comfortable in it.


Your pug is little, so he won’t need a huge crate. An ideal crate size is 24 inches long x 18 inches wide x 21 inches high (61 cm x 46 cm x 53cm).;
, Your pug’s crate should be a place of safety and comfort for him. Add some ‘creature comforts’ to the crate, including favorite toys and a comfortable blanket. Place a blanket on top of the crate so it feels like a cozy den to your pug.Put a spill-proof water bowl in the crate to keep him from making a watery mess.Food is a great way to lure your pug into the crate. If he’s hesitant to enter the crate, place some bits of food near the crate initially, then gradually put the food further inside the crate.Do the same with his food bowl when he’s ready for eating meals in the crate.
Leave the crate door open at all times during this part of crate training. This will allow your pug to explore the crate at his leisure, without fear of you closing the door behind him.

, For crate training to be effective, your pug must learn to be comfortable in the crate when its door is closed. When your pug is eating a meal in the crate, close the door and open it as soon as he’s finished. Gradually, have your pug wait up to 10 minutes after a meal before you open the door.If he whines, wait until he quiets down before opening the door.

, You may need to leave your pug crated for hours at a time during the day, and maybe overnight. To get him used to this stretch of time, give your pug a verbal command (‘kennel up’ or ‘crate’) to enter the crate (not at meal time). Sit with him briefly, leave the room for few minutes, then return to the crate. Work up to leaving the room for 30 minutes.It may take several repetitions before your pug learns the verbal command to enter the crate. Reward him with a treat each time he responds to it correctly.
Practice leaving the house when you crate him. Do not get your pug worked up when you leave home or return; this could build up a lot of anxiety and anticipation in your pug.Don’t forget to take your pug outside to potty during crate training. This is especially important for puppies, since they can’t hold their bladders for very long (month of age + 1 hour)., A common concern with crate training is whether to respond to whining, especially with overnight crating. You don’t want to ignore your pug’s whining if he really needs to potty, but you also don’t want to teach him that whining gets positive attention from you. If he doesn’t stop whining after a few minutes, let him outside, but do not play or talk with him—let him eliminate and that’s it.If your pug is whining just to get attention, he’ll stop whining after he realizes it’s not working. Just be prepared for the whining to get worse before it gets better.

, If you cannot stay with your pug all day and take him outside frequently, gate off an area in your home for him to stay during the day. Place some pee pads in the corner of this space where he can eliminate.In addition to the pee pads, put some puzzle toys and other toys in the area to keep him busy.An alternative to a pee pad is a doggie litter box, which has artificial grass. When your pug urinates, the urine would go through the grass into the underlying tray.These are available at your local pet store.
Place his water bowl and bed in the gated area.

, Without knowing when he should eliminate, your pug may have accidents in your home more often. A consistent bathroom routine is very important for puppies, since they cannot hold their bladders for very long. If you have a pug puppy, take him out first thing in the morning, 15 to 20 minutes after eating, after naps, and before bedtime.Give your pug puppy his final meal around 7pm and take his water away by 10 or 11pm. This will reduce the chances of him having to eliminate frequently overnight.If you have an adult pug, he won’t need to go out as frequently as a puppy, but should still go out about 3 times a day.The indoor gated area lessens the need for frequent outings during the day. However, it may take longer to house train your pug if he gets used to eliminating on pee pads or in the litter box.

, Your pug should learn to eliminate in the same area each time you take him outside. If you have a backyard, take him out on a 6-foot (2-meter) leash, stand in one area of your yard, and let him pick a specific spot within a 6-foot radius of the leash.He will leave his scent in that spot and go back there each time.

, Your pug’s body language will let you know when he needs to eliminate, allowing you to get him outside before he has an accident in the house. Examples of this body language are sniffing around, looking for a private place, going to the door, and whining.When you see this body language, immediately put your pug’s leash on him and take him outside. Give him a treat and verbal praise when he eliminates so he makes a positive association with eliminating outside.
Consider giving your pug a command, such as ‘go potty,’ when you take him out.When you reward him for eliminating, he will also be learning how to respond to your command.

, It can take time—up to 20 minutes—for your pug to relax enough to eliminate outside. If you become impatient, you may experience what many other dog owners have experienced: elimination as soon as the dog gets back inside. Twenty minutes can feel like an eternity, so bring something with you (e.g., book, magazine, phone) to keep you busy as your wait for your pug to eliminate.Don’t forget to reward him as soon as he eliminates.

, If you pug has an accident (and he probably will) clean it up promptly with an enzymatic cleaner that will erase the urine smell.If your pug smells the urine, he will likely go back to that spot to eliminate. Do not punish your pug, whether you catch him in the act or not. Doing so will make him fear you, rather than teach him not to have another accident., Pugs aim to please, but can get sidetracked by a short attention span. To keep your own pug focused, teach him the ‘focus’ command. Put your finger on his nose, say ‘focus,’ then place this finger on your own nose. When your pug stays focused on your finger on your nose, immediately give him a treat. Lengthen the time he watches your finger before you reward him. When he’s mastered it, use it each time he gets distracted during training sessions.Because of the short attention span, keep your training sessions short (about 15 minutes or less) and repeat the lessons frequently., When your pug learns the basic commands, he will have the proper foundation to behave well and learn even more commands. Basic commands include sit, stay, come, and heel. If his short attention span is making training difficult, consider enrolling him in a local dog obedience class.


Use plenty of positive reinforcement (verbal praise, treats, extra petting) each time your pug correctly follows a command. The more excited and positive you are, the more your pug will try to please you and behave properly.

, Pugs love to chew. Teaching your pug to 'leave it' will help keep him from chewing something inappropriate (e.g., furniture, shoes). The 'drop it' command will teach him to drop whatever is in mouth, particularly if it's something he’s not supposed to chew on.

, Training an adult pug requires a different approach than what you’d use with a puppy. Your adult pug may have had some previous training, but it may not have been completed or consistently reinforced. Ask the rescue group or animal shelter from where you adopted your pug about what types of additional training he will need.Older dogs are calmer and tend to have longer attention spans than puppies.Adult dogs are more set in their ways (including bad habits) and may take longer to train. Be patient with your adult pug during the training process., If your adult pug was mistreated by his previous owner, he may be extra sensitive to yelling or harsh punishment.As you train your adult pug, always keep a calm temper, including when he has an accident or doesn’t follow a command.

, If you have other household members, have them all train your adult pug. By involving everyone, your pug will feel like he’s part of your pack, which will help him feel safe and loved.To prevent him from getting confused from working with different people, make sure everyone uses the same commands, says the commands in the same tone of voice, and does not deviate from the training process (e.g., letting him get away with bad behavior).

",How to Train Your Beagle," Beagles were bred mostly in packs, and it is important that they learn early who the master is.;
, Introduce them slowly to other pets in your home.

, Stick to a specific schedule and take him outside as often as every hour at first.


Purchase a crate that will fit your beagle as an adult. The crate should measure approximately 3 feet (.9 meters) long. If the crate is too large, the puppy may choose an area to eliminate at one end and sleep at the other.
Wire crates work best as many puppies will chew a plastic one.

, Check online, local libraries and local organizations. Your veterinarian can also provide suggestions for training.

, Have them work on a single command at a time until it is mastered.

,


Local shelters, pet stores and other organizations offer them at low cost. Consider visiting one of the classes prior to enrolling to make sure that you agree with the type of training presented.

Find a trainer.",How to Tame a Dog5," Your demeanor impacts your dogs in everyday life. If you’re running around bursting with energy, your dog might become excited, too. If you want to tame your dog, you need to stay cool and calm. The same applies when you are training your dog. He won’t get it right on the first try, nor maybe even the 10th. If you can stay calm, as an Alpha should, he’ll be more calm and more able to learn commands.Your dog will sense and associate unhappiness with training if you become frustrated or use a mean tone of voice.
Always reward your dog when he or she obeys the command. You can use verbal praise, food, or affection like a belly run or a pet.
Finally, you should not teach commands until you have bonded with your dog and he trusts you. And you should always praise your dog when he responds as you want.

, Begin in a quiet environment when teaching all commands so your dog isn’t distracted. Hold your dog’s leash (use one that is 6 feet long) in your right hand and position him on your left facing forward. Gently run your fingers along your dog’s spine to his hip joints and give a firm but gentle squeeze while saying, “Sit.” Push his hips down with your left hand and raise the leash with your right. Stretch out the word “sit” until he is sitting. When he sits, be enthusiastic and praise him. Repeat until your dog responds and then do the command without pushing down on his hips.


Once he’s mastered this, simply say, “Sit,” and don’t pull up on the leash.
If he’s not responding after several training sessions, give the command “Sit” and gently jerk the leash while you push down on his hip joints., With your dog on your left, hold the leash in your right hand, kneel on your left knee and say “Down” in a firm voice. While doing this, lift your dog’s two front paws slightly and pull them forward so he’s on the ground. Praise him after each repetition. Once he learns this, introduce the hand signal for lie down. Get him in the sit position, kneel on your left knee and extend the leash about 12” to the right of your dog. You don’t want slack in the leash. Then bring your hand – flat with your fingers closed and your palm down – above your dog’s eye level and slightly to the right of his head. Say “Down” as you lower your hand to the ground.


After this, combine the command and hand signal, moving further away from your dog each time until you’ve reached about 6 feet between the two of you., Place your dog in the sitting position on your left and say “Stay” in a firm voice. At the same time, quickly place your hand – flattened with your fingers closed – about 4” from his face. Don’t touch his face, only block his vision. Next pivot your right foot and step in front of your dog, extending the leash about 18” straight up so the leash and collar are both high on his neck. Praise him every time he remains in position.


After he’s got this down, practice by moving backward as you say the command. If he starts to move toward you, step toward him and raise the leash. Do this until he stays, and then continue to step further away., Place your dog in the sit position and stand facing him, with just a little slack in the leash. In an excited tone of voice, say, “Okay, , come!” If he doesn’t immediately come, tug the leash gently on the word “Okay.” When he comes to you, praise him. You can add a hand gesture by saying “Okay,"" moving your right hand up and swinging it around toward your left shoulder, and finishing with “come!”


You should only use your dog’s name with movement commands such as this., Position your dog in a sitting position on your left-hand side. Hold the leash firmly yet allow it to drape between you and your dog, who should be about 3 feet ahead of you. Begin walking and then say, “heel!” in a firm voice.


If your dog runs ahead, wait until the leash is fully stretched and then say “Heel!” in a loud, authoritative voice.
While doing this, make a sharp U-turn to the right and walk quickly in that direction.
If your dog is lagging behind, use words of encouragement to get him to pick up the pace or to start walking. If that doesn’t work, gently jerk the leash., If this isn’t working for you – or if your dog is aggressive – get a trainer to work with him. Ask how long they’ve been training, how many dogs they’ve trained, which breeds, etc. You can also go and sit in on a training class to see if it’s effective and if the trainer is using praise not punishment.

Remember that chihuahuas are delicate and fragile!,
Don't play 'dress-up'.,
Give it some downtime before you try to teach him anything.,
Let her know who is the alpha in the household (and it shouldn't be her).,
If your chihuahua has any bad behavior, correct it immediately!,
Make a safe spot where your chihuahua can go to have some private time or where it can go when it is scared or feels angry or threatened.,
Take your chihuahua outside to do its personal business about the same time every day.,
Give your chihuahua treat/s and praise when it does something that you want it to.",How to Train Chihuahuas,";
, When training your chihuahua, don't dress it in clothes or carry it around with you until you train it. Show your chihuahua that you are the leader of the pack. You carrying her does not give her that message. She will think she is the boss!

, You want to let it get used to your home a little bit before you start training.

, Most of the time they walk into a house and think they are the leaders-not you, so you do want to show that you are the pack leader as soon as they walk through the door.


To do that, make them wait for permission to eat and do things like jumping on a bed. if they don't, take away their food or take them off the bed. You don't want to be aggressive though. You want to show kindness and that you can be trusted and be a good pack leader. Also to hold your chihuahua after it gets used to you and your home support its belly and butt like you would a baby. You want your chihuahua to feel safe and secure, not scared and afraid! Also this shows you are pack leader.

, Biting, growling, unnecessary aggression with food, you have to correct immediately! If you don't, your chihuahua might think it's okay to act that way and you won't be able to stop that behavior as easily! To stop your chihuahua from acting that way say, no in a stern, clear voice until your chihuahua stops. If your chihuahua continues then you should hold it in your arms again supporting its belly and bottom. Don't say your chihuahua's name when you tell him/her to stop.

, Maybe you could buy or make your chihuahua a nice soft dog bed. Not a crate or cage because they will have too much energy from being cooped up! Even a blanket on the couch or easy chair could work. Just make sure your chihuahua can be safe there and that it's easy access. Also maybe a doggy door to a fenced area outside could work.(except for in the winter)

, You should walk your chihuahua about four times a day (morning, noon, evening, and before you go to bed). The reason you should aim for the same time each day is so your chihuahua will know about when it can go the bathroom and how long it has to hold it. if you know you're going to be gone when you and your chihuahua usually walk, then maybe ask your neighbor to walk him/her for you and maybe (if they have a dog) walk their dog in return sometime. Go through the same door to the same place every time so that your chihuahua can get your routine down pat!

, Chihuahuas have the largest brain relative to their size compared to any other breed in the world. they are also the smartest breed and understand to and respond well to positive praise and treats. He/she will do it again to get the reward and praise from whatever you praise it for. So don't give them praise or reward if they did something bad for they will continue doing it to get the reward that follows.

Consider getting help from a certified professional dog trainer.",How to Housebreak an Adult Dog," Unlike puppies who just don’t know how to ask to go outside when they need to go, an adult dog may have much more complicated reasons for why it eliminates inside the house. If you have recently adopted an adult dog or you want to retrain your adult dog, you should first take some time to consider the reason(s) why your dog may be eliminating inside your home. Taking time to figure out what is going on with your dog will help you to decide on the best course of action., Before you try to housebreak your adult dog, you should take him to the veterinarian to have a check-up. Some adult dogs begin to have problems with elimination due to medical issues. Your veterinarian can assess your dog to see if a medical condition is causing him to urinate or defecate inside the house. Common medical conditions that may lead to problems with your dog eliminating in the house include:


Changes in your dog’s diet
Gastrointestinal issues
Urinary tract infection
Bladder stones
Post-spaying hormone issues in female dogs
Medications
Arthritis
Age related cognitive dysfunction, Some dogs develop problems with eliminating inside the house because a beloved family member has left the home or because someone has been added to the home. Consider the recent departures and arrivals in your family to determine if this may be the cause of your dog’s elimination problems.


Did one of your children recently go off to college? Or did you recently get a new puppy? If a recent change is the cause of your dog’s elimination problems, it may take time for your dog to get used to the new family situation.
Be patient and do things to let your dog know hat he is still valued and loved despite the changes. Play with him, give him praise, toys, and treats to help him feel more secure., Some dogs develop fear or anxiety about going outside and may begin eliminating in the house as a result. If your dog seems reluctant to go outside, there may be something about the experience that is frightening to him.


Try to determine what is causing your dog’s reluctance to eliminate outside. For example, if your dog is frightened by the sound of passing cars, he may end up not eliminating enough or at all when you take him out for a walk., Some dogs don’t like to go outside because they have developed a preference for a certain type of surface. Common surface preferences include carpet, concrete, and furniture. Identifying your dog's surface preference may be necessary in order to retrain him to go to the bathroom outside.


Pay attention to where your dog goes to the bathroom most often. Does he prefer to go on the carpet, on the tile floor, on a pile of laundry, or somewhere else? Can you think of any reason why he might prefer that spot over going outside?
A surface preference may be related to the dog’s previous environment. For example, a dog that spent the last few years living in an environment where he was seldom let outside may have developed a surface preference for carpet. Or, a dog that was raised in a laboratory may have a surface preference for concrete., Having a solid daily routine may help your dog to stop eliminating inside the house. Make sure that you feed your dog at the same times every day and take your dog outside at the same times every day. Your dog should be allowed to go outside to eliminate at least four times per day. If your dog’s feeding and outside times have become erratic, decide on a schedule that will work for you and stick to it. A sample schedule for feeding and taking your dog out might be something like:6:00am: let Fido outside
7:00am: feed Fido breakfast
7:30am: let Fido outside
12:00pm: let Fido outside
5:00pm: take Fido for a walk
7:00pm: feed Fido dinner
7:30pm: let Fido outside

, In addition to keeping a steady routine for taking your dog outside, taking him to the same spot every time may also help you to housebreak your dog. Use an encouraging phrase such as “go potty” to let your dog know what you want him to do when you get to that spot. The repetition of going to the same place and hearing the same words will help your dog understand what you want from him.Remember to offer your dog lots of praise after he goes to the bathroom outside.

, Watching your dog for signs that he might be about to urinate or defecate in the house can help you to housebreak him. If your dog is prone to eliminating inside the house, find a way to keep him in your sight at all times. Monitoring your dog’s whereabouts will help you to prevent him from eliminating inside the house.


Try keeping your dog on a six foot long leash that is attached to you. This will prevent him from going off to another room to eliminate and it will also help you to observe his behavior and determine when he needs to go.If you cannot keep an eye on your dog during the day, you can use a crate or baby gate to confine your dog to a small area for short periods of time (less than 4 hours)., As soon as you notice that your dog is getting ready to urinate or defecate, get his attention by clapping your hands together loudly. Do not yell at your dog or use physical punishment to change his behavior. Just clap your hands to get his attention and then lead or carry him outside right away.


Be kind and encouraging to your dog as you lead him outside. If you yell or act like you are angry with him, he may begin to associate going outside with punishment., The smell of a prior mess can prompt your dog to want to eliminate in the same place again. The best way to prevent your dog from soiling an area again is to clean up his messes right away by using an enzymatic cleaner made especially for cleaning up pet messes.Don’t yell or punish your dog for going inside the house. It will not do anything to discourage him and it may even lead to more accidents by increasing his fear and anxiety., Positive reinforcement is the best way to teach your dog a new behavior. Make sure that you reward your dog with lots of praise after he urinates or defecates outside. You can also reward your dog for eliminating outside by giving him treats, playtime, or a walk., To make sure that your dog does not have to hold it for long periods of time, ask a friend or neighbor to come by and take your dog out for you if you will be gone for a long period of time. Forcing your dog to stay in the house for several hours will lead to eliminating inside the house because he will not be able to hold it for that long.If you don’t know anyone who is willing or able to take your dog out for you during long periods away, consider hiring a pet sitter to stop by.

, If your veterinarian has identified a medical condition that requires special treatment, medication, or other interventions, make sure that you follow the veterinarian’s instructions. If your dog’s elimination problems are related to a medical condition, they will not improve until he is cured. Contact your veterinarian immediately if your dog’s condition worsens or does not improve despite treatment.

, You can get your dog to stop eliminating inside the house by gradually introducing grass to the type of surface your dog prefers to use. For example, if your dog prefers to urinate on carpet, place a piece of carpet or a small rug in your back yard. Allow your dog to use the rug, but add a handful of grass to the carpet every day. When the carpet is completely covered in grass and your dog is still using it, remove the carpet. Your dog should be used to using a grassy surface and continue eliminating on the grass., Simple changes to your daily routine or to your dog’s environment may help to ease some of his fears and anxieties. After you have identified the source of your dog’s fear, you can take steps to try to eliminate or reduce it. For example, if your dog is frightened by the sound of passing cars when you take him out for a walk, try taking a quieter route or taking your walk at a time of day when there is less traffic., Some dogs just don’t like to go outside when the weather is bad. You can help make the experience more tolerable for your dog by getting cold and/or wet weather gear for your dog. For example, if your dog does not like the feel of his paws in the snow, consider getting some boots for your dog to wear when you take him outside. Or, if your dog doesn’t like to get wet, consider getting him a raincoat to wear when it is raining., Some dogs have multiple reasons for why they are not housebroken or why they begin eliminating in the house after years of going outside. If your dog does not respond to your housebreaking efforts and there is no medical reason for your dog’s issues, you may want to consider hiring a certified professional dog trainer to help you housebreak your adult dog."

Choose a crate that will be large enough for him to stand up and move around in, but not so large that he can use a separate space to go to the bathroom. The crate should feel cozy to him, but not claustrophobic.A toy or miniature poodle’s crate should be 24 x 18 inches (61 x 46 cm) or 24 x 24 inches (61 x 61 cm). For a standard poodle, an ideal crate size is 48 x 36 inches (122 x 91 cm).;
, Crate training will go more smoothly if the crate looks inviting to your poodle. Place comfortable bedding in the crate that already has his scent on it. In addition, place some of his favorite toys in the crate, along with his food and water bowls.Place the crate in an area close to people.Since poodles love human companionship, having your Poodle’s crate in area with a lot of human activity will help him feel more comfortable.
Remember that the crate should be a place of comfort and peace, not punishment.

, Over the course of crate training, you will practice leaving your poodle in the crate for increasingly longer periods. To begin, leave the crate door open and toss some treats inside. When your Poodle enters the crate to eat the treats, immediately give him verbal praise. Do not force him into the crate if he is hesitant—let him enter on his own time so he will not have a negative association with the crate.Work up to feeding him his meals in the crate.It may help to give your poodle a verbal command, such as ‘kennel,’ when you want him to enter the kennel. Immediately give him a treat when he enters the crate after your command., When your poodle is comfortable entering his crate, start closing the door behind him. Begin by closing it only for a few seconds when he is inside, then opening it back up again. Next, close the crate’s door and leave the room, randomly coming back for short time periods. Over time, gradually increase the time you stay out of the room after closing the crate door.Do not open the crate door if your poodle whines or fusses. Doing so will teach him a bad habit for getting attention.Even as your puppy becomes comfortable with staying in the crate with the door closed, you should not leave him in there day and night. He will not be able to hold his bladder for that long, and he will start feeling lonely by not being able to interact with you., Whether you have a puppy or an adult poodle, it is best to start house training him soon after bringing him home. The earlier you begin, the quicker your poodle will know the proper place to go to the bathroom. The longer you wait, the more ingrained bad bathroom habits can become, making house training that much harder.Poodles tend to be house trained quite easily.Poodles have great memories, and will therefore remember the good and bad habits.Make sure he remembers only the good bathroom habits!

, Your poodle should know when it is time to go outside to use the bathroom. Since puppies cannot hold their bladders for very long, they will need to go out more frequently. Good times to take your puppy out are first thing in the morning, after playing, and after eating or drinking.As a rule of thumb, puppies can hold their bladder for approximately 1 hour per month of age, up until 9 to 12 months.As your puppy poodle ages, wait for longer periods before taking him out after different activities. This will strengthen his bladder muscles.Adult dogs can hold their bladders for longer, but should still be on a bathroom schedule.
Keep the schedule consistent to decrease the chance of accidents in the house.

, Your poodle should go to the bathroom in the same place every time he goes outside. This will help him remember where he should go. If you have a backyard, choose an area that is away from areas where people would go (e.g., children’s play area, garden). The area should also be away from potential distractions, such as a busy street.If you have a puppy and are not able to take him out several times a day, consider setting up an indoor bathroom area near his crate. Put some puppy pee pads down so he can relieve himself when you are not home. As he gets older and can hold his bladder for longer, discontinue using the pee pads.If you do not have a yard, pick a nearby grassy area.

, Although you should identify the general area where your poodle should go, allow him to pick the exact spot within that area. When you take him outside, let him sniff around and explore within the general area until he settles on a specific spot.After he picks the spot and relieves himself, take him to that specific area each time you take him outside.

, It may be tempting to give your poodle only a few minutes to go to the bathroom before you bring him in, especially if you are in a rush. However, rushing your Poodle when he is outside will not be very effective for house training—he may hold it so he can spend more time with you inside, increasing the chances of him having an accident.Ideally, you should give your poodle about 15 to 20 minutes outside., As you house train your poodle, reward him with positive reinforcement (e.g., verbal praise, extra petting) when he eliminates outside. However, if he has an accident, do not punish him. Punishing him will make him fearful of you and make house training more difficult.If he has an accident, clean it up without making a fuss. Use an enzymatic cleaner that will remove the odor so your poodle will not go back to that same spot.If you catch him in the act of having an accident, interrupt him with a firm verbal command (e.g., ‘outside!’), pick him up, and take him outside to his designated bathroom spot. When he finishes eliminating outside, give him verbal praise and a treat., As with other forms of training, it can be easy to train your poodle puppy to walk on a leash. First, he will need to get used to the leash and collar. Place the collar on him and let him wear it while he is eating and doing other activities around the house. He may try to wriggle it off, but do not take it off him until he has settled down.Use a plain, flat collar. It should be snug around his neck (snug enough to stick 1 or 2 fingers between his fur and the collar), but not tight.
Use a non-extendable leash that is 4 to 6 feet (1.2 to 1.8 meters) long.To acclimate your puppy to the leash, attach the leash to the collar and let him walk around like that inside your home. Keep a close eye on him so he doesn’t entangle himself in the leash., When your poodle puppy is comfortable with the leash and collar, take him on short walks inside your home. Hold the leash loosely and give him lots of verbal praise during the walk. If he begins to pull, stop immediately—if you continue walking, he will think it’s okay for him to pull and strain on the leash.When he behaves well on the leash inside, start taking him on short walks outside.
Gradually increase the lengths of the walks as your puppy becomes more comfortable with walking on the leash.

, When you begin to leash train your poodle, it is okay for him to walk slightly in front of you. As the training progresses, though, he should learn how to walk beside you. The ‘heel’ command instructs your poodle how to do this.


With your poodle standing on your left side, hold a squeaky toy or treat in your right hand. Allow him to see the toy, say ‘heel,’ and begin walking forward.Give him a reward (the toy or a treat) when he can walk beside you for 20 to 30 seconds.

, If you have a puppy, enroll him in a puppy kindergarten class when he is about 8 to 12 weeks old. This timeframe is critical for proper puppy socialization. Puppy kindergarten will teach your poodle how to socialize with other dogs and other people, and be obedient in distracting situations. It will also help your Poodle become more self-confident.In addition to puppy kindergarten, socialize him on your own at home. Invite your friends over to expose your puppy to new people in a friendly environment. When you take him out on walks, introduce him to friendly neighbors and let him hear some of the sounds of everyday life, like cars passing on the street.

, Obedience class is where your poodle will learn basic commands, such as sit, stay, and heel. Your veterinarian or the staff at your local pet store can give you recommendations on quality obedience classes in your area.Obedience class will not only teach your poodle basic commands, but will also teach him to see you as his leader.Whichever commands you learn in class, practice these commands at home between classes.

, No matter how smart your poodle is, and how much he wants to please you, he will not want long training sessions. Limit your training sessions to 10 minutes. Any longer than that, and your Poodle may become bored.Make the training sessions fun to prevent boredom. For example, show lots of enthusiasm and give your poodle positive reinforcement. The more excited you are, the more he will enjoy the training sessions.
Daily, consistent training will help you and your poodle develop a close bond.Since poodles enjoy working closely with their owners, your Poodle will likely enjoy working with you every day., When you teach your poodle basic commands, wait until he masters one before you move onto another.If you try to teach multiple commands at once, your poodle may become confused with what you are trying to teach him, and he may become discouraged. Fully mastering one command will give him the self-confidence to learn even more.

, Consistency is key when training a poodle. Continue to train your poodle throughout his life so he never forgets the commands.For example, when you teach him ‘sit’ as a puppy, continue to train him to ‘sit’ throughout his adult life and reward him each time he does so.


You can also be consistent by giving the same command, in the same tone of voice, for a specific action.
If you have other household members, make sure everyone uses the same commands so your poodle does not become confused with which command to follow. For example, if you say ‘stay,’ then other household members should not say something like ‘stay here.’

, Do not let your poodle think he can get away with not following your commands. If he is getting impatient or fussy during a training session, end the session and pick up where you left off during the next session. Your poodle will learn that misbehaving during one training session does not mean he is off the hook for learning the command."

Be patient.",How to Introduce Your Dog to Its New Home," If at all possible, put the dog's bed and toys, as well as its water and food dishes, inside the home before the dog gets there. This will let the dog know that this is its space now and it will be comforting to have familiar things and smells.Put the dog's items in locations that are similar to where they were in its old home. This will add to the dog's level of comfort.
Keep the dog's belongings. When you move to a new place you should not get the dog all new toys and a new bed. The things that the dog already has have its smells all over them and they will provide it with comfort during the adjustment period.;
, In order to make the house smell appealing to the dog, and override any smells that might be there from the last tenant, you can use a pheromone diffuser. Pheromone diffusers release a synthetic pheromone into the air that humans cannot smell but that mimics the comforting pheromones released by mother dogs when they have puppies.While pheromones don't work on all dogs, they are very helpful for calming a lot of dogs when they are stressed out.
Pheromone diffusers are available at most pet stores, online, and through your veterinary office.

, This will help the dog assess its new domain and establish the boundaries of its new home.


Have the dog go to the bathroom outside before it goes inside. This will help the dog establish its normal daily patterns at the new home quickly. If you have it go to the bathroom where you want it to go in the future, this will help that pattern occur reliably more quickly.

, It is a good idea to let the dog get to know its new home slowly. This will allow the dog to fully explore the whole place without getting overwhelmed or uneasy. Keep the dog on a leash when you bring it into the house. Let it sniff around one room at a time while you keep it on leash.Don't feel like you have to let the dog explore every room immediately. If the dog will mainly be in the living room and the kitchen, for example, just introduce those rooms and keep the rest of the home blocked off.
Once the dog has thoroughly sniffed the main areas, you can let it off lease. However, you should keep an eye on it for awhile to make sure it is behaving well in the new space.
Do not just let the dog run free around its new home. You don't want it getting too riled up and you want to keep normal boundaries and rules in place even at the new home.

, Don't change the dog's schedule completely just because you moved. Also, keep the rules the same. Don't change the rules just because you feel bad that the dog is having to adjust to a new home. If you can keep this stuff the same, this predictability will be a great comfort to the dog. For example:Feed the dog on the same schedule.
Walk the dog on the same schedule.
Go to bed at the same time.
Play with the dog in the same way and at the same time as you used to.
Don't allow new behaviors that weren't allowed before.

, It's important to let the dog know that it is still important to you, despite all the changes going on. Give it your usual level of attention but its always good to give it a little more just to show it that the new home is a good place that has new and exciting perks.If you are very busy due to the move and will not be able to give the dog your usual level of attention, then have someone else care for the dog while you are moving and putting things away in your new home. That way, when you actually bring the dog to its new home you can shower it with love and attention.

, It may take some time for your dog to adjust to its new surroundings. It may pace, bark, howl, or act strangely for awhile after the mover. Show it love, compassion, and understanding since the change was unexpected and happened abruptly for the dog.The dog could even begin to show behavioral problems that it never had before. If this is the case, you will need to work on the problem with training or with a professional dog behaviorist.
Some common behavioral problems that can occur when a dog moves include separation anxiety and territorial issues, among others.

Teach your Dachshund to heel.",How to Train Dachshunds," When you first bring your Dachshund puppy home, you may be excited to start working with him right away. However, he will need anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to get comfortable in your home before beginning training. Confine him to a small area first, such as a small bedroom, then gradually introduce him to your home’s other rooms.Keep a close eye on your puppy as he explores his environment. Puppy proof each room that you let him explore.
Puppy proofing involves removing or hiding electrical cords, keeping medications and household cleaners out of reach, and picking up children’s toys.;
, The earlier you start your training, the better. Begin training your Dachshund puppy when he is 8 to 12 weeks old. At around 8 weeks of age, your puppy will have been weaned from his mother, and he will be ready to start experiencing and interacting with the world around him., Puppy kindergarten will allow your puppy to learn how to socialize properly with other dogs. In addition, he will start to learn basic obedience skills in a playful environment, and you will learn how to communicate with him. Before deciding on a class, watch a few sessions to see how the trainer manages the puppies and discourages bullying.When your puppy becomes older, enroll him in an obedience class where he will learn some basic commands, like ’sit’ and ‘stay.’

As your puppy learns how to socialize with other dogs in class, you can also let him meet friendly new people when you take him out on walks. It is important for him to become comfortable with new experiences and people.

, When it comes to chewing, Dachshunds puppies are no different from other puppies—they love to chew! If you see him chewing on something he shouldn’t (e.g., shoes), say ‘No’ firmly and take the object away from him. Do not verbally or physically scold your puppy for inappropriate chewing. Rather than learning not to chew, he will just become fearful of you, which will make training that much more difficult.Say ‘No’ only if you see him in the act. If you say it after the fact, your puppy will not understand why you are correcting him.

, Crate training is an important aspect of training your Dachshund, especially when he is a puppy. Choose a crate that is large enough for comfortable movement, but not large enough for a separate bathroom space. An ideal crate size for Dachshunds is 24 by 30 inches (61 by 76 cm) or 24 by 36 inches (61 by 91 cm).Wire crates work well for Dachshunds, since they allow your Dachshund to see what’s going on around him., Dachshunds can get lonely, which could make crate training a challenge. Place your Dachshund’s crate in a room with a lot of human activity, such as the family room. Dachshunds crave companionship, so your Dachshund will enjoy being close to where you and your family spend your time.

, Ultimately, the crate should feel like a cozy safe haven for your Dachshund. Place comfortable bedding in the crate that already has his scent on it—this will make the crate feel like a familiar place. Put his other ‘creature comforts’ in the crate, such as his food and water bowls and puppy-safe toys.


Puppy-safe toys are available at your local pet store.
The crate should be a place of safety and comfort, not punishment., Throughout the crate training process, which can take at least a few weeks, you will be teaching your Dachshund to remain in the crate for increasing periods of time. Initially, entice him with treats to enter the crate. Then you can start feeding him his meals in the crate.Choose a 1-word command (e.g., ‘kennel’) to indicate when you want your Dachshund to enter the crate.Give him a treat whenever he enters the kennel so he can have a positive association with the crate.
Your Dachshund may whine or cry when you leave him in his crate. Do not give him attention when he does this. If you do, he will learn that whining or crying is a good way to get attention.
Do not crate your Dachshund all day and night. Not only will he not be able to hold his bladder for that long, constant crating will make him feel lonely and disconnected from you. Consider hiring a pet sitter to spend time with him during the day., Given their willful personalities, Dachshunds can be difficult to housetrain.Training your Dachshund to go to the bathroom outside is very important, though, so be patient with him as he learns where he should go potty. It may take at least several weeks to housetrain him properly.House training your Dachshund will be easier if you have already crate trained him., Whether your Dachshund is a puppy or an adult, he should be on a set schedule for eating and then going outside to use the bathroom. The schedule will reduce the likelihood of him eliminating in the house. For example, if you have a puppy, feed him 3 to 4 times a day and take him outside immediately after he finishes eating.Other recommended bathroom times for puppies are after playing, right before bedtime, and after spending time in the crate. A good rule of thumb to remember is that puppies, up to 9 to 12 months of age, can hold their bladder for 1 hour per month of age.Remain consistent with the eating and feeding schedules.

, When you take your Dachshund outside, let him choose the spot where he wants to eliminate. After he finishes, immediately reward him with a small treat and lots of verbal praise.Remain consistent with your praise so your Dachshund will understand that going to the bathroom outside is a good thing.Do not rush your Dachshund to potty outside (even if you are in a hurry). He may end up learning to hold it so he can spend more time with you, which will likely lead to accidents inside your home., Understandably, you may be upset and/or frustrated with your Dachshund if he urinates or defecates in your home. Rather than punish him after it has happened, clean up the mess without a fuss. Rubbing his nose in the soiled area is not effective—it will serve only to make your Dachshund afraid of you.To clean up the soiled area, use a cleaner that will eliminate the odor so your Dachshund does not go back to that same spot.If you catch him in the act of urinating or defecating in the house, give a him a firm ‘No,’ pick him up, and take him outside. Praise him when he finishes eliminating outside., Leash training your Dachshund may be challenging, since he is stubborn and has a natural instinct to chase. A well-fitting harness and leash, which you can purchase at your local pet store, will help you leash train him.Consider having the staff help you select a harness that will fit your Dachshund snugly without being too tight.


Allow your Dachshund to sniff and explore the harness and leash before you start using them.

, If you put the harness and leash on your Dachshund when he becomes excited about going out for a walk, you are actually teaching him a bad behavior—letting him to do what he wants to get your attention. When you see him become animated, drop the leash and harness and walk away. After he has calmed down, return to him and put the leash and harness on him.When you put on the leash and harness, hold the leash in your left hand and excess leash in your right hand., As excited as your Dachshund may be to go out for a walk, do not allow him to pull. This pulling can indicate an attempt to be the pack leader.If he begins pulling, either stand still or walk in the opposite direction.If you walk in the opposite direction, do not pull on the leash to get your Dachshund to follow you. Once you start walking the other way, he’ll eventually catch up to you.
Make sure you remain in front of your Dachshund during the walk to remind him that you are the pack leader.Consider giving your Dachshund treats during the walk when he is not pulling to reinforce good behavior., When your Dachshund knows how to heel, he will walk beside you without pulling. To teach this command, have him stand on your left side when you have his leash and harness on. Hold the leash in your left hand and a toy in your right hand. Cross your right hand over your body so he can see the toy. Say ‘heel’ and start walking forward, keeping your right hand positioned so he can see the toy.Instead of a toy, you could use a treat. Reward him with the treat or toy after about 20 to 30 seconds of him walking beside you properly.

Pick a new and unfamiliar setting.,
Start slowly.,
Stay calm.,
Walk the dogs together.",How to Introduce a Puppy to a Senior Dog1," Arrange to have your senior dog and new puppy meet on neutral ground, like a park or street that is not part of your regular walks or activities. This will prevent any territorial inclinations on the part of your grown dog. If you don’t want to travel too far, ask a neighbor if you can use their backyard or balcony., Ask a family member or friend to hold your puppy, either in their arms or on a leash. Lead your senior dog (also on a leash) towards the puppy and allow it to sniff the new dog on its own. Do not force your dog to approach the puppy. Make sure your friend holds the puppy firmly and allows your senior dog to sniff it first, before allowing the puppy to sniff the older dog., Dogs are very sensitive to their owners’ feelings and tend to reflect that in their behavior. Stay calm during the introduction to avoid having your dogs pick up on your anxiousness about the situation. Be reassuring and positive by offering praise and encouragement during the process., If your older dog demonstrates aggression or resistance during the introduction, break it up. Separate the dogs and allow them to calm down, give each dog a treat, and try a different approach. Take a walk around the neighborhood with both dogs, with the puppy walking behind your older dog. When your dog seems comfortable with the puppy being around, let the dogs interact again.While walking, do not allow your puppy to touch your senior dog.

Hide things.,
Time your arrival.,
Use scent as a guide.,
Monitor meal times.,
Encourage gradual bonding.,
Get help from an expert.",How to Introduce a Puppy to a Senior Dog2," Before bringing your new puppy home, hide items in the house that your puppy and senior dog could fight over. These objects could include food bowls, toys, dog blankets and beds, or bones. Make sure that you have two of everything to prevent such quarrels down the line., Bring your puppy home when your senior dog is out (e.g. for a walk, playing in the yard). This will minimize stress, which could be overwhelming for your senior dog. Allow your puppy to roam the house freely to get used to its new home during this time., Dogs rely heavily on their sense of smell, which is the best way for them to get to know each other and feel comfortable with one another. Keep your dogs separated but close so that they can get used to each other’s scent in their home environment without the risk of them fighting or posturing. Try keeping them in adjoining rooms, separated by a baby gate, or place your dogs in their crates, close enough to smell one another.To have your puppy and senior dog get used to each other’s scents without interacting, place “scent articles” like their blankets or toys in the other’s crate or bed.

, During the first couple of weeks, feed your dogs separately. Once you start feeding them together, monitor their meal time very carefully to watch for any signs of aggression. Place their food bowls a foot or two away so that neither dog tries to eat the other’s food or gets in the way of their eating., During the first week that your new puppy is home, bring it out for walks with your senior dog once or twice a day. Walking encourages bonding, so limit their overall interaction to this activity for this initial period.After about a month of supervised play and meals, correction and reward training, and structured walks, your senior dog should feel comfortable and know that the new puppy is not a threat. At this point you should be able to remove separators (e.g. a baby gate) and let the dogs co-habitate., If your dogs are not getting along in a peaceful way after a month of supervised interactions, look for a trainer to help with the problem. Visit the Association of Professional Dog Trainers website at https://apdt.com/trainer-search/ to find a trainer near you. Be sure to ask your prospective trainer several key questions before hiring them, such as:""What is your educational background?""
""How many years of experience do you have?""
""Do you have experience handling relationship-based issues between dogs?""
""What training methods do you use?""

"
"
Consult your veterinarian.,
Decide if your senior dog will accept a new puppy.,
Watching for signs of distress.",How to Introduce a Puppy to a Senior Dog3," Take your senior dog’s health into consideration before introducing it to a new puppy. If it has a chronic health condition (e.g. diabetes or hypothyroid disease) or impaired vision, a puppy’s energy might be too much for it to handle. Consult your veterinarian if you are uncertain about your senior dog’s health limitations., Take your senior dog’s interactions with other dogs as an indication of how it will deal with a puppy. If you dog interacts enthusiastically with other dogs and puppies while on its walks, for example, there is a very good chance it will adapt well to a new puppy. If your dog demonstrates fear or aggression towards other dogs, or has a tendency to get into fights with them, take this as a sign that it might not tolerate a boisterous puppy in its environment., Monitor all initial interactions between your dogs very carefully, watching for signal from your senior dog. Things like looking away from the puppy or moving to another part of the room are obvious signs that your dog needs a break from the interaction, and these signs should be considered before your dog gets aggressive.A less obvious sign would be your senior dog licking its lips or nose in an exaggerated manner, which is likely a signal that it is anxious or uncomfortable."
"
Teach it basic commands.,
Crate train your dog.,
Make sure your puppy gets exercise.",How to Introduce a Puppy to a Senior Dog4," Training your puppy is the best way to manage its behavior while it interacts with your senior dog. When your puppy is at least 12-16 weeks old, use the correction and reward method to teach it the five basic commands: ""Sit”,""Stay"", ""Lay down”, ”Heel”, and ""Come here”. Visit the American Kennel Club website at http://www.akc.org/content/dog-training/articles/teach-your-puppy-these-5-basic-commands/ to find instructions and videos on how to start this training.


Correction should never involve yelling or violence, but simply speaking firmly and clearly to your puppy.

, Crate training can be used to condition your puppy's behavior, to help with house training, to keep it from clashing with your senior dog while it adjusts to your home, and to offer it a safe place of its own. Introduce the crate to your puppy casually by leaving it open and unlocked, with toys and treats inside. Gradually work up to closing the door and leaving your puppy alone in the crate, rewarding it with praise and treats.Maintain happy associations with the crate throughout the training period as well as afterwards, when the crate can be kept as a “den” for your dog.

, To keep your puppy’s behavior from getting too restless or energetic around your senior dog, make sure it gets ample exercise at other times. Twice a day, your puppy should be doing 5 minutes of low-impact exercise for every month of age (for example, a four month old dog will need 20 minutes of exercise, two times a day). Low impact exercise may include short walks and chasing a ball in the backyard."

Take time off work to train your puppy.,
Start crate training as soon as you bring your pup home.,
Offer meals at the same times each day.,
Take your puppy out fifteen minutes after any activity.,
Take your puppy out at night.,
Choose a consistent potty area.,
Consider paper training your puppy.",How to Housebreak Shih Tzu Puppies1," From housebreaking to socialization, puppies require lots of training time. Take as much time off from work as you can when you first bring your new puppy home.In addition to needing training and supervision, young puppies have small bladders and haven’t fully developed the muscles that control when it goes to the bathroom. In order to prevent accidents, it’s best to take your puppy out every one to two hours.;
, Dogs are den animals, so they find enclosed spaces comforting. Start crate training your pup the day you bring it home. It’ll be less likely to go to the bathroom in the crate, but do your best not to leave your puppy crated for more than a couple hours.Choose a crate that’s just a bit larger than a full grown Shih Tzu. Your dog should be able to turn around, but a crate any larger won’t offer a sense of security.
Place toys and objects that smell like you in the crate so your dog develops positive associations with it.
Avoid using a crate as a punishment. It should be a source of safety and comfort, not a means of punishing your dog.

, Sticking to regular mealtimes will help you potty train your puppy and avoid accidents as it matures. In general, you should choose a brand of food marked for small breed puppies and offer morning and evening servings of 1/4 to 1/2 a cup (60 to 120 g). Your puppy’s vet will help you decide how much food to feed your puppy., Puppies need to be let out frequently, especially smaller breed pups. Follow a fifteen minute rule when scheduling times to take your puppy out to potty. Take it to its potty area fifteen minutes after each meal, after playing, or after waking up from naps.In addition to following the fifteen minute rule, you should make sure your pup gets to its potty area every couple hours during the daytime.

, You’ll need to take your puppy out at least once or twice at night in order to avoid accidents. Set your alarm, get out of bed, and take your pup to its potty spot.Try to avoid playing or making overnight potty trips exciting in any way. Make it matter of fact and calm so your pup doesn’t think it’s playtime., Dogs instinctively like to mark one spot consistently. Designate one potty area when you start training so your pup understands where it’s appropriate to go to the bathroom.Your designated area could be an indoor potty pad or spot outside, but try to use pads in combination with outdoor training. Relying on pads alone makes it difficult to get your dog to go to the bathroom in unfamiliar locations in the future, for example when you’re at a friend’s home or on a trip., Training your puppy to use a potty pad or newspaper can be helpful if you live in a high rise or cold, snowy environment.However, keep in mind pads typically make the housebreaking process more complicated. You can start your puppy out by taking it to its pad to potty, but you should gradually incorporate outdoor training.When you want to start getting your pup used to going to the bathroom outside, start bringing the potty pad closer to your home’s exit. Then, if possible, position the pad just outside of your door or in a designated potty area outside. Once your pup gets used to pottying on the pad outside, remove it. Give it a “Go potty!” command when you take it outside and want it to go to the bathroom.

Choosing a crate that is too large will give the pup enough room to defecate on one side and sleep on the other side. You can either opt for a plastic dog crate such as this, which is easy to clean or a wire crate, which allows your dog to see his environment. If the need arises, the wire crate can be covered with a blanket or towel to make your pup feel safe.;
, To make the crate comfortable and cozy, you need to add some bedding to it. Avoid using newspaper, as it may send the wrong signal to the pup that it can eliminate on the newspaper, especially if that’s how the dog was previously trained to relieve himself. Use a towel or soft blanket instead, and if the pup soils it don’t provide any bedding until he/she understands that it’s meant for sleeping and not for eliminating.

, Dogs are social animals and should not be left alone for long periods, especially puppies, who have always been in the company of their mother or siblings since birth. Therefore, it’s important to place the crate right beside your bed at night during the initial days. Make sure the crate is placed close enough for you to comfort the pup with your fingers if need arises.

, It’s very important that you introduce the crate to your pup in a positive way. Start by tossing small treats in the crate; in order to get these treats your dog will go inside. Once you feel he/she is comfortable in the crate, shut the door for few minutes and offer treats through the door, then allow him/her to come out. Slowly use this technique to feed his regular meals, this way he/she will associate with the crate as a pleasurable place.

, Make it a habit to keep the pup in the crate or kennel whenever he/she is not under your supervision. This way you won’t allow an accident to take place, thereby preventing potty mistakes. This habit will also help your pup understand the concept of house breaking faster.

, Pups are prone to developing fear of being alone; if possible keep the radio or TV on and at a low volume in the room where you’ve placed the crate. If you are going to be away for the whole day, request your neighbor or friend to take your pup for a walk, or if possible hire a dog-sitter.

, Each time the pup is taken out of the crate, immediately bring it to the potty area, even if he/she was in the crate for as little as 15 minutes.

, As soon as you reach the potty area, put your pup down or relax the leash if he/she is on leash, and say something like “do your business” or “go potty.”

, Use the phrase once again, this time softly, when you see that the pup is actually trying to find a spot to relieve himself. Control your excitement and don’t be loud, as this can distract your pup from the task at hand.

, Be consistent throughout the training, whether it’s the feeding and exercise schedule, potty area and phrase or the door through which you take him out. Sometimes, your pup will give you signals if he/she wants to relieve himself/herself again, such as drinking a lot of water, sniffing around, circling, wandering, looking at the door, whining, etc. Take them out without any delay.

, Some dogs have the habit of pooping twice or at two different places in one outing. So make sure the walk is long and you don’t have to rush him out again. Active dogs that are usually playing get thirsty more often, and drinking water at regular intervals also means they will have to be taken out to eliminate more often.

, Last but not the least, reward your pup with a quick walk once he has relieved himself. Putting him back in the crate immediately will take all the fun away and your pup might adopt unwanted habits just to stay out for a bit longer or to enjoy your company.

, When potty training accidents occur, clean the surface with an enzymatic cleaner. Make sure your pup is out of sight when cleaning, to avoid unintentional punishment. Never scold your pet for a crate accident, because they won’t have the slightest idea what they did wrong. Any accident that occurs during the training period is your responsibility and punishing your pet for it can have a negative impact on him/her.

Set aside some time.,
Tether your dog.,
Confine your dog.,
Watch for signs.,
Take your dog out.",How to House Train Your Dog in Less than a Week1," In order for this process to work—especially for it to work in one week--someone must be home with your dog all day and night. Closely supervising your dog is the most efficient and effective way to housetrain it. Try to take some time off work, and/or work together with another household member to tag-team supervision.A dog 3-6 months old will respond best to this method of week long conditioning.
An older dog may need more than 7 days to embrace the new schedule and adjust to housetraining.;
, Once again, you are going to need to watch your dog closely during this process. Anytime you are not playing with or feeding your dog, consider tethering it close to you. Your dog’s freedom at home is an honor that has to be earned by it reliably controlling its potty behaviors.In general, a 4-6 foot long leash will work for this purpose.


Attach a leash to your belt.
Attach a leash to something nearby, where you can see your dog the whole time.

, If you must walk away (or if tethering is not an option for you), consider confining your dog to a kitchen or bathroom. To reiterate, you must closely supervise your dog all day long in order for this process to work.



Crate training is another option.
Choose a crate that is large enough for your dog to turn around while inside, and lie down in.
Avoid leaving your dog alone and confined for long periods of time. Three hours should be the absolute max.

, You are watching your dog for two reasons: to prevent accidents in the house, and to learn to recognize your dog’s “bathroom signs.” You must recognize when it needs to go outside and take it promptly. You may also begin to notice a pattern for when it needs to go.Use your notebook to keep track of your dog's patterns and signs. Look for behaviors like:


Whining
Sniffing the ground
Scratching or pawing the ground
Walking around in a circle

, Anytime you see your dog exhibiting ""potty"" signs, stop what you're doing and take the dog out. Bring it to the same location each time and allow some time for it to go.


When it successfully goes potty in the correct spot, provide a treat, praise, and affection.
Take note of what time of day and/or what was happening (e.g., did the dog just eat) when it needed to go out.

"
"
Praise the dog.,
Provide a treat.,
Touch the dog lovingly.,
Time the reward correctly.,
Continue providing rewards.",How to Housebreak a Dog with Positive Reinforcement1," The key to using positive reinforcement is to provide something positive any time the dog achieves the proper behavior. Every time your dog uses the potty spot, you can praise them with kind words. It is crucial for praise to come immediately after the dog goes potty.You might say:


""Good job going potty!""
""Good dog!""
""Good pee!"";
, Beyond just kind words, you can positively reinforce good potty behavior by providing a treat any time your dog uses the potty spot correctly. Select a food-based treat that your dog enjoys and that is suitable for their size.Dog treats can be purchased at:


Pet stores
Grocery stores
Through your vet
Online

, Another way to reward your dog for appropriate potty behavior and provide positive reinforcement is to touch your dog lovingly as a form of praise. Make strong eye contact with your dog as your pet them or give them a big hug.You might:


Scratch the dog's head
Pet the dog's back
Pat them lightly

, In order for these rewards to function properly as positive reinforcement, you must time them correctly. Keep some dog treats in your pocket when you take them outside. As soon as they have finished going potty, reward your dog with a combination of:


Treats
Kind words
Physical affection

, In order for your dog's appropriate potty behavior to become an ingrained habit, you have to continually reinforce it. Even after your dog appears to be fully potty-trained, continue to provide praise, loving pats, and sometimes even food treats to keep them motivated and further reinforce good behavior."

If it's too big, your dog will have space to use the bathroom in the crate and still have a clean area. It should be big enough for your dog to sit up, stand up, lay down, and turn around, but no bigger.Part of the reason crate training works is because your dog doesn't like to sleep where they've used the bathroom. Therefore, getting a crate that's not too big helps prevent your dog from going to the bathroom in it.;
, A soft blanket or even a towel on the bottom of the crate helps make it more comfortable. You can also add a few toys your dog likes, so it has something to entertain itself with while it is in the crate., Placing the crate in a busy area will help your dog feel more comfortable with being in the crate. Therefore, when placing the crate, it's a good idea to choose a location where your family will often be., Call your dog over. Begin by dropping treats near the crate. Keep dropping treats, moving closer to the crate as you do. Speak in a happy tone to your dog, saying things such as ""Good dog!"" Drop some treats inside the crate to encourage your dog to go in.Make sure the door is fastened open so it won't scare your dog by hitting it.
Keep working with your dog until you can get it to go all the way in the crate. This process could take a few days.

, You want your dog to be able to go in the crate when you give a voice command. Choose one for your dog to learn. The command is up to you; it can be ""kennel,"" ""bed,"" ""crate,"" or even ""go home."" As long as you're consistent, it shouldn't matter. When your dog starts going in the kennel regularly, you can use the command as it goes in to begin getting it accustomed to cue., If your dog is still hesitant, place the food dish just inside the crate so that your dog doesn't need to go all the way in to eat. As the dog grows more accustomed to it, move the food bowl further and further back each time, so eventually your dog is all the way in the crate while eating.Once your dog is going all the way in, try shutting the door just while the dog is eating. When it's done, open the crate.

, Once your dog is accustomed to being crated during meals, try leaving the dog in there for a few minutes after it eats, increasing to about 10 minutes over several days. Your dog may whine. If it does, you may have increased too quickly. However, make sure you wait until the dog stops whining to let it out. Otherwise, it learns it can cry to be let out., Once your dog is not whining to be let out after meals, try crating the dog at other times. Call the dog over with a treat, and shut the dog in. Sit near the dog, but don't make noise. Start with about 10 minutes and gradually work up to 30 minutes or so.You can also leave the room for a short period after sitting for a few minutes. Make sure you don't leave the dog inside too long., If your dog isn't crying and whining for the short periods you leave it in the crate, work on crating the dog while you're in the house but not in the room. If you can leave it for 30 minutes to an hour, you can start trying out-of-the-house excursions, though keep them short at first.For bedtime, try making the process easier by moving the crate to your room. Otherwise, the dog may think the crate is a punishment (being away from you). As the dog gets more comfortable, you can move it somewhere else., A puppy, especially, needs to go out regularly, but an older dog can benefit from a schedule, too, if you're trying to housebreak it. Try taking the dog out at least every two hours, but also when the dog wakes up, before it goes to bed, after eating or drinking, and after (or while) playing. Also, take the dog out after it has been in the crate for a while.Consider the dog's age when setting a schedule. House training a puppy is vastly different from house training a dog. The main difference is a dog can be expected to hold their bladder longer than a puppy. To calculate how long your puppy should be able to hold it, use an hour per month. Therefore, a two-month-old can likely hold it for two hours. However, no dog should be expected to hold it longer than nine to ten hours (overnight).Also, set a consistent schedule for feeding. If the dog's food is consistent, they're more likely to use the bathroom at consistent times each day.

, While you are housebreaking the dog, it's important to supervise them as much as possible. If you can watch the dog, put it on a leash near you, tethered to a piece of furniture, so you can watch for bathroom cues. If you need to be busy, you can keep the dog in the crate if you've started working on crate training.If you can't supervise the dog and it's not ready for the crate, put the dog in a safe area, such as a tiled laundry room. Make sure to remove things like chemicals, plants, and other unsafe items the dog can chew. Try to make the area as small as possible, so your dog is less likely to go to the bathroom.

, Take your dog outside on a leash. As you do, pick a bathroom cue word, such as ""pee,"" ""bathroom,"" or even ""outside."" Outside, pick one place in your yard that you take your dog for using the bathroom, so they know that's where they need to go each time. Use the cue word while they are going to the bathroom.Take the dog out to the bathroom before you take them on a walk, at least while training, so they know where they need to go.

, When you take your dog outside to use the bathroom, praise it extravagantly when it does. You can offer a treat, but also pet it, and use a happy, excited voice to let the dog know what a good job it's done.Unless you catch your dog in the act, you won't be able to do anything about mistakes. If you do catch your dog using the bathroom inside, make a noise to startle it into stopping. Pick it up, and take it outside to finish going to the bathroom.

, Every dog is a little different, but as you start training your dog to go outside, you'll start to notice things it does when it wants to go out. It may bark, scratch at the door, squat, grow restless, or circle. If you see your dog doing these things, take it outside."

Praise your puppy as soon as it potties correctly.,
Incorporate a verbal command.,
Supervise your dog closely for at least four to eight weeks.",How to Housebreak Shih Tzu Puppies2," Rewarding your puppy with exaggerated praise and food treats will help it form a positive association with correct bathroom behavior. You must offer rewards immediately when it starts to go to the bathroom so it makes the connection between the reward and going to the bathroom.Keep tiny pieces of a treat less than the size of a pea on hand when you take your puppy out to potty. If you wait to treat it when you’re back inside, it won’t understand that the reward was for going to the bathroom correctly.

, As your puppy starts getting used to pottying in the appropriate area, start to incorporate a “Go potty!” command. Say the command when you arrive at the potty spot, and be sure to reward it when it potties. Over time, your puppy will associate the command with pottying and being rewarded.A “Go Potty” command will help you get your dog to use the bathroom in unfamiliar locations in the future.
Other than giving a verbal potty command, avoid unnecessary distractions, like games or talking., You should keep a close eye on your pup when it’s indoors during potty training until it’s gone four to eight weeks without an accident. That way, you’ll have the best chance of interrupting an accident the moment it happens.Keeping your puppy in a particular area instead of allowing it to access your entire home will help you keep an eye on it. When it’s not in its crate, keep doors closed or try using sturdy baby gates keep areas off limits.

A two month old puppy can wait two hours
A three month old puppy can wait three hours.
Most adult dogs can wait up to five or six hours.

, In order to housetrain your dog, you need to get your dog on a consistent schedule. Dog’s are pack animals. They like to be given clear boundaries and thrive on routine. Determine times for eating, bathroom, and play.Aim for bathroom breaks every three hours.
Provide food and water 30 minutes before a scheduled bathroom break.
After each potty break, spend 30 minutes playing, followed by about 2 hours of crate, tethering, or confinement.

Provide treats.,
Provide praise.,
Avoid punishment.,
Clean any accidents right away.",How to House Train Your Dog in Less than a Week3," Whenever your dog does potty in the right spot, you should reward it! One way to do this is to provide a dog treat. It is important to give the treat right away so your dog associates the treat with the action, so consider keeping a treat in your pocket., When your dog goes potty in the bathroom spot, you can also reward your dog with praise! Scratch its head, speak kind words, and let it know that you are happy., Accidents are probably going to happen. However, yelling, spanking, or rubbing your dog’s nose in it is not the best practice. This creates a negative association with going to the bathroom that you want to avoid.When you catch your dog in the act:


Interrupt without yelling. You may express a firm “Oops!”
Don’t use an angry tone.
Immediately take it to the designated toilet spot.
If it goes potty in the designated spot, provide praise and a treat.

, Use an enzymatic cleaner to clean up any accidents. Look for one specifically formulated for pet stains and odors. This prevents your dog from going potty in these spots again.


Look for such cleaners at pet stores or online.
One good brand is Nature’s Miracle.

"
Stick to a schedule.,
Choose a ""potty spot."",
Supervise your dog.",How to Housebreak a Dog with Positive Reinforcement2," The first step in housetraining your dog with positive reinforcement is to create a schedule that you can stick to. This schedule should dictate when your dog eats, goes outside, and plays.Feed your dog at the same time each morning and night.
Take your dog outside 20-30 minutes after each feeding.
Schedule 2-3 additional potty trips each day (older dogs can generally wait longer than puppies).
Schedule a time for physical activity and play.

, Another important aspect of creating a solid routine involves selecting a ""potty spot"" for your dog. If you always bring your dog to the same specific spot at bathroom time, they will better understand this is the time to go potty, and not a time to play.Select an area that is:


Close to your house
Grass or soil
Specific

, While you are in the process of potty training your dog, it is crucial to supervise them at all times. If there are brief periods of time (2-3 hours max) that you cannot supervise your dog, you must confine them to a crate or one room of your house (such as the kitchen).It may help for you to:


Tether the dog to you with a leash (especially if it is a puppy).
Enlist friends or family members to help with supervision.

"
Check the time.,
Watch for potty behaviors.,
Bring your dog to the special spot.,
Wait for them to go potty.,
Provide immediate praise.",How to Housebreak a Dog with Positive Reinforcement3," Hopefully you will have established an eating and going potty schedule for your dog. Make it a habit of checking the clock or set reminders on your phone. When it is time to go potty, promptly take your dog out., In addition to sticking to your potty schedule, sometimes your dog may need an extra trip. Watch out for your dog giving signals that they need to go potty in order to prevent accidents at home.Your dog might:


Whine
Sniff the ground
Scratch or paw the ground
Walk around in a circle

, When it is time to go potty (or if your dog is exhibiting signs) take your dog to the special ""potty spot"" you have chosen. Remember, this is a potty trip, not a play trip, so go directly to the spot., Your dog may need a little time to work up the urge to go potty, but at the same time, you don't want to be waiting all day. Establish the length of time you will wait--10 to 15 minutes is a good average--and then wait with your dog., As soon as your dog goes potty in the correct spot, praise them verbally, touch them lovingly and provide a yummy treat. Then take your dog back "
"
Avoid punishing the dog.,
Speak in a calm, but firm tone.,
Clean the area thoroughly.",How to Housebreak a Dog with Positive Reinforcement4," Positive reinforcement does not rely on a system of punishment or fear. If your dog should have an accident, do not yell, physically harm, or otherwise punish the dog. Instead, think about why the accident may have occurred.Perhaps the dog cannot wait as long to use the potty.
Perhaps the dog had additional food or drink.

, If you catch the dog in the act of going potty inside, speak in a firm voice (or make a loud noise) that interrupts the action, and take the dog outside immediately.You might say, ""Outside!""
You could also clap your hands or make another loud noise.

, If your dog should have an accident on the floor, it is crucial to clean this area thoroughly. Any remaining scent could encourage your dog to go potty in the same location again.Clean the area with hot water and detergent.
Follow with an enzyme-based cleaner created specifically for pet accidents (available at pet stores and online).

Interrupt accidents immediately.,
Avoid punishing your puppy after an accident you didn’t catch.,
Clean up accidents as soon as possible.,
Try not to let your puppy lay in an accident.",How to Housebreak Shih Tzu Puppies3," Be patient with housebreaking and expect your puppy to have accidents. If you see an accident in progress, get your pup’s attention by saying “Oops!” or No, no!” Pick the puppy up, and take it to a designated potty area, whether it’s a paper pad or spot outside.Try not to yell or scare your puppy when you interrupt an accident. It might become afraid to go to the bathroom in front of people, making the housebreaking process much more difficult.  

, If you come home to find an accident or didn’t see the accident happen, don’t rub your dog’s nose in it or otherwise punish it. Even if only a couple minutes have passed, just clean it up without any fuss. Dogs, especially puppies with short attention spans, can’t understand the connection between a punishment and the accident., Use an enzymatic cleaner that removes pet odors to deal with accident spots. You can find a cleaner at your local pet store. If you don’t remove scent traces, your dog will smell previous accidents and want to mark there again., It’s vital that your puppy doesn’t get used to being around its mess. Dogs are instinctively clean and don’t like to be around their excrement. However, if you leave a puppy in its crate for too long, it’ll have to go inside and, over time, might become accustomed to unsanitary conditions.It if gets used to being in its mess, you’ll have a lot more trouble housebreaking it effectively. Be sure not to leave your puppy in its crate for more than two hours, and clean up any accidents as soon as you see them.

Cover the slippery area.,
Give your dog a safe path.,
Use a different cleaner or floor finish.,
Put in different floors or refinish them.,
Trim the dog's nails.,
Put booties or grips on the dog.,
Use a paw wax.,
Assess whether the floor is a risk to your dog's health.,
Don't force the dog on to slippery floors.,
Help the dog relax.,
Feed the dog on the slippery floor.",How to Help Your Older Dog Navigate Slippery Floors," The easiest way to help your older dog navigate slippery floors is to cover them up. Use area rugs to cover up the area without having to change out the floors or refinish them.When you place area rugs on slippery floors you need to use a non-slip rug pad between the rug and the floor or you need to get a rug that has a rubberized bottom so that it won't move around. This will help your dog, and you, from slipping and sliding when you step on to the rug.;
, If you cannot cover up the entire slippery area, consider at least giving your dog a safe path through the area. Use small rugs or runners that have a rubber backing or non-slip pad, or use a plastic or vinyl runner in an area where items on the floor need to be easily cleaned.For example, if the kitchen floor is too slippery for your dog, consider using a line of kitchen mats that are easily cleaned to give your dog a safe path. They will help your dog navigate the area at the same time as minimizing the difficulty of cleaning rugs that get kitchen messiness on them.

, Sometimes the cleaner or finish you use on floors can add to their slipperiness. For example, if you have been waxing your floors, consider using a different type of cleaner that will not promote such a slippery surface.


To figure out if a different type of cleaner will be less slippery, you will probably need to do some tests. When you run out of your regular cleaner or floor finish, try buying a different product that you suspect will be less slippery for your dog.
There are some floor cleaners that are marked as ""slip resistant."" These products may help to reduce the danger for your older dog., If your dog is having a really hard time walking on your floors, you do have the option of putting in different floors. This is an extreme solution to the problem of slippery floors but if you are considering getting new floors anyway, this could be the way to go.


The least slippery option for an older dog is wall-to-wall carpet.
There are even floor coatings that you can apply that are made to prevent slipping. These are often vinyl coatings. Make sure that you test any products you want to apply to your floors in an inconspicuous spot before applying it in the main area of your floor., Make sure that your dog's nails are trimmed short so that the dog is not resting on the slippery points of nails. These are slippery and can diminish your dog's ability to get a grip on slippery floors.You will also want to trim any fur that has grown onto the bottom area of the paws. Fur that is covering up your dog's paw pads will make it's pads more slippery.

, Dogs with hip dysplasia or arthritis may risk serious injury if they slip and fall. To avoid this you can put non-slip foot coverings on your dog.In a pinch, you can place non-skid baby socks on your dog's paws to stop the slipping., There are some products sold that can be applied directly on to dog's pads. Products such as paw wax give the dog more traction by making the pads have more friction.Search for products like this in your local pet store or online.
Make sure any product you use is non-toxic to your dog. Your dog is likely to try and lick the substance off, so whatever you use should not hurt the dog if ingested.

, If your dog is afraid of an area of floor you should decide whether the fear is actually a problem or if the problem is just in your dog's head. If you have ever seen the dog slip on the flooring, then the slipperiness does need to be fixed. However, if your dog is still steady on its feet and you have not seen it slip, then it may be worth a try to train your dog to overcome its fear.


Older dogs can have a variety of health problems that can make them precarious on their paws. If your dog has arthritis or problems with its joints, it may not be a good idea to try and coax it on to flooring it fears. That fear may be well founded., It will not help your dog to force it into a situation it doesn't want to go in to. This has a risk of making the dog even more afraid of the slippery floors than it already was.Forcing a dog into a situation it sees as dangerous could also impact your relationship with that dog. If you push it in to a bad situation, the dog may not trust you as much or may even have an aggressive response toward you.

, Some of the problems associated with slippery floors stem from the anxiety that they cause.In order to get your dog to overcome its fear you need to make it calm before trying to coax it on to the floor.


There are a wide variety of ways to make a dog calm. These can include petting it, talking to it in a calm voice, or giving it a treat that it loves.
Exercising your dog can also make it calm. Try taking your dog for a long walk before trying to train it to walk on a floor surface it fears.

, Food can be a great motivator for dogs that are scared of slippery floors. Give your dog its meals at the center of the floor or place a food puzzle in the middle of the floor. Just be sure that the food bowl or the food puzzle is secured to the floor so that it doesn't move.Securing the food bowl or puzzle to the floor will assure that your dog doesn't move it off the slippery floor the first chance it gets.

Change the mat often, but leave a little spot of dried urine there.,
Reward your dog for going in the spot.",How to House Train Your Dog," This is the most important thing you can do to teach your dog to relieve himself outside. While it may seem excessive, try to take him outside as frequently as possible, about every half an hour. Stick to a schedule and try not to miss even one designated ""outside time,"" since your dog will learn to associate these outside trips with relieving himself.If you're training a puppy, you'll need to take him outside more frequently. Puppies have small bladders and can't physically hold their pee for long periods of time.;
, Feed your dog at the same time in the morning and at night, then wait 20 to 30 minutes before taking him outside. Having a feeding schedule will make it easier to predict when your dog will have to go to the bathroom, making house training easier.


Puppies need to be fed three times a day. If you have a puppy, schedule a regular lunchtime feeding as well. Again, a puppy should be given more opportunities to go outside, since it has a smaller bladder.

, Signs include walking around stiffly, sniffing the floor as though he's looking for a place to go, holding his tail in a funny position, and so on. If your dog shows signs that he needs to go to the bathroom, take him outside right away, even if it's before the designated time to go out.Include a verbal cue, such as saying, ""outside"" before you take him out. Eventually, you'll be able to ask him if he needs to go outside, simply by saying the word.When you first start training your dog to go outside, you're teaching him that when he feels the urge, that means it's time to go outside. Each time your dog successfully goes outside, the idea that bathroom = outside is reinforced.
Remember to take your dog outside 20 to 30 minutes after every meal and after he drinks water, since he'll likely have to go to the bathroom.

, Choose in your backyard, or if you don't have one, near a green patch of grass somewhere. Take your dog back to the same place each and every time you go outside. Dogs are creatures of habit. You can help your dog feel comfortable and less anxious by picking a good spot for him to use as his ""bathroom"" each time he goes out. Use a verbal cue such as, ""go potty"" when you've reached the spot. He'll learn to associate it with the place.Remember to follow your city's ordinances regarding picking up after your pet. If you have no choice but to let your dog use a public spot as his bathroom, you'll need to bring a bag so you can pick up the waste and dispose of it.

, When you first bring your dog or puppy home, plan to spend a lot of time watching your pet to make sure he doesn't go to the bathroom indoors. This supervisory period is imperative because it enables you to teach the dog to quickly associate the urge to pee or poop with going outside. Intercepting the dog or puppy before he goes in the house is the best way to house train quickly.If you can't stay home all day to supervise your dog, you'll need to have someone else come over to take the dog out several times during the day. Make sure the person knows to take the dog to the designated spot each time.

, If you leave your dog or puppy free to roam the house at night, he's sure to end up soiling the floor. Keeping him in a cozy crate at night and when you're gone reduces the chance that he'll make a mess. Dogs don't like to soil their dens, so your dog will try to wait until he can go outside to relieve himself.


Dogs should see their crates as safe spaces and enjoy spending time there. Keeping your dog in a crate is not meant to be a form of punishment. Never punish your dog by banishing him to the crate, or he'll come to associate it with fear instead of comfort.
Do not let your dog stay in his crate for too long before taking him outside. If you wait too long, he'll have no choice but to relieve himself in the crate. Dogs need plenty of exercise and playtime too, so you should never leave them crated for more than a few hours at a time or overnight.

, If your dog makes a mess in the house (and he definitely will), clean it up right away and use a cleaning solution to get rid of the scent. If your dog smells an old mess in a certain spot, he'll think of that as a bathroom spot.


Do not punish the dog for making a mess. Just clean it up and stick to the schedule.

, Dogs learn best through positive reinforcement and they quickly learn the best way to get it. Every time your dog is able to go to the bathroom in his designated spot, reward him with a little treat, lots of praise, and a scratch on the head.Be consistent when it comes to rewarding your dog. Do it every single time he goes to the bathroom in the bathroom spot.
You can of course reward your dog for other things, like learning how to sit and stay. All good behavior should be rewarded.

, When you're treating your dog for going to the bathroom in his spot, give him a treat and praise right after he finishes relieving himself. Don't give it too early or too late, or he won't associate it with going to the bathroom in the right spot.

, Some people have had success using the bell method instead of a treat. When your dog goes to the bathroom in his spot, you ring a bell or pleasant-sounding chime to as part of his reward. The dog will come to look forward to the sound of the chime, which should only be used in this specific situation.


The drawback here is that eventually you won't want to keep using a chime or bell every time your dog goes to the bathroom. Initially phasing it out might be confusing to the dog.

, Whenever you're taking your dog to the bathroom or talking about it, keep your voice light and pleasant. Never raise your voice or take on a menacing tone, because your dog will start to associate his bodily functions with punishment and fear. If your dog makes a mess inside, you can withhold praise, but don't yell at the dog or make him feel ashamed.


If using verbal cues, such as ""outside"", ""go potty"", or ""good dog"" be consistent. The repetition of these words along with the action and environment will reinforce where you want your dog to relieve himself.

, Dogs don't respond well to punishment. It scares them and instead of learning to perform well for you, they learn to fear you. Never yell, hit, or do anything that could cause your dog to feel afraid.


Do not rub your dog's face in his mess. Contrary to some beliefs, this does not teach a dog not to go to the bathroom in the house. The dog will not understand what you're doing and you'll just end up scaring him.

, If you live in a high rise, you won't be able to make it outside every time your dog needs to go to the bathroom. Pick a spot in your apartment that isn't right in the middle of your living space, but is also easy for your dog to access at any time. A corner of the laundry room or kitchen works well. Choose a spot on hardwood or vinyl flooring, rather than carpet., Newspaper is a cheap material you can use to create a bathroom mat for your dog. Absorbent training pads are also available in pet stores. Choose the option that's most convenient for your household.


You could also use a dog litter tray. If you'll also take your dog outside to relieve himself, consider filling the tray with soil. This way, the dog will learn that it's acceptable to relieve itself outdoors and indoors.
Be aware that your dog may get used to only relieving himself on newspaper, if that's all that you put down.

, Take your dog to the bathroom mat on a strict schedule, just as you would if you were training your dog to go to a spot outside. Frequently walk him to the mat throughout the day and each time he shows signs of needing to relieve himself.

, The scent of the urine will help your dog remember that the mat is the place to go to the bathroom. Remove feces right away, but leave a sheet of newspaper or a small bit of padding with urine on the clean mat so your dog will naturally know where to go.

, Each time he successfully goes on the mat, reward him with a treat, petting and praise. He'll eventually come to associate going to the bathroom on the mat with positive feelings, and he'll start going there without your help before too long.

Ask your vet about anxiety medication.",How to House Train an Older Dog," If you have recently adopted or purchased the dog, call the source and find out as much as you can about the dog's previous habits and upbringing. It is helpful to know if the dog was partially house-trained in the past. It is also helpful to know if the dog was confined for long periods of time in a particular environment (exclusively outdoors, on a concrete floor at a shelter, in a kennel, etc.) as this can cause surface preferences that you may need to overcome.;
, If your dog was house-trained and has just recently begun urinating or defecating in the house, or if it is a new dog that seems to have some bad habits, it is important to see your vet and rule out any medical problems before attempting a behavioral intervention. Your dog may be suffering from kidney problems, gastrointestinal distress, age-related incontinence, or some other treatable condition.Be sure to let the vet know about any dietary or environmental changes your dog has recently experienced, including change of food, schedule, and the addition or removal of people or animals living in the home.
Your vet can also help you isolate and begin treating any special behavioral problems that might be causing your dog's accidents, including a fear of the outdoors, separation anxiety, etc.

, Figuring out where the dog is doing its business and when can help you isolate problem situations and avoid them in the future. If your dog only pees on linoleum floors, for example, you can begin by restricting access to rooms with linoleum, or temporarily putting rugs or towels down on those surfaces to discourage the behavior while you work on teaching your dog new habits., It is important to thoroughly remove pet waste odors from previous accidents to break the association between indoors and waste elimination. Use an enzymatic cleaner (available at any pet store) that has been specially formulated to destroy pet waste odors. You may also need to use a handheld backlight to look for hidden messes in closets, behind doors, etc.

, Many experts recommend taking several days off work to establish a consistent routine and house train your dog in one go. Most adult dogs learn more quickly than puppies, and can be successfully house trained in less than seven days., It is important to teach your dog to use a specific location to eliminate waste. The location should be outdoors, not too distant from your home, and if possible, sheltered from wind and rain (for instance, under a specific tree).


If you live in a high-rise apartment, or have mobility issues that prevent you from taking your dog outside, you may need to train your dog to use papers or a litter box., Even if the dog was already partially house trained, and you were accustomed to just letting her out, it is important for the retraining process that you actually take her to the desired location, and make sure that she is using it.

, Take your dog outside frequently, beginning when the dog first wakes up, and then every two hours at first. When you get to the elimination area, use your preferred command to indicate that you want the dog to eliminate waste: for example ""go potty"" or ""do your business."" Immediately after the dog urinates or defecates, give her a treat and tell her ""good dog.""


Do not wait until you get inside to offer the treat, or you will fail to create the proper connection between using the desired behavior and the reward.
Most healthy adult dogs only really need to go a few hours per day, but you want to take your dog out frequently at first to find out when those times are and avoid accidents.
Once you figure out your dog's routine, you can schedule outings specifically around those times.

, The more regularly your dog is fed, the more regularly she will poop. Feed your dog the amount and type of food recommended for her age and weight at regular intervals throughout the day. Most experts recommend feeding adult dogs twice per day. Consult with your vet for specific recommendations for your dog., If your dog is peeing indoors at night, the problem might be too much water before bedtime. Check with your veterinarian to see if putting the water dish away a few hours before bedtime will be helpful. Always check with your vet before withholding water. Older dogs with subclinical kidney disease (in the very early stages) can deteriorate rapidly if water is withheld. Your vet may request a urine sample, to help determine if you dog is in this risk category.Don't restrict your dog's water intake if it is hot, or if your dog gets a lot of exercise.

, Not all dogs give obvious clues when they need to eliminate waste. Pay attention to behaviors like whining, pacing, sniffing, circling, or leaving the room to hide. If you see these behaviors, quickly take your dog outside to the elimination area., If you catch your dog midstream, simply clap your hands loudly to startle her. Then quickly carry or escort her outside to where you do want her to go to the bathroom, and encourage her to complete her business. Then reward her when she does so successfully.Punishing your dog for accidents is an ineffective approach to house training, and could cause the dog anxiety and make the situation worse instead of better.

, If your dog is having accidents when you are not around, the best approach might be to crate train her or confine her to a small room when you must be away. Dogs do not like to soil their living quarters, and are less likely to make a mess in the house if they can't get to a preferred spot to do so., You may be able to reduce the frequency of your trips outside, but the ritual of escorting your dog to the elimination site, instructing her to go, and rewarding her when she does so successfully, should be continued for at least two weeks to cement the behavior. Eventually your dog will learn to use the desired location naturally, but the longer you continue the training process, the more likely it is to stick.The dog's feeding and exercise schedule should remain regular all the time.

, Sometimes a dog has behavioral problems beyond a lack of training. If a week of consistent elimination training fails to help you and your dog, it is time to consider other solutions.

, Older dogs often just can't hold their waste as long, regardless of how well they are trained, and you may need to make accommodations to help your dog avoid accidents. Let your dog out more often when you're home, and pay attention to cues that she needs to go. In addition, consider the following options:If you have a secure yard, think about installing a doggie door so your dog can let herself out.
Hire a dog walker, or make arrangements with a trusted neighbor to come over and give your dog mid-day relief breaks.
Provide piddle pads in a set location for your dog to use if she cannot wait until you get home.

, If you are having trouble identifying why your dog is still eliminating in the house, a consultation with a pet behavior specialist can be extremely helpful for diagnosing and treating the problem. Ask your vet or other dog-owners in your area for a recommendation.

, If you suspect that your dog is eliminating in the house due to anxiety or unpreventable stress, ask your vet if anxiety medication might be right for your dog. Medication, when used in conjunction with behavioral therapy and modifications to the dog's environment, will often help "

They can be strong willed and are often described as having the temperament of a big dog in a small dog’s body.Yorkshire terriers range widely in their intelligence. Some are quick learners while others are slow.


You will soon find out if you have a quick learner by how quickly your Yorkie picks up basic commands.
If your Yorkie is a slow learner, don’t fret. They are very trainable dogs, but you need to be patient and expect to repeat the same exercises on numerous occasions.;
, Because Yorkies are so small, you should always use a lightweight harness for the dog’s leash rather than attaching the leash to your dog’s collar. In order to keep identification tags on your dog, you should also use a lightweight collar, and you should be able to insert a finger or two between the collar and your dog’s neck to ensure that it’s not too tight.

, Dogs respond well to reward-based training. The principle behind this is that a good behavior—obeying a command, for instance—is immediately rewarded (usually with praise and a treat), which makes the dog associate the behavior with the reward. The dog will in turn want to repeat the behavior in order to continue receiving the reward.When using treats to reward behavior, be careful not to overfeed. Cut back a little on the amount you give during regular meals so that the extra calories from the treats do not make your dog overweight. You can also cut back on treats (while still offering lots of praise) as your dog masters a behavior or command. Reduce to providing a treat every fourth or fifth time your Yorkie obeys instead of each time. This won’t weaken the training as long as you still praise the obedience.

, A useful way to reward good behavior is clicker training. This involves using a small device that makes a clicking noise to mark the exact moment of the desired behavior. By training your dog to associate the click with praise and a treat, you can then mark moments of good behavior with the clicker and provide the reward. The click noise makes it even easier for your Yorkie to understand the exact moment of the good behavior.For more information on the specifics of clicker training, check out How to Clicker Train Your Dog.

, While it seems intuitive to humans to punish bad behavior, negative attention is an ineffective deterrent for dogs. Giving your dog attention in the form of a scolding is actually rewarding the dog with attention in its eyes. If you simply ignore bad behavior, your dog is more likely to bore of it and stop repeating the behavior., While ignoring bad behavior is the most effective method for most behaviors, this won’t stop your Yorkie from exhibiting behaviors that the dog finds rewarding in themselves—such as chewing on your favorite pair of shoes. In these situations, you should try to distract the dog without calling attention to the bad behavior.For example, you might ""accidentally"" kick your dog’s favorite chew toy and say “Oops"" to draw attention to it. When your dog gets up and goes to the toy, pick up both your dog and the toy and set them in a different room away from the inappropriate object.Whenever possible, you should also Yorkie-proof areas of your home to which your dog has access, which can take more planning than you’ll initially realize. For a dog that can’t reach very high, Yorkies still manage to get into trouble. Keep dangling cords, houseplants, clothes, and food out of reach, and don’t forget the effectiveness of baby gates for such a small dog., Like other dog breeds, Yorkies are den animals and take to comfortable crates as safe places.Proper crate training is especially helpful when house training your Yorkie since dogs will naturally try to hold their bladders in order not to go in their dens.Never force your Yorkie into the crate or use it as a timeout spot, though. Crate training only works when the crate is a trusted, enjoyable space for your dog.
For more information on the specific steps involved in crate training your Yorkie, read How to Crate Train Your Dog or Puppy.

, Set clear boundaries about what the dog is allowed to do and what is forbidden and be consistent above all. If you don’t allow your Yorkie to do something—jump up onto the sofa, for instance—then this must be the rule at all times. If you intermittently allow the dog up, it will only confuse your pup due to the mixed messages., You can let your Yorkie know that he or she is about to make a mistake by making a noise in a disapproving tone, such as ""Uh uh.” This is called a ""negative marker"" and gives your dog valuable information that he or she is making a wrong choice. A negative marker is never backed up with punishment. It is not a warning but a clue as to how to behave, so the dog can change and make the right decision.An example would be when teaching the “stay” command. If your dog stands from sit, a brief disapproving ""uh uh"" provides the information that standing is incorrect.

, Yorkies have a fairly short attention span. Train only a single command at any given time. The length of training sessions varies on the individual. As a guide, little and often is best. Try four- or five-minute sessions spread through the day.


Do not forget that every interaction with your dog is also an opportunity for training. For example, before feeding, get your dog to sit and reward the behavior with the meal.
Some commands are linked—such as “sit” and “stay”—but your dog should have a solid command of “sit” before you try linking “stay” to it.

, As with other training, consistency is important when house training your Yorkie. Initially, pick a specific spot where you want your dog to toilet to help him or her associate the spot with going to the bathroom., The first several instances of your dog toileting in the correct spot will be a matter of the right place at the right time. You can help your dog start to understand that it’s the correct behavior by offering plenty of praise and a treat for the happy coincidence.For a puppy, this is as often as every twenty minutes when the dog hasn’t gone recently, as well as first thing in the morning, last thing at night, and after every meal.
For an adult dog, this can be hourly, after sleep, and after meals.

, As with other training, punishment is not an effective deterrent for your Yorkie when it comes to house training. Punishment will only make your dog wary of you and try to find more secretive places in the house to go.


This includes rubbing your dog’s nose in the mess. This is not an effective deterrent. Your Yorkie won’t understand why you’re doing it.

, Your dog will smell the remnants of any indoor messes and be drawn back to those spots to go again. Clean up any messes using an enzymatic cleaner to get rid of any lingering smell that could draw the dog back. This will help make the house-training process easier on both of you.

, If you’re crate training your Yorkie, ensure that you properly use it to help with toilet training. A crate can help because your Yorkie will be more reluctant to soil his or her ""den"" and more likely to hold on and go in the yard., As your Yorkie starts to understand that going in the correct place means a reward, he or she will want to obey. However, it’s not exactly easy for your pup to communicate to you that it’s time to go except by going. You have to offer your dog help in this arena by watching for telltale pacing, waiting by the door you use to take the dog out, whining, etc.


If you’re running into difficulty with a stubborn pup, you can find more information on the entire house-training process at How to House Train a Puppy.

, Start training in a place with few distractions, such as a room at home or in your yard. As your dog starts to understand and respond to commands, be sure to vary the training spot. You don’t want your Yorkie to mistakenly believe that ""sit"" means “sit in front of the apple tree” or to accidentally tie other commands to a specific location.


Slowly introduce the commands in busier areas as your dog begins to understand them. The ultimate goal is to ensure that your Yorkie will still obey the commands even with bustling people and other dogs around. Have patience since the amount of time this takes depends entirely on your specific dog’s personality.
You’ll likely want to have your dog on leash as you slowly start to introduce more distractions since the chances of losing focus will be high at first.

, Until your dog starts to get the hang of the “here” command, you’ll have to help him or her out by using it when the dog is already moving toward you. Use your clicker to mark the action (if clicker training) then give the reward.After you’ve created a strong association between the two things, you can start to command ""here"" when your dog isn’t moving toward you.


Do not continuously repeat the command if your dog doesn’t obey since it will weaken the command. Instead, resume waiting until the dog is already coming toward you to issue it. Wait until later to again try issuing the command when your dog is standing still or moving away.
It can be a frustrating process. Remember to stay patient, not to punish, and always to reward your Yorkie when he or she does finally come to you.

, Place the dog in the corner of a room and hold the treat at nose height. Let the dog sniff but not eat the treat. Raise the treat in an arc so that your dog’s nose goes up and bottom goes down. As his or her bottom hits the ground, click the clicker (if clicker training) and provide plenty of praise and a treat. Repeat the exercise often and start adding the “sit” command before raising the treat above your dog’s head.Expect to repeat this process often before it fully registers with your Yorkie.
As he or she starts to react to the command to sit, you can stop rewarding each individual instance and make the reward a bit less predictable, which will prevent overfeeding while still keeping your pup working toward the reward. Rewarding every fourth or fifth sit is ideal.

, Have your dog sit and stay in that position. Gently pick up one of your dog’s front legs at the elbow and slide your hand down to around his or her wrist. Shake and then offer praise and treats. Remember to use the clicker if you’re clicker training. As your Yorkie begins to understand the trick, introduce a simple command like “shake” for the behavior. Repeat the action often until your dog understands the expected behavior, With your Yorkie in a prone position, take a treat and hold it next to the dog’s shoulder. As your pup turns his or her head toward the treat, continue bringing it back around the dog’s back toward the other shoulder. Your Yorkie will naturally follow the treat with his or her head, which will cause the pup to roll.As with other tricks, make sure you click if using clicker training, and then provide plenty of praise and the treat. As your dog begins to understand the trick, introduce a simple command as you do it, such as “roll.”


Initially, you may want to keep the hand not holding the treat on your Yorkie’s rump to keep the dog from standing up to follow the treat, or you can also teach your pup a “lay down” command before trying to teach the dog to roll over.

, You can use the same training process for additional commands after your Yorkie masters these basic, important ones. Find ways to make happy coincidences of the behavior while marking it with your clicker (if clicker training) and providing plenty of praise and a treat. After many repetitions, you dog will begin to understand, and you can apply your desired command to the behavior.


Remember to be patient above all else. Your Yorkie wants to learn and to please you, but it still takes time!

Pick a regular potty spot.,
Keep a consistent schedule.,
Supervise her behavior.,
Look for suggestive body language.,
Give her lots of praise.,
Deodorize accident spots.,
Avoid punishing her.,
Take your time.,
Watch for incontinence.,
Take time off.",How to House Train a Rescue Dog," When you are first teaching your dog to housetrain, you need to take her outside to the same spot every time your take her to potty. She will start associating this spot with going to the bathroom. Her scent will also help spur her to potty there each time., When you are training her, you need to keep a consistent time schedule of when she goes outside. You should take her out first thing in the morning as soon as she wakes up. Throughout the day, she should be taken to her spot once an hour and also 15 to 30 minutes after she eats. You should also take her out right before bed.


You also need to leave her outside for enough time when you take her out. This can range depending on your dog., When she is learning, your dog should not be allowed to roam the house by herself. She may have an accident in the house, which will scent mark that area as somewhere for her to go potty. This can create confusion for her and draw her back, so try to avoid it if possible.


Try to keep her restricted to two or three rooms of the house during this time., Watch her behavior while you are with her in the house. Her body language will let you know when she needs to go out. She may start intense sniffing, circling, become restless, sidling up to objects, and returning to any spot she may have messed in the house before.


If you see this behavior, you should take her out immediately.

, When you take her outside and she goes in her spot, give her lots of praise and affection once she is done. You can also give her a treat as well. This will make her associate this behavior with praise and she'll want to do it again.You can give her cue words as she goes to the bathroom, such as 'toilet' or 'business' if you want to train her to go based on commands. Keep saying the word to her as she does it and then she'll learn the word relates to the action.
As time goes on and she goes to the bathroom outside more consistently, make the treats less frequent. Give her praise and play with her a little instead.

, In order to help your dog not go to the bathroom on old spots where she had an accident, you need to deodorize these spots. The odor will draw her back there and make her want to go to the potty on that spot again. House cleaning products often have ammonia, which can make the smell worse. This means you need to find a cleaner specifically made for pet soils.


When she goes to the bathroom inside, clean up the mess first. Throw any feces away in a sealed bag and soak up as much urine as you can with disposable towels.
Clean the spot once with the cleanser, working it into the carpet or flooring. Rinse the area well and then add a mixture of water and baking soda. Rinse again and dry up any additional moisture., When your dog does mess in the house, do not punish her at all. Do not ever rub a dog's face in the mess. She will not understand what she is being punished for and will learn to be scared of you instead. This can make it hard for her to go in front of you in the future, which will make it really hard for her.


She may even start hiding where she goes to the bathroom from you, which will be bad for your house and her training., Every dog will learn at his own pace. You just have to be patient and work with her over time and make sure you giving her clear signals and consistent behavior modifications. It will not happen overnight but, if you keep working at it, she will learn.If your dog is taking a really long time to pick up any portion of being housetrained, make sure you are giving her a consistent message about what she should do. If you are, you may need to try a different tactic., If you she constantly goes in the house and wets herself while she is asleep, your dog may be incontinent instead of not being housetrained. If you notice this, take him to the vet and speak with the rescue where you adopted him from to see what can be done or if there is an underlying problem., When you are housetraining your dog, you may need to take a little time off work to stay with her throughout the day. This way, she will have someone there with her to let her out throughout the day.


If you can't be there, see if another family member or friend can come check on her throughout the day to let her out. If someone does this, make sure you show them what you have been doing so her training is consistent. You might also consider a pet sitter.
If these are not options, consider If you cannot take time off, then either crate training your dog or keeping her in one easy to clean room. This will make for easier cleanup."

Purchase a crate.,
Make the crate feel like home to your bulldog.,
Encourage your bulldog to explore the crate.,
Practice leaving your bulldog in the crate.,
Do not use the crate as punishment.,
Select an outdoor bathroom spot.,
Establish a regular bathroom schedule.,
Praise your bulldog when he eliminates outside.,
Clean up your bulldog’s accidents.,
Keep training sessions short.,
Teach only one command at a time.,
Train your bulldog indoors and give him water.",How to Train Bulldogs," Crate training will have many benefits for your bulldog, including protecting him from household hazards and reducing his separation anxiety.To begin crate training, you will need to select the right-sized crate for your bulldog. It should be either 24 x 30 inches (61 x 76 cm) or 24 x 36 inches (61 x 91 cm) for a French bulldog, and either 42 x 30 inches (107 x 76 cm) or 42 x 36 inches (107 x 91 cm) for an American bulldog.Your bulldog should be able to sit, stand, and lie down easily in the crate, but not have enough space to create a bathroom area.If you have a puppy, consider purchasing a crate with an adjustable divider. This will allow you to increase the crate space as your puppy grows into an adult.;
, The crate should be a place of safety and comfort for your bulldog. The more welcoming it feels to him, the more likely he’ll want to spend time inside of it. Place his favorite blanket and toys in the crate. You can also place a quilt or sheet over the crate to make it feel like a cozy den.In addition, place his food and water bowls in the crate.

, Since bulldogs are motivated by food, place some food in your bulldog’s bowl or on the crate floor to encourage him to enter the crate. A bowl would preferable, since he wouldn't be able to pull it out of the crate very easily.Whenever he enters the crate, give him lots of verbal praise—this will teach him that going inside his crate is a good thing.


Leave the door open during the early stages of crate training so he can explore the crate at his leisure.
Consider giving him a verbal command, such as ‘crate,’ to enter the crate.Immediately give him a treat and verbal praise when he enters the crate after your command.

, Once your bulldog is comfortable entering the crate on his own, work on closing its door behind him. Start with closing the door for only a few seconds and then letting him out. If he starts whining or crying, wait until he calms down before opening the door. When he can handle a few seconds, close the door, leave the room, and return after random lengths of time (e.g., 2 minutes, 5 minutes).Opening the door only when he is calm will teach him not to use whining and crying to get your attention while he is in the crate.
Remember that puppies cannot hold their bladders for very long, so you should not leave your puppy bulldog in the crate for long time periods.Until 12 months of age, puppies can hold their bladders for about 1 hour per month of age.When you are home, spend time with your bulldog while he is in the crate. Bulldogs are friendly and sociable dogs; interacting with your bulldog will keep him from getting lonely., Always remember that the crate is a place of safety and comfort, not punishment.No matter how frustrated you get with your bulldog, especially if he has misbehaved, never send him to his crate to punish him. Your bulldog should always have a positive association with the crate.

, Through house training, your bulldog will learn how to eliminate outside. If you have a backyard, choose an area of your yard where he will be protected from the elements (e.g., wind, rain) while eliminating.If you do not have a backyard, choose a spot on your usual walking route where he can safely eliminate.


Your bulldog should eliminate in this same spot each time. In your backyard, this spot will have his scent, so he will know to return to that area., House training will not be effective if your bulldog does not know when he’ll be going outside. This is particularly important for puppies. If you have a bulldog puppy, take him out after certain activities, including eating, drinking and playing. In addition, he should go out first thing in the morning, before he goes to bed, and when you take him out of the crate.Puppy bulldogs need to go out anywhere from 4 to 10 times a day. Adult and elderly bulldogs should go out 3 to 4 times a day.Take your adult or elderly bulldog out after eating as well.
If your work schedule does not allow you to take your puppy bulldog out frequently, consider hiring a pet sitter or asking a neighbor to take him out during the day.

, Your bulldog needs to know he’s done the right thing during house training. Give him plenty of verbal praise (‘Good dog!’ or ‘Good job!’) when he eliminates in the designated spot.The more positive reinforcement he gets from you, the more likely he’ll eliminate outside rather than in your home.

, During house training, your bulldog may have the occasional accident in the house, particularly if he’s a puppy. Clean up the accident with an enzymatic cleaner so he doesn’t go back to the same spot.Do not punish him (e.g., rubbing his nose in the urine or feces), especially if you didn’t catch him in the act—he will not be able to connect the punishment with what he did, and may end up being afraid to eliminate when you’re around.Do not use a cleaner with ammonia. Ammonia breaks down to urate, which is a component of urine.Keep your bulldog away from the area when you clean it up so he cannot see what you are doing. If he sees you, he might think eliminating inside is okay, since you’re willing to clean it up.If you catch him in the act, firmly say ‘No,’ take him outside quickly and praise him when he finishes eliminating outside., Bulldogs have short attention spans, so training sessions with your bulldog should not last more than 5 to 10 minutes.Make the training sessions positive and upbeat so the training won’t feel like a chore to him.

, Trying to teach multiple commands at one time may confuse your bulldog, and he may not learn any of them. Instead, focus on one command at a time and practice it until your bulldog masters it. It may take him a while to learn each command, so be patient with him. Your bulldog wants to please you, so take your time with him as he learns.Start with basic commands, such as sit, stay, and heel.

Bulldogs can be very possessive with food. Teach your bulldog the 'leave it’ and ‘drop it’ commands. These commands will teach him to let go of food so you don't have to reach into his mouth and possibly get bitten.Consider enrolling your bulldog in obedience training so he can learn basic commands. Formal obedience train can keep him physically and mentally busy., Bulldogs have shortened faces, making it hard for them to breathe. Training your bulldog inside your home, where he will be in a temperature-controlled room and not exposed to heat or humidity, will help him breathe more easily. Also, since panting can cause a lot of phlegm to build up in your bulldog’s airway, make sure he has plenty of water to drink during his training sessions."

Install a fence.A sturdy fence is the first step to keeping your dog safe in your backyard.,
Make a boundary around any water.,
Provide a dog house.,
Keep your dog from ruining your garden.To keep your dog out of the garden, spray plants with white vinegar or apple bitter, both of which are natural concentrates with unpleasant odors designed to keep dogs away from certain areas.,
Keep your dog from chewing on things it shouldn't.",How to Dog Proof a Yard1," With a good fence, your dog cannot escape the yard and other dogs or animals cannot get into the yard, where they could harm your dog.Choose a fence material that meets your budget. Wood, steel, chain-link, and plastic all make good fencing materials.
Make the fence at least six feet tall. The larger your dog, the taller the fence should be.
After the fence is installed, walk the perimeter to check for spaces where your dog might be able to slip underneath. Install chicken wire in these areas.
Repair any holes in the fence as they appear.;
, Dogs are attracted to water, both to drink from and swim in. Even if your dog is a good swimmer, there’s danger in leaving them alone with a pool since they might not be able to get out of the pool if the edges are slippery.Fence in your swimming pool or other water area with six-foot tall fencing.
Don’t ignore smaller reflecting pools: a small dog can easily fall into a shallow pool and drown.

, A dog house is essential to protect your dog from the elements. The dog house should be large enough for your dog to turn around in and it should be fully covered on top to protect your dog from rain, snow, and sunlight.Choose a material that is suitable for your environment. If you live in a warm environment, use clay tiles on the floor of the dog house to keep your dog cool. In the winter, place a blanket on the floor to help keep your dog warm.

, Alternately, you could plant marigolds between rows of plants and flowers you really want in your garden. Marigolds, like vinegar and apple bitter, contain a scent that dogs shy away from.You can obtain apple bitter at your local pet store and white vinegar from your local grocer.
Sprinkle powdered mustard and/or red pepper flakes around your plants.Dogs do not like these scents and will avoid areas where these odors abound.
The potency of the anti-dog odors declines over time. Any measure you adopt to protect your garden will need to be renewed occasionally, especially after it rains.
Do not use coyote urine or similar products in your garden. While it does effectively ward off deer and rabbits, coyote urine will attract dogs, and your dog will roll about in the garden and mark it as its own territory.

, If your dog gets into other areas of the yard you don't want it to, you can solve the problem using the same solutions you used to keep your dog out of your garden. That is, spray white vinegar or apple bitter on other things you want to keep your dog from chewing. Or, for instance, if you have furniture in your yard that you want to keep your dog from chewing, sprinkle powdered mustard or red pepper flakes in a cordon around the furniture to keep your dog away.Citrus is another scent that does not appeal to dogs. Spray concentrated lemon juice on any objects you do not want your dog chewing or scratching.

Break the trick down.,
Keep commands consistent.,
Say the command once.,
Use a treat to encourage the behavior you want.,
Fade out the treats.,
Keep repeating the practice.,
Limit your training periods to short intervals.,
Change up your tricks.,
End happy.",How to Train Border Collies1," For instance, the command ""stay"" can be broken into a number of steps. The first step is to teach your dog to sit and not get up until you tell her to. Then, you can move on to staying for a short time. Next, move on to staying for a longer period.One trick you might want to teach your border collie is ""down,"" since border collies like to herd anything they animal or person they can find. By teaching them this trick, you'll be able to control their behavior better when they start to herd, especially if you pair it with other commands such as ""drop."";
, That is, always use the same word for the same behavior. Switching between ""sit"" and ""sit down"" can confuse your dog. Pick one, and stick to it.Border collies are also smart enough to learn whistle commands.

, Border collies will pick up on the command quickly, so just say it once and teach the behavior. If you say it multiple times, she may expect you to say it multiple times every time you give the command., For instance, if you want to teach a dog to sit, hold the treat an inch in front of her nose. Slowly move the treat above her head. This movement encourages her to sit. Don't forget to use the command in conjunction with the action. Once the dog sits, praise her and give her the retreat., Once the dog starts learning the trick, you can still guide the dog but take away the treat. Reward him with praise and petting.Instead of fading out the treats completely, you can use intermittent reinforcement. That is, only reward the dog with a treat at random times. That way, she will still do what you want with the hope of getting a treat, but she won't expect one every time. Border collies are smart enough to understand this process., Over time, keep repeating the command so that your dog will slowly learn what you want her to do., Most dogs get bored easily, and it can be especially true with border collies, given their high intelligence. Don't let a training session go beyond 15 minutes., That is, don't try to teach the same trick for the whole 15 minutes. You can do as few as 5 repetitions trying to teach one trick or up to 15. Switch to another task after that., That is, end with a trick your dog knows how to do. That way, you can praise her up and down, and she'll be willing to try learning tricks with you again sometime."

Rid your yard of poisonous plants and weeds.Many common backyard plants are toxic to dogs.,
Seal your garbage cans.,
Keep your dog away from treated grass.,
Use natural pest controls.",How to Dog Proof a Yard2," For example, tulips, daffodils, azaleas, and amaryllis can all make your dog sick or even cause them to die.Begin by talking to a vet about which plants are toxic to your dog. Different dog breeds are sensitive to different plants.
Make an inventory of the plants in your backyard so you know how many toxic plants you have and where they are located.
Remove the toxic plants or fence them in with chicken wire.

, Garbage cans are a source of many toxins. Common household items such as cleaning supplies and batteries can leave toxic sludge in the bottom of your garbage cans. If you dog gets into the cans, they might get sick.Ideally, you should keep your garbage cans outside of the fenced area where your dog hangs out.
If you must keep your garbage cans in the yard, make sure they have sealing lids and always seal the lids after you throw out the trash.

, If you spray your yard with insecticides or weed killer, your dog may ingest these chemicals if they play in the grass. After treating the grass, keep your dog out of the yard for at least twenty-four hours.You can also use non-toxic lawn products. Ask a sales associate at a lawn and garden stores about pet-safe products.
Read fertilizer and biocide labels carefully to ensure they are nontoxic. If they are not nontoxic read the label to determine how long you must wait before allowing your dog back into the yard after you’ve used them., If you have rodent traps in your yard or along your porch, your dog might get into them. If your dog consumes mouse poison, for instance, it could suffer kidney failure, brain swelling, and other serious ailments. To avoid this unhappy outcome, try planting or sprinkling mint around your yard instead of using rodent poisons."

Understand your border collie's instincts.,
Provide food in the disc.,
Tease him with the disc.,
Tell him to drop it.,
Start with rolling.,
Throw the disc.,
Call him back to you.,
Train in various styles.",How to Train Border Collies2," Border collies are herding dogs, but they are also chasing dogs. Therefore, games and sports like catching discs are perfect for border collies.In fact, disc catching and throwing is not just a backyard sport, as you can compete with your dogs in local and national competitions., If your border collie associates the disc with food, he'll think it's okay to hold it in its mouth. Try providing dinner in the disc for several nights in a row., Shake the disc back and forth in play. Your border collie will likely latch on to it and want to play., First let him play with the disc, saying ""good boy!"" Then tell him to ""drop it."" Try to pull it back from him. Don't let him play tug-of-war. If he doesn't want to give it up, just stop talking and praising. In fact, ignore him completely. Because he wants your attention, he'll likely drop it. Praise when he does. Continue working on the ""drop it"" cue., Your pup will naturally chase after the disc if you roll it away from you. Ask him to come back, and tell him to ""drop it."" He'll soon catch on that this game is fun, and he'll play along., When throwing, toss it away from your border collie. He will chase it down or even catch it in the air. You don't want to toss it directly at your border collie, as you could hit him and it takes some of the fun out of chasing it down.Let him play with it if he catches it, but go grab it yourself if he doesn't, as your teaching him to catch it and playing with the disc is a reward., Once your border collie catches the disc, call him back to you, and tell him to drop it for you., For instance, one event in disc events for dogs is throwing and catching at various distances. You'll need to practice your throws, and you'll need to teach your dog to catch at these various distances. Generally, in these events, you gradually increase your distance in a timed period."

Start young.,
Keep your puppy in a confined space.,
Take your puppy out often.,
Reward the behavior you want.In this case, directly after the puppy finishes going to the bathroom (while you are still outside), praise the puppy and offer her a treat.,
Take the puppy outside if she starts going to the bathroom.,
Keep on a schedule.,
Be consistent.,
Don't try negative reinforcement.,
Be patient.,
Allow your puppy more range.",How to Train Border Collies3," As soon as you have your border collie in your house, you can start training it. Your puppy is absorbing information whether you are actively trying to train him or not, so you might as well start teaching good habits young., You can use a crate or a leash. You can also try a small room. That way, you can keep an eye on the puppy, and if he starts to go the bathroom, you can take him outside.Also, dogs don't like going to the bathroom in the same place they sleep, so your puppy is less likely to go in a relatively small space.When picking out a crate, check to see if it is large enough. Your dog should be able to stand up in it and turn around.Stop using the crate for a time if the dog decides to go the bathroom in it, as that defeats the purpose. He may not be ready for house training, or he may have other issues you need to solve, such as taking him out more often., Your 2-month-old puppy can hold it for about 2 hours, while a 3-month-old can hold it for about 3 hours, and so on. However, when you are trying to house train your puppy, make sure to take it out at least every 1 to 2 hours to go to the bathroom.Some experts recommend waiting until 3 months to start training your puppy, when he has more control over his bladder.The best way is use a leash and lead your puppy to the same spot in the yard every time. One of the benefits of using the same spot is your puppy will smell her scent there and want to go in the same place.Also, begin using a verbal cue, such as ""potty time"" each time, so your dog learns to associate those words with going to the bathroom.If your dog doesn't go to the bathroom when you take him outside, put him back in the confined space, and try again in 30 minutes.,, Start by making a noise to startle the pup a bit and get her to stop going. Then, take out to her spot in the yard. If she keeps going there, follow with a reward., Of course, you need to take your puppy out on schedule. However, you also need to feed him on schedule, as that will lead to more consistent bathroom times. You'll need to feed your dog about 4 times a day, so spread the feeding times out evenly over the day., If you're not consistent with providing and taking away rewards, your dog will be confused about what you want., For instance, pushing the dog's face in an accident or getting angry will only make the situation worse. Your dog may learn to be afraid of you, rather than what you want--to go to the bathroom outside. Give as little attention as possible to the problem when he has an accident because even negative attention is attention to a dog., It can take up to half a year to fully house train your dog. You may get frustrated at all the accidents, but you will be rewarded in the end with a dog who knows when to go to the bathroom., If your dog seems to have potty training down, you can give him more freedom to roam around the house. However, you should still try to keep him out of areas that you really don't want him to use the bathroom in."

Watch for the stance.,
Give your border collie plenty of exercise.,
Learn the difference between your border collie's growls.,
Let your dog follow her instincts.",How to Train Border Collies4," If your border collie lowers her head and front legs, as well as her tail, she is getting into her herding stance. This stance is part of her natural instinct for herding. If you see her drop into this stance, it's because she wants to herd whatever it is she's concentrating on, from cats to cars., Border collies need a great deal of stimulation, so be sure to give your dog plenty of exercise to keep her happy., A border collie usually has two types of growls, one serious and one play. You need to learn the difference so you don't upset your dog when she's being serious. Listen for play growls when she's playing tug-of-war, and learn to differentiate the sound from her more serious growl.Learning these two growls will also help if you choose to train your border collie on sheep, as you'll be able to tell when she is growling at the sheep in earnest.

, Your border collie was bred to help out shepherds by herding animals. That means that she wants a job to do. If you can give her a space to herd, that's great. If you don't have room for other animals, you may consider recreational herding, which is a form of dog sport.Other ""jobs"" you can give your border collie involve providing her with a digging hole (out of the way) or allowing her to ""herd"" cats under your direction. Use her bad behaviors, such as digging holes in the yard or chasing cats, and turn them into something controlled."

Teach your beagle not to bark at other dogs.,
Set up a housetraining routine.,
Be consistent.,
Feed your dog on a regular basis.,
Watch your dog for signs.,
Be prepared to deal with accidents.",How to Train Beagles," By nature, beagles are highly energetic and have a good sense of smell. They have descended from working dogs who used to follow scents during a hunt. This also means they tend to think for themselves, rather than rely on their owner to give directions. If your pet beagle won't be doing any hunting, training your dog is important.Beagles also like to use their voices and often bark when they get excited. Good training and plenty of exercise are key to prevent this becoming a problem.
Commit to regular training sessions (at least twice a day), for as long as it takes to successfully train your beagle. Don't be discouraged, and certainly don't give up.;
, A beagle likes to think of himself as the leader, which is a recipe for disaster for the inexperienced dog trainer. You'll need to take a firm lead so that the dog believes he must follow your commands. Always use positive enforcement methods of training, instead of punishment.Your beagle's mind may also be elsewhere, so expect training a beagle to take longer than for other more easily influenced dogs like Labradors or Border collies.

, Don't simply enforce commands only during training sessions. Your beagle will be more successful if you work with him on commands throughout the day.


For example, you might insist that he sits before you put his food bowl down or sits at the curb before crossing a road. If the dog does not obey, do not do the activity. So, if he doesn't sit for the food, put it away. Get him to sit, then bring the food bowl out.
If he refuses to sit at the curb, retrace your steps, then approach the curb and ask again.If you really need to cross the road and he still refuses, retrace your steps. Then, move forward and cross the road, but don't request your dog to sit., Food is a powerful motivator for beagles and some dogs are also highly motivated by attention and praise. Plan to use food rewards as part of your reward based-training, so that you give a treat immediately when the dog responds. As your dog starts responding on a regular basis, then give a reward every fourth or fifth success.


Try giving your beagle high-quality commercial dog treats that contain few fillers. Or, you can give cooked lean meats or baked potato, cut into small bites., Since beagles are energetic dogs, it may be harder to teach them if they'd rather be running off than listening to your instruction. Try to take your beagle out for 1 hour twice a day, for some good running exercise. This will burn up some of his energy and make him more receptive to you as a teacher.


You might play fetch or run with your dog on a leash.
Remember that this breed is capable of running all day, so a 20-minute walk around the block twice a day won't exhaust him., Attract your beagle by holding a treat in your hand. Show the treat, but don't let him have it. Instead, hold it just in front of his nose, holding it in between your finger and thumb. Once you have his attention, raise the treat so that the dog is forced to raise his nose. Arc the treat backwards so that when he follows it, his natural reaction is to sit. As he starts to move into sitting position, firmly say ""sit"" and give him the treat.Practice the ""sit"" command at every opportunity and in different locations, like at home in the yard, or on the street. This prevents tunnel vision where the beagle thinks he only has to respond if the command is given on his home turf.Eventually, your dog will respond to ""Sit"" alone, without tracing the arc of the treat. Once he is doing this regularly, skip giving a treat. This builds uncertainty into the dog's mind so he doesn't take the treat for granted but works harder for it., Your dog should be able to follow the sit command before you teach the stay command. Get your beagle in the sitting position. Hold up a hand like you're stopping someone and say ""stay"" in a firm voice.Your dog might only do this for a second or two, but you should give him lots of praise and keep practicing.
Eventually, you can practice moving away from your dog while he stays.

, There are several simple things you can try to keep your beagle from jumping up. If he successfully follows your requests, give him lots of praise.One method: you can ignore the jumping and walk away. Call him after a few minutes and give him lots of praise.
Another method: you can use the stay command, followed by the sit command.
If you suspect your beagle is jumping up out of boredom, consider schooling him. The behavior may stop while he's busy learning new things.

, If the dog happens to approach you, say ""come."" If not, attract him closer with a treat. As he gets to you, repeat ""come"" and then make a big fuss of him or give a treat. Give your dog the time to complete the command.If your dog is taking a frustratingly long time to come, don't scold the beagle or snap the lead on and march your dog away. Your dog will associate the recall command with punishment.
Once your dog has come to your side, instead of setting off straight home, give him his favorite toy and indulge him in a game on leash for a minute or two. That way he doesn't link the recall to punishment or an end to entertainment., If your dog bites during playtime, avoid playing aggressively or roughly with him. If he starts biting during a game, stop playing. Your beagle will soon figure out that biting ends the fun.Give your dog space and let him get comfortable around you before approaching him.


If your beagle bites you or another person, it may be because he is afraid or doesn't trust you.
Your dog may begin biting, but that doesn't mean he's a mean or aggressive dog. Your beagle may just be curious, playing, or defending himself. It's a good idea to teach your dog not to bite, regardless of what's causing him to do it., Beagles often bark when they get excited or want to play. Unfortunately, this can be misunderstood by strangers as being aggressive or by other dogs as being overwhelming. When you're at home, learn to read your dog's facial expression when he is about to bark. He may look intensely focused, scrunch up his face, or begin to scowl. Pay attention to the unique face your dog makes before barking.


When you see that expression, distract him. You can use the favorite chew toy to get his attention. With the barking interrupted, get your dog to sit and reward the good behavior.
Sometimes, one recurring thing can cause your dog to bark: the doorbell, garbage trucks in the morning, the vacuum. Learn what causes your beagle to bark and then try to find a solution, either eliminating that thing or teaching your dog not to bark.

, Your beagle will most likely encounter other dogs when you take him for walks. To begin, keep your dog on a leash. When he sees a dog and starts to bark, say ""quiet,"" then turn and walk in the opposite direction.Once the beagle has settled down, turn back towards the other dog. Keep repeating this, and eventually your beagle will learn that barking is counterproductive.


If you're out walking your beagle and notice other dogs, don't tense up and worry about whether your dog will bark. Chances are, your beagle can read your tension, which will also put him on alert, making it more likely that he'll bark., Start as soon as you bring the dog home by setting him onto the toilet place. If he squats, say a cue word like, ""business"" or ""toilet time."" When he's finished, give him lots of praise or a food treat. Start by keeping the beagle in one room, so that he's not overwhelmed or distracted by a whole house of scents.
Reward your dog immediately after he eliminates, so he associates the reward with the action.

, Try to take your dog outside to eliminate every 20 to 30 minutes, if possible. Choose a place outside to take your dog to relieve himself. Always return to this spot when you take him out to eliminate. You should also put him out first thing in the morning, last thing at night, and after eating. When he appears to squat, give him lots of praise.


Since you're already outside, try rewarding your beagle with playtime in the park or a long walk., The important thing is to set out food at designated meal times, instead of letting your dog graze all day. Plan several meal times throughout the day. With regular meals should come regular needs to eliminate.Take your beagle outside to eliminate 30 to 40 minutes after each meal. Plan your trips outside around meals and stick to the routine.Young beagles, will need to go outside more frequently. As a general rule, a puppy can wait 1 hour for each month of age it is, up to 8 hours. For example, a 3 month old puppy can wait 3 hours.The amount of food you give your beagle will depend on whether you're feeding dry manufactured food, meat, canned manufactured food, or making it yourself. Talk to your vet about a healthy beagle diet.

, Your beagle will probably show signs that he's ready to eliminate. Pay attention to these and give him the opportunity to go outside before an accident can happen.


Look for barking or scratching at the door through which you take your puppy out, squatting, restlessness, and sniffing around or circling.It's better to take your beagle out even if you're not completely sure he needs to go.

, If your beagle has an accident in the house, never scold or get angry with the dog. Once he has moved away, thoroughly clean the area with an enzymatic cleaner so there is no scent left to draw him back.


Avoid general household cleaners which often contain bleach or ammonia. Ammonia is one of the components of urine. If you clean with it, you may actually make the scent signal or urine stronger which could make the beagle return to the wrong place to urinate.
Do not leave cleaning products around the house that your dog can get into. Most of them are hazardous to health, so store them correctly.

Give your pit bull lots of exercise.,
Use a crate.,
Give your dog a collar and tags.,
House-train your pit bull.,
Learn to read your dog's body language.",How to Train a Pit Bull1," If your pit bull is feeling cooped up or has too much energy, he or she might get aggressive. Take your pit bull on lots of walks if you don't have a big backyard to run around in. You should be prepared to spend at least two hours day with your pit bull to give him the exercise and attention he needs. Or, if you need to, you should get out yourself and go to a dog park along with your furry friend.


Walk your pit bull as often as necessary and take the time to clean up the dog's mess. A well-exercised dog is a happy dog.;
, Pit bulls, like other dogs, like having their own small area that belongs to them. The crate should never be used as a punishment, but rather as a place for pit bulls to sleep or to go to if they are feeling overwhelmed.

, Put a collar and tags on your new pit bull so that you can find him when he gets lost. You should also get a microchip for your dog so he can easily be found if all else fails. Many pit bulls that are lost suffer because it is difficult to place them into homes with new families. Take the short time to properly care for your pet and you'll make a big difference in his well-being.

, If your pit bull is a puppy, he will have to urinate often. He'll need to use the toilet during several occasions: after he eats, after a long car ride, when he wakes up from a deep sleep, and after exercise. He'll need to go every few hours throughout the day, though by six months, he should be able to go a night without using the restroom. Here's how you can house-train your pit bull:


Before you get your puppy, pick a toilet area outside your home that will be his go-to spot.
As soon as he gets home, take him to this area until he uses the bathroom.
Praise him for doing his business.
Look for signs that he needs to use the restroom and lead him to the area when he shows them. He may be scratching or sniffing the floor, walking in small circles, or generally looking agitated.

, Just like people, pit bulls are all different creatures with different fears and needs, and they have different body language that can show when they are upset or agitated. As you get to know your pit bull, look out for signs that show that he's upset. If he starts growling, barking, pacing in circles, or generally looks angry, then it's time to see what you can do to change the situation. Get to know your own little creature and look out for signs that he's too excited, upset, or even tired.


Some signs that your dog is uncomfortable around another dog or creature include a stiff posture, curled lip, growling, air snapping, tucking his tail between his legs, or even trying to hide behind you.
If your dog freezes, he also feels uncomfortable and his guard is up.
Find what you need to do to calm your dog down when he exhibits these behaviors, whether it's to move him away, give him a treat, praise him, take him for a walk, or to find a combination of these behaviors.

Learn about reward-based training.,
Find a training treat that your dog responds to.,
Keep a small amount of this treat in a treat pouch which you wear on your person.,
Cut back on the treats as your dog learns your commands.,
Socialize your dog.,
Start toy poodle training, including socialization, when your dog is still young.",How to Train a Toy Poodle1," This is a training method whereby good behavior is rewarded and so the dog wishes to repeat it to get a treat. Bad behavior, on the other hand, is either ignored or acknowledged with a brief verbal rebuke or other (non-violent) means of showing your displeasure. The idea behind this is to provide your dog with information that it chose the wrong action.;
, This might be food, a special toy, or just praising it. Even fussy eaters have something they love to eat that is a special treat for them. The trick is to find this treat. Try morsels of different foods, such as cheese, hotdog sausage, steak, chicken, or a commercial training treat, until you find one the dog really loves. You are going to use this treat as your pup's reward., This way you will be ready to reward the dog's good behavior throughout the day. Be careful not to overfeed the dog however. When using treats, cut back on your pup's daily food ration at mealtimes so as to compensate for the extra calories represented by the treats.

, Another factor to be aware of is that giving treats every time the dog does good can make it lazy, as the dog assumes it will get a treat. Once it learns to work for treats, make the reward intermittent, such as every fourth or fifth rewardable action, so that the dog stays on his or her best behavior to earn that reward.

, Training your dog to be a good canine citizen means helping it to be confident in different places, and with different people and other animals. This will help make your pet well-adjusted and able to adapt to various situations without displaying anxiety.

, Puppies have a socialization period where they learn more rapidly, so take advantage of this by taking your puppy to visit other people and carry the puppy alongside roads so she can get used to the sound of traffic and the such like. This window of opportunity closes at 18 weeks, after which the dog continues to learn but more slowly.Though adult toy poodles are trainable, it is much easier to teach younger dogs before bad behavior issues arise.

Mow your lawn.,
Clean up debris.,
Bury chicken wire.",How to Dog Proof a Yard3," Ticks, fleas, and other unpleasant critters hide out in tall grass. These critters spread disease and generally make your dog’s life less pleasant. The best way to reduce these critter populations is to keep your grass short.Aim for a grass length of 1.5 inches (3.8 cm). Check your lawnmower manual for instructions on how to change the cut length.Mow your lawn every five to seven days during the summer. The grass will grow approximately half an inch during this time. As you move into the fall and winter, you’ll notice your grass growing more slowly and dying off. When this occurs, reduce the frequency with which you mow.

, Most dogs will put just about anything in their mouths. If you leave stones, sticks, and other debris lying around the yard, your dog might eat it and injure itself.Before you let your dog outside for the first time, clean up obvious debris like large rocks and stones.
Once a week, check your yard for new debris. If there’s a storm, remove new debris right away.
Also remove damaged dog toys. A broken, jagged dog toy can do a lot of damage to your dog’s mouth and stomach if swallowed.

, Some dogs love to dig and if you leave them outside unattended they will inevitably make holes. You can foil your dog’s digging instincts by burying chicken wire a few inches below ground. When your dog reaches the wire it will stop digging.Start by digging up your yard so that it is loose dirt.
Next, lay a single layer of chicken wire over the entire yard.
Cover the chicken wire with several inches of dirt.
Replant any grass.
Because this process is fairly elaborate, you should only do it if your dog repeatedly digs holes.

Use positive reinforcement.,
Establish dominance.,
Leash train your dog.,
Stop biting before it starts.",How to Train a Pit Bull2," When you train your pit bull, focus on teaching him rather than the result. It will take him some time to catch on to your training. Give your dog a simple command when he's ready, and if he follows your orders, then reward him with praise or his favorite treat. Rewarding him with positive reinforcement instead of punishing him when something goes wrong is the way to earn his trust on to tame his aggression.When you use positive reinforcement, be consistent. Just as you would discipline a child, if your dog does something right, you should reward him every time (even if it's just by petting him and giving him kind words), or he will get confused by your mixed signals.
Always be firm. Don't give in, even if your dog looks particularly cute. This will only cause him to be more confused -- and more likely to act up in the future.

, Your dog should realize that you are the leader and that the dog must obey you. Pit bulls need a leader or they will try to become the dominant, alpha dog. Here are some ways to establish dominance over your dog while keeping his loyalty and respect. To show the dog that you are the leader of the pack your should be able to both give him permission to do the things he wants to do, and deny him permission to do the things he shouldn't.Give your dog praise so he knows that you own him. Give him this praise quickly but don't drag out the praise.
If your pit bull does something wrong, quickly correct him without dragging it out. Dogs have a memory attention span of 5 seconds; they live in the now moment.
Give and deny your pit bull permission to do things like eat, jump on the bed, or go outside. You do this to demonstrate your dominance.
When entering the house, your dog should follow you, allowing you to go first.
Your pit bull should obey you on your first command if you have established dominance.

, Train your pit bull to obey you even when the leash is loose rather than pulled tight. This allows your dog to have the freedom to explore and go to the bathroom, but the dog is still within your reach. Using the leash with your dog, especially when you're outdoors, will keep him from getting out of control. Here are some other things to keep in mind as you leash train your dog:


To train, the dog must learn that the leash should be slack at all times. If he puts tension in the leash, turn around and pull him the opposite direction. This will teach him to follow you and to not try to lead the way.
If your dog is keeping the leash slack, praise him or give him a treat so he knows he's doing what he is supposed to.

, If you want your pit bull to know that it's wrong to bite people, then you have to start when he's small. Sure, his nips may be cute when he's just a tiny pup, but his bites will have serious consequences when he's all grown up. Whenever he bites you, move your hand and cry out like you're in pain; this will trigger an alarm bell in your dog's head and will let him know that something is wrong.


Another way to prevent your pit bull from biting is to have lots of chew toys for him. This will channel his aggression in a playful and productive way. If he has no toys to bite, he's more likely to aim for your body.

"

Give commands using one-word phrases such as sit, stay, down and quiet.,
Aim for two 10 - 20 minute training sessions a day, plus incorporate training into normal activities.,
Teach your dog to sit.,
Teach other basic commands.,
Start by training your dog in a quiet place with few distractions such as the back yard.,
Consider enrolling at a training class.",How to Train a Toy Poodle2," Using long phrases during training can confuse your dog companion and cause delays in the training process. Keep all commands or cue words consistent, which means making sure all family members use the same commands.

, For example, at meal times get the poodle to ""Sit"" before putting her food down. If the dog is tired or her concentration is poor, then end the session and try again next time - you are more likely to teach her bad habits if you persist when she's not in the mood., Position the dog in front of you, so you are looking at each other. Put a treat in your hand and then put your hand in front of the dog, slightly above its head. Most dogs will naturally sit to get a better view of the treat being held above their head.


Once the dog sits, immediately praise it and give it the treat.

, Important commands to teach are stay and recall (getting the dog to come back on demand). When the dog obeys these commands this gives you a great deal of control over her behavior. For example, if she rushes to greet guests, by commanding her to ""Sit"" you can stop her jumping up at an anxious child.

, As she learns, make sure to expand the places you take her to for training, so she learns to obey under all circumstances, rather than just in the yard.

, It is a great way to get your dog used to obeying when there are other dogs around. In addition, the dog trainer can help you use the correct techniques and spot if you are inadvertently not acting correctly.

Focus on reducing inappropriate toileting.The principles of potty training are to reward a dog when it toilets in the right place, and to reduce the chances of it toileting in the wrong place.,
Keep your toy poodle in a crate when you can't keep an eye on it.,
Designate a toileting area and show the poodle where it is.Go with it to visit the toilet spot so that you are there to reward the pup when it squats.,
Take the dog out on a regular basis.",How to Train a Toy Poodle3," You do this by watching the dog like a hawk indoors, and when it starts sniffing as if to toilet take it outside to the toilet spot.


Never let the dog have unsupervised access to rooms until it is fully trained. It helps to keep a long line leash on the dog in the house, with the end looped over your wrist. That way you are aware of its movements and can keep a watch.

, You will need to train the dog to use a crate. The principle behind a crate is to act as a den, or a safe place where the dog enjoys spending time. It is large enough for it to stand up or lie down with its legs stretched out, but no more. This then reduces the chances of the dog soiling its den and teaches it bladder control.


Teach the toy poodle to go into the crate willingly by feeding it in there. Scatter treats or toys in the crate so that the dog associates it as a place where nice things happen. Over time your dog will go in willingly, and you can shut the door.
Avoid using the crate as a form of punishment.
Place the crate in an area where your toy poodle can see what is going on in the household so it can get accustomed to the daily routine and not feel lonely. Allow your toy poodle to come out of the crate for longer periods of time each day.

, Only by rewarding it will it start to build an association with the toilet spot and what the dog is there to do.

, For an adult dog, try to put it on the toilet spot hourly, and especially first thing in the morning and last thing at night. For a puppy, pop it out every 20 - 30 minutes.


Also be aware that food in the stomach stimulates the need to toilet so offering the toilet spot 15 - 20 minutes after eating will increase the success rate.

Invest in sprinklers.",How to Discourage Dogs from Pooping in Your Garden1," Perhaps the most obvious solution, if not the most cost effective, is simply fencing in your garden to keep dogs out.


Make sure your fence is in line with local property laws. Ask neighbors or go to city hall and check in with officials.
Fences can be an expensive option, but might be worth it if the dogs are not easily deterred. For small dogs, a 16-inch fence border will do. It costs roughly $29 for six feet. However, if you have larger and high energy dogs getting into the garden you might consider caging your garden in a chicken wire fence with a top enclosure.Installation can be tricky, particularly if you've never put up a fence solo before. You could consider hiring help, but that can get costly. How-to articles and videos are available online and you can always seek out the help of neighbors, friends, and family members. If the problem dog belongs to a neighbor, you could politely ask them to chip in some for the cost and help get the fence up.
Keep the gate closed at all time and routinely check for holes and other wear and tear.;
, Aesthetically, many people dislike fencing in their gardens. A plant barrier, meaning planting certain shrubs and flowers around the main garden, may be a more attractive option.


There are a variety of dog-proof plants. That is, plants that are sturdy and tall enough to withstand a dog's attempt to infiltrate the garden. These include peony, verbena, cone flower, black eyed Susans, Russian sage, and Mexican primrose. If you want other options, ask at your local greenhouse.Shrubs are another option for a plant barrier and may provide a more solidified boundary. Laurel, evergreen, huckleberry, and escallonia are good shrub options.While thorny or prickly bushes, such as holly and barberry, might seem like a good idea for deterring dogs be wary. These can cause harm to dogs when they attempt to get into the garden. You do not want to accidentally a neighbor's pet., You can also create a mote-like barrier encompassing the garden using gravel or mulch, textures dogs generally avoid treading on. This will deter the dog from entering your garden to defecate.


There are a variety of mulches available at hardware stores and greenhouses. Select a mulch that will be uncomfortable for a dog to walk over without harming the dog. One made from pine cones or pine needles is a great option.Decorative gravel, preferably with sharp edges, can also be purchased at hardware stores and greenhouses. Dogs will avoid walking on gravel because of the discomfort it causes to their pads. However, the one downside to gravel is that many people find it ugly. If you're unsure of using gravel due to aesthetic preferences, you can try to build a rock garden instead. However, the intended effect might not be as great as dogs can more easily navigated loosely collected rocks and stones., A sprinkler system can be a great way to scare dogs off your property. They will learn to avoid an area where they occasionally get wet.


A motion activated sprinkler is probably your best option. You can find one at a department store or on Amazon. This will be set off when motion is detected, so it will automatically fire cold water when a dog enters your garden.
Dogs will learn to associate your yard with an unexpected dousing of water. Eventually, they will learn to stay away.

Enjoy your Labrador.",How to Train a Naughty Labrador," The concept of 'naughtiness' is a human characterization that has been incorrectly applied to an animal. Your Labrador is not innately ""naughty"" or ""bad."" Rather, your dog does what Labradors do in a Labrador fashion until you teach him new behaviors. Keep in mind that he wasn't born automatically knowing the rules of living in a human world., Labradors are generally intelligent, happy, and energetic dogs. They need substantial attention and an outlet for their energy.


Labradors originated from and were developed in Newfoundland. They were frequently used by fishermen to help retrieve fishing nets and loose fish. To this day, they remain good ""workers"" and swimmers.
The versatility of the Labrador has seen the breed utilized in many ""jobs,"" including search and rescue, police work, drug detection, and service work for the blind, among others., Giving them what they need will help ensure that they don't engage in ""bad behaviors"" as a way to cope with the insufficiency of their treatment.


For example, Labradors need to play and be thoroughly walked.If you don't do this, they often become bored and destructive. Keep them active by playing fetch and going on substantial walks at least twice a day. Increased physical activity helps a dog stay healthy and also tires them out. A tired out Labrador will, in turn, be less inclined to help himself to the food in your cupboards and dig up your garden. Swimming is also excellent exercise for a dog and playing fetch in the water is a great combination that expends a lot of dog energy.

, Don't lecture your Labrador. Your commands need to be simple and consistent. ""No"", ""Drop"", ""Wait"" are strong, simple, and direct. ""Stop doing that, oh for goodness sake"" or ""Oi, stop eating my shoe"" will not work as they are too complicated. Remember that dogs don't process language like humans do.

, In general, shouting at any dog is ineffective. This is especially true for Labradors who are an excitable breed by nature. Use a firm voice when instructing your dog; don't yell or lose control. Dogs are very intuitive and will be able to sense your frustration and may react in kind.


Firm and assertive commands will communicate to the Labrador what you want him to do.

, Admonishing a Labrador too long after the incident is ineffective. If you need to admonish or correct your dog, it needs to be done during or within a few seconds of the act. Dogs will have forgotten the event within seconds of its occurrence, so it's key to address the behavior immediately in order to facilitate the retraining process.

, If you live in a household of more than one, your family also needs training. Explain to your family as well as visitors to your home about what your dog is and is not allowed to do. For example, if you do not allow anyone to feed your Labrador at the dinner table, then you need to let others know about that rule. If other family members or visitors don't know about this rule, they may feed your dog, which is confusing for him and will disrupt the training you have done.

, Beating or hitting Labradors when they behave in an undesirable manner will not help them become better trained dogs. Rather, they will become fearful of you, which will ultimately defeat the training process., It is easy to apply human morality and motivation to your Labrador. But the fact of the matter is that your Labrador is not human and 'just is' and 'just does'. For example, eating the sleeve of your best work shirt is not a conscious act on behalf of your dog to upset you. Oftentimes, the shirt was just there and it was chewable.Rewarding good behavior is more effective than punishing bad behavior. Instead of becoming exasperated with and angry at your Labrador for chewing your shirt, encourage him to chew his play toy and reward him with praise for doing so.

, Click training enables the immediate delivery of positive reinforcement. Labradors are highly trainable because they are so food motivated, which makes clicker training ideal for them.Clicker training uses a sound—a click—to tell the dog when he has done something right. The clicker itself is a tiny plastic box held in the palm of your hand, with a metal tongue that you push quickly to make the sound. The method works by teaching the dog that every time he hears the clicking sound, he gets a treat. Eventually the dog will come to learn that clicks are always followed by treats, which is a very powerful incentive for Labradors. One your dog makes this connection, you can use the click to mark the instant the Labrador performs the right behavior, such as sitting down. Over time, he will learn that sitting down when told gets him rewards.Learn how to clicker train your dog.

, Most dogs are perpetually hungry. Labradors in particular are food-oriented and motivated. Reward desirable behavior with food and you’re likely to get a repeat of that good behavior.For example, if your Labrador is gnawing through your settee, encourage him to pick up his play toy and then reward him with a treat and make a great fuss of him. The treats can gradually give way to praise and over time, your Labrador will learn not to eat your settee.
Treats should be small, such as Mini Zukes, Charlie Bears, Bil Jac or freeze dried liver. Cooked kidney is a cheap alternative to buying dog treats and is also very easy to prepare and cut up. Many dogs will even work for their regular dog kibble.
Giving treats as a reward for the behavior you wish to encourage should be used only as a starting measure. Treats should soon be replaced with praise as the reward, otherwise the dog may become overweight or even obese.
Some trainers recommend having a dog with attention problems have to earn every kibble in his bowl, instead of being fed large meals at one time. That way, your dog is very focused on you and the food, making it easier to convey the message that he needs to “learn to earn.”, For instance, if your Labrador has taken to either launching himself at passers by or other dogs or barking at people and other dogs, then you should try to distract him. You need to temporarily interrupt your Labrador's stream of thought by talking to or commanding him or by an action (such as stomping your foot).


Anticipate and work on distraction techniques with treats in low distraction settings and at home. Make sure you follow through with praise and treats. As you get more confident where it is quiet, increase the level of difficulty by walking around the block or near a dog park to work on his skills. Gradually work up to busier areas once your Labrador is consistently responding to commands like “leave it” or “watch me”. Work up slowly to added distraction and you will both gain confidence in your Labrador's ability to handle a crowd.

, A professional dog trainer, such as one from the Association of Professional Dog Trainers (APDT), is very knowledgeable about dogs and can help you learn basic handling skills.You may need to start with a few private lessons to learn the basics before you and your Lab join a group lesson.
Though it is an added expense, having professional assistance is beneficial in the long run because it will help you and your energetic dog communicate effectively.
You may even consider consulting a veterinary behaviorist. These are veterinarians who have additional training and expertise in animal behavior. Your veterinarian can refer you to one of these specialists from the American College of Veterinary Behaviorists (ACVB)., They are wonderful dogs. Be fair, consistent, and clear. They'll reward YOU in turn with love and affection!

Crate train your dog.,
Set up a schedule.,
Take your dog to their elimination area.,
Reward your Golden Retriever for correct behavior.,
Watch for signs that your dog has to go out.",How to Train a Golden Retriever1," Crate training helps establish routine and boundaries for your Golden Retriever. You should put your dog into the crate when they sleep, when you have company, and when you are gone. This helps reduce accidents, along with other unwanted behaviors like chewing.Make sure you pick a crate big enough for your Golden Retriever. They should be able to comfortably stand and turn around. You will probably need a large crate, for dogs over 70 pounds. Choose one with ventilation on all sides, like a basic wire crate.
Golden Retrievers are very social and love being with their families. Place the crate in a common area in your home, not in a room no one uses. This helps your dog still feel like they’re part of the family.
Never treat the crate like a punishment. It should be your dog’s personal space where they feel comfortable. You should use it to help keep your dog confined when you can’t see them.;
, To help house train your Golden Retriever, you should set up a schedule for them. This helps them learn routine and figure out when they should go outside to use the bathroom. Try to walk them at the same time every day so they get into a routine.Set up a feeding schedule for your dog, too. This helps you estimate when they will need to go out.
When you first start training your Golden Retriever, take them out every hour or so, along with when you first get up and before you go to bed.

, Help your dog figure out where their elimination area is. Put them on a leash and walk them to the spot every time you take them out. Don’t let them play out there. Stay for about five minutes, and then return to the house even if they haven’t gone yet. Try again later. Your Golden Retriever will eventually figure it out., When your dog does their business in the elimination spot, give them a reward. This may be a treat or verbal praise. Provide the praise as soon as they finish, not when they are back inside the house., It’s important that you listen to your dog when they are trying to let you know they have to go out. Your dog may start sniffing around, walking around the house, dancing around, or standing by the door. If your dog starts stirring, take them out to be safe."

You should never use a metal choke collar as this could damage your Greyhound’s throat.You can find the leash and the martingale collar at your local pet store. A martingale collar is made up of two loops, a large loop that is adjustable and placed around your dog's neck, and a small loop, known as the control loop. The leash is clipped to the D ring on the small loop. When your dog tries to pull his head out of the collar, the tension on the leash will pull the small loop so it is taut, making the large loop smaller and tighter around his neck. This will prevent him from escaping.
A big part of training your dog is sticking to a daily walking schedule and using the leash to keep your Greyhound from running too fast or too far without you. Greyhounds hunt by sight and are bred to chase after prey. You will need to keep your Greyhound on a leash whenever he is out of the house or on a walk to keep him from running into the street while on the “hunt” for prey.
Make sure you can put two fingers under your Greyhound’s collar, this means there is enough slack for it be comfortable but not too much to allow your Greyhound to slip out of the collar.;
, Most Greyhounds are raised in crates and are very comfortable sleeping and relaxing in them. Greyhounds are known to be very clean animals and will likely not go to the bathroom in their crate. When you first bring your Greyhound home, it’s important that you do crate training to allow your Greyhound to get used to his new environment and to establish a training routine.Buy a large crate, at least 42 inches, to act as a safe space for your new Greyhound. You should place the crate in a room or area that gets a lot of traffic and family activity. Placing it in a remote location, like a basement or a room at the back of the house can make your Greyhound feel abandoned or ignored.

, Your Greyhound should see his crate as his safe space, so avoid sending him to his crate as punishment, especially when he first adjusting to his new environment. Rather than scolding him or enforce a harsh punishment, tell your Greyhound a firm “No” in a low voice when he does something wrong.Many newly adopted Greyhounds will go through a honeymoon period, where he acts quiet and controlled for the first week in his new home. Your Greyhounds full personality may not emerge until eight weeks after he enters your home.Never leave your Greyhound unattended in your home during the first several weeks of training, especially if he is not yet house trained. If you have to leave your dog unattended, put him in his crate to prevent any accidents.

, This will help your Greyhound learn the rules of his new home and respond to training. Your Greyhound may have been potty trained by his former owner or trainer, but he may act out by going to the bathroom in your home. You can prevent this by establishing a consistent walking and feeding schedule so your dog knows when it’s time to go to the bathroom and when it’s time to eat. Greyhounds are very active dogs and require lots of physical activity to remain happy and healthy.Greyhounds are prone to bloat, and allowing them to exert themselves soon after eating can increase this risk. Always wait at least 90 minutes after your Greyhound has eaten before you exercise him.

, Start the day with a 10 – 15 minute bathroom walk. If he does not relieve himself, bring him inside, confine him to the crate and feed him. Then, walk him again within 10 – 15 minutes of eating to allow him to go to the bathroom.Praise him when he goes to the bathroom with verbal praise and a treat. Most dogs will like to go to the bathroom in the same area or spot, so head to that spot during bathroom walks.

, Give him the same food every time you feed him, preferably a premium dog food that is made for Greyhounds. Ask your vet for pet food recommendations.Look for high quality dog food that does not contain corn, wheat, or wheat flour. You should also avoid dog food that contains meat by-products, as your Greyhound can choke on any beaks and feet in the food.


The average female Greyhound, weighing around 65 lb., should eat approximately 2 ½ – 3 cups per day. The average male Greyhound, weighing around 70 lb., should be fed approximately 3 – 4 cups per day. Always give your dog the same amount of food for each feeding session.Do not give your dog table scraps or canned dog food, as this can be hard on his digestive system and lead to health issues.
You should avoid letting your Greyhound drink a lot of water after eating. Only fill up his water bowl before a meal, as drinking too much water after eating can lead to bloating.

, Wait at least 90 minutes after he has eaten and take him on a second bathroom walk. Time your Greyhound’s second walk so it is right before you leave for work or leave for the day.After the walk, put your dog in his crate and praise him. You can also leave a cow hoof for your dog to chew on during the day. Some dog owners recommend leaving on the radio on a low setting to keep your dog company while you’re gone and put him at ease., Take your dog out of his crate and go for a 10 – 15 minute bathroom walk. Do not make a big fuss out of letting your dog out of his crate, as he could take this as a sign that being out of the crate is better than being in the crate.

, Give him an evening meal at the same time every night, with fresh water in his water bowl. Wait 10 – 15 minutes and take him on a bathroom walk. Praise him once he goes to the bathroom., You can then take your Greyhound on a recreational walk that is 15-30 minutes. Greyhounds love to go for walks so do not skimp on this part of the schedule.Always walk your Greyhound on his leash and keep him close to you during the walk. Greyhounds are sight dogs, so they can see up to a half-mile away and will likely run at 45 miles per hour if they spot a small animal or an object from far away. Your dog can also be sensitive to loud noises and get spooked. Prevent a runaway Greyhound by keeping him on a leash at all times during a walk.
Remember that Greyhound are house dogs and should not be left outside in the heat or the cold. Ensure your yard is fenced in so your Greyhound cannot run away or escape from your yard when you let him outside.

, Take your Greyhound on one more bathroom walk right before you go to bed. Praise him when he goes to the bathroom.You should withhold water at least three hours before bed and during the night to prevent any accidents or whining during the night to go outside.
You can then put your Greyhound in his crate for the night. Once your dog is housebroken, you can allow your dog to sleep on a dog bed in your bedroom, with the door closed.

, Greyhounds have difficulty sitting on their back legs and it may be easier to begin with teaching your Greyhound a simple command like ""wait"".


Start by putting a treat on the floor and holding your Greyhound's collar. Say the cue ""wait"" and place your other hand in front of his face, palm up.Hold him lightly by the collar for five seconds and then say ""ok"" or ""go get it"" while pointing at the treat. Release your hand from his collar and let your dog eat the treat.
Repeat this two three times several times a day. After a few times, he should learn to wait and not move forward for at least five to ten seconds until you point and say the release command.
Over time, you will not need to hold his collar and can use just the command and the signal. It can take several days or weeks to teach your dog this command, but it will be worth the effort. The ""wait"" command can be used to teach your Greyhound to stay put for five seconds at the curb before crossing the street or to be calm and patient before getting a treat.

, Keep in mind Greyhounds do not like to sit, as their long backs and well developed leg muscles can make the sitting position uncomfortable for them. If your Greyhound can get close to the ground in a sitting position, this could be an acceptable “sit” position., You should praise your Greyhound every time he follows a command and goes to the bathroom during a walk. The praise should be verbal, in a high pitched voice, followed by a physical patting of his head and a treat.When you reprimand your Greyhound, never raise your hand or yell. Instead, say the command “No!” in a low, clear voice. Do not send your Greyhound to his crate as punishment, as he will start to see the crate as a negative space.

, Many Greyhound do well in a structured training environment, such as an obedience course. If you adopt an ex-racing Greyhound, an obedience course can be very beneficial for both you and your new pet. Enroll your Greyhound after one to two months of living in the new home to give yourself time to learn your Greyhound’s full personality. At this point, your Greyhound will also be bonded to you and more open to training and commands from you.Greyhounds are very intelligent and can get bored quickly, so the training sessions will likely be short and end on a positive note. Look for an instructor has experience training Greyhounds, as she will be familiar with the breed’s temperament and body structure.

Let your pit bull sniff other dogs if the introductions go well.,

Know what to do if your dog gets too excited in off-leash situations.,
Socialize your pit bull with children when he's ready.,
Socialize your pit bull with strangers.",How to Train a Pit Bull3," Perhaps the most important part of training any dog, but especially pit bulls, is socialization. Start when your dog is a puppy for the best results, but a dog of any age can be socialized. Take your pit bull out so it can interact with other dogs and people. This will keep your dog friendly, as it will be used to other animals.


Many people recommend that you enroll your puppy pit bull in a puppy training class after he reaches six months. The right class can help him get accustomed to other dogs and to learn how to behave.

, Some pit bulls will simply not ever get along with other dogs, while others may be very friendly. It's important to know your dog's personality and to avoid forcing him to socialize with other dogs. But if you do think he's ready and willing to meet other dogs, try the following:


Introduce the dogs by walking them in a parallel direction with their leashes on, choosing a neutral territory so neither of them gets territorial.
Continue to walk the dogs a few feet apart, alternating between which dog is in the lead.
Don't let your dog run up to other dogs if he gets excited -- you're in control of his socializing.
If both dogs still have their leashes, make sure not to tangle them, or this can cause a fight.

, If the initial introduction worked well and the dogs seemed to get along, let them briefly sniff each other while standing perpendicularly to each other so that they still don't see each other head on. If either dog stiffens or stands up on his toes, pull the dogs apart before anything goes wrong.


You may have to take many walks before you can go past the introduction stage.

, If sniffing goes well, let your dog hang out in a fenced area with another dog. Let the dogs play with one dog on a leash and the other off the leash. The newer dog should be leashed and the fenced area shouldn't have too many items that can cause a fight, like bones or exciting toys. If the dogs are comfortable in this environment, take off their leashes and make sure that each owner stays near the dog to keep him in line.


Make sure to keep the dogs in an enclosed area throughout the encounter.
Keep around a squirt bottle to use on your dog in case things get out of line.
Don't let two pit bulls play together without full supervision. You never know what can happen.

, If your dog gets too excited around other dogs in off-leash situations, you should be able to pull him away before the excitement starts. Let's say you notice that it takes about 20 minutes for your dog to get too excited around other dogs. If that's the case, then pull him away after 10 or 15 minutes to avoid a conflict.


And if your dog is always excited around other dogs in an off-leash situation, or just has proven not to enjoy the company of other dogs, it's better to let him have his space than to force him to spend time with other dogs when he doesn't enjoy it.

, Your pit bull should trust you and should be trained and comfortable with following directions before you introduce him a child. If you introduce him to a child too early, he may indeed attack him. Therefore, wait to introduce him to children until you're confident that he knows right from wrong.


Pit bulls are actually known for loving children -- don't think that all pit bulls are mean to little kids.
Unfortunately, if you spend a lot of time with children and can't get your pit bull ready to get along with them, then you will have to find a new owner.

, If you want your pit bull to be able to get along with strangers, he has to earn your trust first. After that, if you invite strangers into your home, you need to tell them how to act to avoid upsetting your dog. The strangers should not approach the dog, touch the dog, or make eye contact with the dog. Instead, they should walk in slowly, and, in a sense, ""ignore"" the dog, which will give him time to smell them, to touch them, and to get used to their presence.


Once the dog is comfortable with the stranger, then they can slowly try to get closer to him.

Purchase a crate.,
Make the crate comfortable.,
Keep the crate nearby.",How to Crate Train Dachshunds1," For crate training to be a success, your dog must yield to its canine instinct to avoid soiling its sleeping area; as such, the crate should not be big enough for your dog to use one end as a bathroom. If you are crate training a fully-grown dachshund, look for a crate that measures roughly 24 inches by 36 inches, making it just large enough for your dog to stand up, stretch out, and move around a bit.If you are training a smaller dachshund puppy, consider a small plastic crate; both options are available for purchase at pet stores, hardware stores, or larger department stores.Consider using the larger crate to train your small puppy by blocking off part of it; this way, you can use the full crate when your dog matures.;
, The psychology of crate training works with a dog's instinctive desire to have a warm, safe place to sleep. Place blankets, a pillow, or a dog bed inside to make your dachshund comfortable in their crate. You can also add a sturdy chew toy to satisfy the energy and hunting instincts of the breed.If your dog is not housebroken, line the crate with thick, comfortable towels that can be easily removed and washed., Put the crate in a family room or central location in your home, where your dog will be able to see what is going on around it and feel like part of the action. Your dog should develop positive associations with its crate and see it as a refuge, rather than a source of isolation; dachshunds are an especially social breed, so this is an important consideration when crate training.one."

If used correctly, they can be a very effective training tool, especially the kind with a remote that allows you to monitor their behavior even when you aren’t standing right next to them.You should discuss the use of this type of collar with a trainer or veterinary behaviorist before deciding to purchase one. It may not be appropriate for your dog or to deter the specific behavior you wish to modify.


Remote dog collars can be used to modify behaviors like excessive barking, jumping, getting into things or places they shouldn’t, or even staying within the confines of specific physical boundaries (like an unfenced yard).
Remote dog collars are often best for dogs who are especially willful and have shown proven difficult to train with non-remote collars.
Note that the use of these collars in controversial, as they can increase possibility of abuse and may also be ineffective if you do not time the shock correctly.In addition, instead of deterring bad behavior, a shock collar can cause your dog to be fearful, which may lead to greater behavioral problems.A remote collar also may malfunction when you're not around, and you have no way to correct it. It may shock your dog even when it is not engaging in the behavior. Using the shock remotely also does not allow you to reinforce good behavior — the dog is shocked for the unwanted behavior, but gets no encouragement or reward for good behavior.;
, If you and the trainer have decided that a remote collar is the best choice, go to a pet store (or search online) for an electronic dog training collar. Some come with remotes and some don’t. The remote collars allow you to send a small shock to the collar by utilizing the remote manually. The remote-less electronic dog collars use sensors to detect the unwanted behavior — like sensing vibrations from barking or tracking the dog’s location within the boundaries you’ve established.Manually modifying behaviors can work well, except that you can’t monitor what you can’t see. So keep that in mind if you spend a lot of time away from your dog.

, Most dog collars have an established listing of weight/size recommendations for the dogs that will fit each collar size. Weigh your dog and measure their height ahead of time so that you can choose the right size.Collars should be loose enough to fit two fingers between the collar and the dog’s skin when they are wearing it.
Do not leave the dog alone while wearing the collar and check daily to ensure there are no sores forming. If your dog develops sores from their collar, take them to the vet for evaluation.

, There are many different ways to buy dog training collars conveniently on the internet. Websites like Amazon and Petsmart offer an easy opportunity for pet owners to search what’s available and make a decision about what is the right choice for their dog.You can usually guess the right size of collar to order for your pet based on the weight of your pet. Most collars will give you a weight range for each size collar.

, If you go to a pet store, there will be a variety of remote-free collars to take a look at. There will also be pet store employees to help you make an informed decision and to answer any questions you might have.Going to a pet store that allows dogs inside will mean that you can physically try the collar on to make sure it is the right size for your pet.
Decide which dog training collar is right for you. There are several different kinds of remote-free dog training collars. They vary in style and purpose, so deciding which one to get largely depends on what specific behaviors you want to correct in your dog. It is best to consult with a trainer before purchasing a training collar, as they can help you choose the best one for your dog's size, breed, and particular behavioral problems.

, This kind of collar is usually selected for strong dogs who like to be in charge during walks, are aggressive toward other dogs, or are extremely active and hart to control. The prongs on the inside push into the dog’s neck, causing discomfort, when they pull too hard while on a leash. Make sure you work with a trainer (and veterinary behaviorist, if necessary) to learn how to safely use this collar.This kind of collar is intended to help dogs learn to walk calmly next to their owners when on the leash, but many people disapprove of the method — inflicting discomfort to reinforce behavior.
They are also sometimes called pinch dog collars.
These are good for larger, strong dogs with especially muscular necks, like pit bulls, Dobermans, and German Shepherds.

, These collars are made of metal chains (though sometimes only partially made of metal and partially made of nylon or leather). If you wish to use one of these collars you must know how to properly use it or you risk injuring your dog. Work with a certified trainer to learn how to use a chain collar.The point of these collars is to prevent your dog from pulling when it is on a leash by creating tension in the metal part of the collar that presses against your dog’s throat and causes a choking sensation until your dog stops pulling.
They are also called choke chain collars.

Never use this type of collar on a short-nosed dog breed, such as Bull Dogs or Boxers.

, This kind of collar is actually a harness that goes around the dog’s neck and torso separately with a connecting piece in the middle. They are a popular option for training dogs into certain behaviors while they are walking on a leash.These collars are intended to train your dog not to pull while walking by pulling your dog’s body down toward the ground when they pull on the leash.
These work well for willful dogs who pull often and have trouble behaving on a leash.

, Wireless fences can be created inside or outside your home by simply setting up the transmitter inside and telling it how big you want the boundary to be. Then, you can work with your dog to show it where the boundaries are so that it can start learning the behavior.When your dog starts approaching the boundary, the collar will give your dog a warning chirp or vibration (depending on the model and the settings you choose).
If your dog continues on its path, it will receive a short little shock that will cause it a bit of discomfort and, in most cases, deter the behavior and keep your dog within the confines of your established boundary.
Shock or electric fences are controversial. One issue is that if your dog does break through the boundary (perhaps it sees a squirrel and charges through, receiving a shock), then the dog is less likely to return to the yard for fear of another shock. It may also cause your dog to become fearful. For instance, your dog may be afraid to go into the yard if they associate it with getting shocked and begin to toilet inside., To use most remote-free dog training collars, you’ll need to practice using them by taking your dog on a walk. Using the collar while you’re out walking around will help reinforce the behavior that you want to train into your dog.You can also try taking your dog to a more public place (like a dog park) where there are more distractions. This will help solidify the training.

, After some time using the training collar, you should be able to transition to regular collars and your dog should maintain the desired behavior. Be sure to praise your dog for maintaining the behavior that you want and give it treats when appropriate.If your dog resorts back to old behaviors, you may need to use the training collar for a longer period of time.

Give the “quiet” command when the “intruder” is out of sight.",How to Train a German Shepherd to Be a Guard Dog," In order to have a well-trained guard dog, you will need to start socializing your German shepherd from a young age.Puppies are more receptive to new things until they are about 18 weeks old. During this time, the things that they see, hear, and smell are less frightening. It is important to make sure that your German shepherd puppy is well-socialized during this time so that he will confident rather than anxious or fearful.To socialize your puppy, make sure that you expose the puppy to all sorts of different situations. Walk him past schools when kids are around, walk beside busy roads, take him out in the rain to see people with umbrellas, expose him to a vacuum cleaner and hair dryer, and introduce him to lots of other types of dogs and people. Try to make the experiences as wide and varied as you can.;
, To teach your German shepherd to be a guard dog, he will need to be well-behaved and you will need to train with him every day.The best way to go about this is to find a good trainer or obedience course to help you. Look for a dog trainer or training class in your area that uses modern, well-informed methods of training based on either clicker training or reward-based training.



Clicker training is a method of training that marks positive behavior with a clicking sound. Trainers who use this method also use rewards such as treats and praise, but the clicker helps to mark the good behavior.
Reward-based training uses praise, treats, and other things that will motivate your dog to follow your commands.
Do not use old-fashioned methods of dominating a dog, such as alpha-rolls or scruffing techniques. These methods are outdated and ineffective.

, Before your German shepherd can become a guard dog he needs to learn how to listen and respond to your commands. That is why it is a good idea to start with basic training commands such as sit, stay, and come back. Once your German shepherd has mastered basic commands, he will be ready to take on more challenging ones.

, Make sure your dog is well cared for, fed a good quality food, and receives plenty of exercise. You want the dog to be fit and mentally stimulated. A bored, out of condition dog is more likely to overreact in the face of an intruder, which may lead to one of your friends or neighbors getting injured.

, Train your dog daily, ideally in two to three sessions a day. Each session varies in length depending on the attention span of the individual dog, but German shepherds are often capable of being trained for 20 minutes at a time., Your German shepherd will enjoy training more if it always ends with a treat and some praise. If your German shepherd starts to make mistakes, bring the lesson to a close with a simple command that you know the dog is capable of doing. That way you will be able to reward him and end the session on a positive note.

, Make a noise that will make your dog bark, such as knocking on the door. After he starts barking, praise your dog and give him a reward. By following up his behavior with some praise, you will be letting your dog know that his behavior is good., Next, add a cue or label to the barking, such as “Speak.” Say this cue the next time you tap on the door to help your dog associate the behavior with the word. Make sure that you reward and praise him as well.

, When your dog stops barking, praise and reward him so he knows that being quiet is also good. If you dog does not stop barking, then you can distract him with a few small treats until he quiets down. Feed him pieces of a cut up hot dog or some other small treat one at a time to keep him quiet., The next time that you practice this command with your German shepherd, add the word ""Quiet"" to help him associate the behavior with the word. When German shepherd stops barking, then say “quiet” as soon as he stops and the give him is reward and praise.


If your dog needs to be distracted with treats, then say “quiet” as you are feeding him the treats., You will need to practice these commands with your German shepherd every day so that he will understand what you want him to do. Set aside a daily time slot of about 10-20 minutes to work on training.


After a while, try giving the cue word only to trigger the behavior. Start with ""Speak"" and when he starts barking, praise him and give him his reward. Then, say ""Quiet"" and reward the silence.

, You might want to train your German shepherd to bark when he hears potential intruders outside your house. To do this have a friend hang around outside. Then, have your friend make a little noise sufficient to trigger the dog's guarding instinct and wait for him to bark., After your dog starts barking at your friend, praise him and give him a treat to reward the behavior. Then, give him the “quiet” command to get him to stop barking. Make sure that you praise and reward him for being quiet as well., It is not a good idea to teach your dog to bark at strangers when you are out on walks or at the veterinarian’s office. To be a good guard dog, your German shepherd should not regard strangers as a threat. To reinforce calm behavior around strangers, praise and reward your dog when he is calm around people outside of your home., A good guard dog needs to be confident. To help your German shepherd develop some more confidence in his guarding abilities, you can stage a break-in with the help of a friend.Ask a friend to pretend to break into your house.


If your dog knows your friend, then you might want to have the friend put on a mask or wear a hoodie.

, First, make sure that you have control of your dog by keeping him on a leash or holding onto his collar. Then, have your friend come in through a window or sneak in the back door. When your dog starts barking at your friend, hold your dog’s collar and praise him. Then, have your friend run away and leave the house, as if he has been scared away by your dog.


This staged break-in will give your dog the message that his barking made the threat go away and he will feel more confident in his ability to guard and protect., When your friend is out of sight, give the ""Quiet"" command. Then, praise and reward your German shepherd for alerting you to the intruder and scaring him away.


Do not let your dog chase after your friend or he may do serious harm to him. That is why it is a good idea to keep your dog on a leash or have a tight hold on his collar to prevent him from going after your friend."

Designate a doggy zone for your yard.,
Create a pathway away from the garden.,
Train the dogs.",How to Discourage Dogs from Pooping in Your Garden2," Dogs do not defecate in gardens due to malicious intent. They are merely looking for a spot to relieve themselves and your garden looks welcoming. If you're dealing with your own dog, or a neighbor's dog whose presence you don't mind, you can try to create a welcoming atmosphere for the dogs away from the garden.


Pick a shaded area. Dogs prefer to stay out of the sun if possible. Make sure there is adequate room for dogs to run and play, and provide toys, food, water, and treats to entice the dog to enter that area over the garden.Use a dog-friendly surface, like wood chips, bark chips, or leaves. A mix of sand and soil is a particularly good option as dogs love digging and such a mixture is soft and easy on their paws.Use positive reinforcement. Praise dogs for entering the doggy zone and reward them with treats.

, Sometimes, dogs end up going in gardens because they pass through on their way elsewhere. Create a pathway near the garden, but one that does not go through it. If it's smoother and more welcoming, the dog will likely opt for this path and forgo disrupting your plants.


Soft, dog-friendly mulch can be used to make the path. A spare piece of carpet, if you have it, is also a good choice, as is a soil/sand mixture.For a choice that's pleasant for dogs and adds beauty to the garden, you could try stone steps or colorful tiles. Cement pathways are also a popular choice, and can be used by humans as well as dogs. The only downside, however, is making a cement path can get costly and installation may be difficult., If you ever catch a dog in the act, take this as an opportunity to make it clear to the dog that this behavior is not okay. Dogs are natural people pleasers and generally respond well to training.


Clap your hands loudly to get the dog's attention and interrupt his actions. Say, ""No,"" and immediately direct him out of your garden.If you have a designated dog-friendly zone in your yard, redirect the dog there. If not, take him to the street and allow him to relieve himself himself on a curb or sidewalk.
Get your neighbors on board. If you have a neighborhood where dogs run free, and they seem to have chosen your garden as a bathroom, discuss this with your neighbors. Ask them politely to join you in your efforts to discourage the dogs from using your garden as a restroom.

Manipulate your choice of fertilizers.,
Clean the area thoroughly.,
Use repellents to keep dogs out.",How to Discourage Dogs from Pooping in Your Garden3," Sometimes, the fertilizers we're using are inadvertently attracting dogs to our garden. Changing how and when you use fertilizer can be a great way to discourage dogs from getting into your yard.


Dogs react strongly to new smells and odors, and may be put off if a smell suddenly changes. This can signal to them that another animal has potentially infiltrated their space. Switch up with fertilizers you use periodically to make dogs wary of entering your garden.
Organic fertilizers are great, but can sometimes contain smells that attract dogs. Look up information on the fertilizer you're using online to see if anyone has had issues with a particular fertilizer in terms of it attracting dogs.
Oftentimes, people are tempted to use rabbit or deer repellents in conjunction with fertilizers to keep dogs at bay. The problem is, such repellents often contain coyote urine and this attracts dogs. Avoid such repellents when trying to keep dogs out of your garden., Dogs are likely to return to the same spot if they believe it's dog friendly. When a dog uses your garden as a bathroom, they leave their scent behind and other dogs assume relieving themselves in this space is okay. Clean the area thoroughly after finding dog feces.

Dog's often pee in the same places they defecate. Dog urine can leave burn marks on grass and plants, so douse the area with a hose shortly after removing the feces. This neutralizes the acidity of the urine and lessens its effect on the garden.You can also rake compost into the area, which contains soil organisms that balance soil biology and chemistry. Just be sure to move any compost bags well out of a dog's reach.Throw any fecal matter into a closed dumpster, after sealing it in a plastic bag. You don't want the smell to attract more dogs to the area.

, Whether home made or store bought, a variety of repellents cause unpleasant smells and sensations that will discourage unwanted dogs from entering your garden.


Garlic, olive oil, and almond oil have been known to keep dogs away when sprinkled on or around plants or in the soil surrounding a garden.Ammonium and vinegar provide small smells that drive dogs away. Placing ammonium or vinegar soaked cotton balls around the garden, especially in places where dogs have defecated previously, may be effective in keeping pets out.Oftentimes, home remedies are hit or miss. There are specially made dog repellents, sold online or at pet stores, that are environmentally safe and not harmful to dogs or other animals. Some can be quite expensive, in the $60 to $70 range, while others sell for about $12.Some sites recommend citrus and cayenne pepper as a deterrent. This should be avoided. Citrus can be potentially harmful to dogs. While not every dog will have a negative reaction to citrus, it has caused health effects for some dogs in the past so it's best to err on the side of caution.Cayenne pepper causes irritation in a dog's face, skin, and paws. You do not want to inadvertently harm your own dog or a neighbor's dog in attempt to keep them out of the garden.

Act nonchalant and relaxed around your dog.,
Close blinds or windows.,
Play calming music.,
Provide a safe area.,
Dress your dog in a ""thundershirt."",
Distract your dog.,
Use anti-anxiety medication.",How to Comfort Your Dog1," While you may feel compelled to comfort your dog with snuggling, treats, and petting, this can actually reinforce the fearful behavior.Instead, do your best to behave normally, treating your dog as you always would, and pretend not to notice her fear.This may be difficult and seem cruel, but petting and feeding your dog treats when she is afraid is in fact rewarding the behavior you are trying to stop.;
, If your dog cannot see (or hear) outside, it may help him to forget about what's happening. Close any windows, curtains, or blinds to help comfort your dog.Take him to an area of the house where he’s less likely to be disturbed.

, The sound of music may help to drown out distressing sounds. What’s more, studies have shown that classical music can have a very calming effect on dogs in stressful situations.Begin with something classical, like Mozart.
Experiment with different types of music to see what your dog enjoys.

, If your dog has a crate, allow her to lie in it during the storm. If no crate is available, create a cozy den with blankets and dog items. Place some laundry that smells like you in the safe area to add a soothing effect.If using a crate, it may help to drape a blanket over it. Leave the door to the crate open so she doesn’t feel trapped.
Don’t close your dog in a room. Allow her to have some space without feeling trapped.

, A thundershirt is a snug garment designed to target calming pressure points. This has a similar effect to swaddling a baby, and can be very calming to your dog when he's distressed.Place the garment on your dog.
Use the velcro straps to tighten.
This can also be used to calm him in the car.

, Engage in fun activities that your dog likes. This will keep her mind off the storm and help her to cope.Toss a ball.
Wrestle with chew toys.
Try playing toys that dispense food or treats.

, If your dog’s anxiety is severe, schedule an appointment with his vet to talk about it. Ask about prescription anti-anxiety medication options.You may try the dog versions of Xanax, Klonopin, or Diazepam.
Most commonly, these are used for separation anxiety, but can also be used for severe noise-induced distress.
Follow the instructions your veterinarian provides.

Take your puppy outside frequently.,
Feed your puppy at the same time every day.,
Pick a designated place for your puppy to relieve herself outside.,
Use a command to help your puppy associate the spot with relieving herself.,
Reward your puppy when she relieves herself outside.,
Confine your puppy to a certain area in the apartment.,
Consider having an indoor bathroom spot.,
Keep your puppy in a crate at night and while you're away.,
Clean up accidents right away.,
Don't scold your puppy for having an accident.Puppies don't respond well to negative reinforcement; it only makes them afraid.",How to Potty Train a Puppy in an Apartment," A young puppy (8 weeks) needs to be given the opportunity to go outside every 20 minutes, if you are to increase the chances of her peeing outside rather than inside. Older puppies also need to relieve themselves frequently, as they can't physically hold their bladder for more than an hour or two.To avoid accidents, scoop up your puppy and take her outside once an hour like clockwork. This way your puppy will learn to associate going outside with going to the bathroom.


Once you get to know your puppy, you'll be able to watch for signs she needs to relieve herself. As soon as you see her displaying the signs, take her outside.
When you're house training a puppy, it's very important that you be available to meet her needs at all times of the day. If you leave her alone in the apartment all day it might take a very long time for her to understand what she's supposed to do when she needs to go to the bathroom. If you can't be with her all day long, have a friend stay with her.;
, This helps to reinforce a routine and allows you to better predict when she may need to go outside. Depending on your puppy's breed and needs, feed her a few times a day. Take your puppy outside after every meal and after she drinks a lot from her water bowl.

, Going to the same spot every time will help her remember what she's supposed to do. Living in an apartment building, you might have trouble getting all the way to the closest park. Pick a patch of grass close enough to your apartment entrance that your puppy won't have an accident on the way.


Be sure to follow your city's ordinances regarding disposing of dog waste. Pick up after your puppy using a plastic bag.
Dog urine isn't generally good for flowers, so try to find a public spot that isn't being tended by a careful gardener. You might find yourself the subject of a sign warning dog owners to stay away - a common sight near city apartment buildings!

, Say something like ""go potty"" or just ""potty"" when you set her in the designated spot. Use language to strengthen the puppy's association with the spot. Make sure you don't use the word indoors; just use it in the special spot.

, The best way to train a puppy is to reinforce good behavior and eliminate possibilities for bad behavior. When your puppy relieves herself outside, giving her praise and a treat will make her want to do it again. Say ""good girl"" or ""good boy"" in a loving tone and give your puppy some cuddles. You can also give her a small treat each time she goes correctly.


In order for positive reinforcement to work effectively as a training strategy, consistency is key. That means that every single time your puppy relieves herself outside, you should praise her. This is especially important in the first few months, when she's still learning correct behavior.

, You can gate off your kitchen using a child or dog gate or choose a different room. This is necessary during the first few months, since keeping your puppy in one place allows you to keep an eye on her so you can take her outside right away when she shows signs of needing to relieve herself. If she has too much freedom, she'll end up going to the bathroom before you can catch her to take her outside.


Your puppy is ready to spend time in the rest of the apartment after she has learned to signal to you that she needs to go outside, either by moving toward the door or looking at it. You'll also know she's ready when she has very few accidents in the apartment.

, If your apartment is on a high floor in your building, it might be difficult to get outside in time for your puppy to go to the bathroom. If you have a small dog who makes manageable messes, you can consider paper training your dog instead of taking her outside every time. Line an area of the room with newspapers or special training pads you can buy at the pet store. Use the same training method you'd use for an outdoor bathroom spot, carrying your puppy to the papers each time she has to go. Reward her when she goes successfully.You can also use a sod box as a place for your puppy to eliminate. Fill a shallow plastic container with sod or dog litter, and place it on top of newspapers.When you clean up after an accident your puppy has had, you can place the soiled paper towels or rags in the designated area so that your puppy associates the the smell of urine with her bathroom spot.

, Puppies actually like the feeling of being in a small, cozy crate - it makes them feel safe and secure. For this reason you should never use a crate as a form of punishment; it should be your puppy's personal safe place. Puppies don't like soiling their living space, so make sure you take your puppy outside so she can go to the bathroom right before you put her in the crate.


Puppies can sleep for about 4 hours before they need to relieve themselves. Very young puppies might wake up barking, though, so you should line the crate with towels just in case your puppy has an accident in the night.
If you hear your puppy barking in the crate, take her outside to relieve herself and place her back in the crate. Be sure you reward her when she relieves herself.

, If your puppy has an accident in her crate or elsewhere inside, be sure to clean it up and sanitize the spot so it no longer smells like urine. If an area smells like urine the puppy will instinctively want to relieve herself in the same spot again.

, If your puppy is relieving herself in your apartment, pick her up and immediately take her outside to the designated bathroom spot. When she successfully finishes doing her business there, reward her before taking her back inside.


Never yell at your puppy or spank her when you see her having an accident. You will teach your puppy to be afraid of you, and it won't help her learn what to do when she needs to relieve herself.
If you find a mess in your apartment after the deed has been done, don't ever rub your puppy's nose in it or try to discipline her. It doesn't work; it just confuses the puppy. Simply clean up the mess and take the puppy outside more often to continue her training.

A puppy doesn’t understand that it is “bad” behavior to urinate on your carpet. To your puppy, the carpet is an acceptable surface, just like the grass outside. You must teach the puppy the better choice.;
, The initial act of housebreaking your dog is more fortuitous than anything. Taking him out to go often will lead to him going outside by coincidence. He will start to understand the behavior you want to cultivate when you praise him for the happy accident. Though, it will still take time and many repetitions.


If you catch your puppy eliminating in the house, interrupt the act. Use an interrupting command such as, “Outside!” Don’t yell or scold when issuing the command. Just use the command to interrupt the puppy and stop him from going.
Scoop the puppy up and take him to his designated potty spot outside. If he finishes in the correct spot, issue the appropriate praise and/or treats.Be sure to use the same place outside each time. Taking your puppy out on a leash is the ideal method for keeping them to one area.

, Your puppy won’t understand why you’re punishing. Scolding and physical responses will only instill fear in your puppy. This can often make the puppy try to eliminate in hidden areas around the home away from your presence.Serious behavior problems beyond housebreaking can develop when you don’t use positive training methods.

, The age of your puppy has a bearing on the puppy's ability to be house-trained and the amount of time you can take between potty breaks. Do not take accidents as being difficult. Compare them to a baby still learning to control his bladder.A general guide is as follows:Between 8 and 16 weeks of age is considered the prime socialization period for puppies.At this point, your puppy can only hold his bladder for around 2 hours. It is also the best time to start housebreaking.
At 16 weeks, a puppy can usually hold his bladder for up to four hours. Prior to this, the bladder can withstand about 2 hours before the puppy must go.At 4-6 months, puppies in this age group can often seem ""half"" house trained due to their ability to be easily distracted. He's likely to want to explore the world, which means chasing a moth might prevent him from eliminating when you take him to his spot. By now, a puppy of four months can wait about four to five hours before needing to eliminate, while a puppy of six months can go as long as six or seven hours.
When a dog reaches 6-12 months, sexual maturity can cause males to raise their legs and pee on furniture, while females can come on heat. The bladder can cope with seven to eight hours before needing to eliminate.
At 12-24 months, your puppy may not be fully mature yet depending on the breed. Hopefully you've established house training long before this age, but if not, you can still do so, even for adult dogs. Although not impossible, housebreaking older dogs that have developed bad habits generally requires much more energy and diligence on your part than doing it “right” the first time as a puppy.

, Larger dogs tend to be easier to house train than toy dogs. Smaller dogs need to go more frequently (with tinier digestive systems).Smaller dogs can also get into places to eliminate where you may not notice or be able to find until a bad habit has been established. Limit your dog’s access to the whole house to prevent this.

, Crate training your puppy is a great way to help the puppy learn bladder control.The crate also gives security. When you're around, leave the crate door open for going in and out as needed. Leave toys, treats, and comfy bedding inside. The crate should be a happy place, not a place for punishment.


Some dogs take to a crate right away, and others need a more gradual introduction to the crate.
At some point in your dog’s life, he will probably have to get into a crate. The vet, travel, and grooming visits all require your dog to be confined. It is better to get him used to one while he is young.
Puppies under 6 months old should never be left in their crate for more than 3 to 4 hours regardless of bladder control. They need more interaction.If you have to work during the day, hire a dog-walking service to come let your puppy out appropriately.
When you come home after crating your puppy, you can immediately take your puppy outside and not give him the opportunity to make a mistake in the house.

, Size the crate so the puppy can stand up, turn around, and lie down. It should not be so big that the puppy can eliminate in one corner and sleep in another. The idea is to use the natural instinct to avoid sleeping in your own mess to help with the housebreaking process. If you have a large breed puppy, there are crates designed to “grow” with your puppy, so you don’t have to waste money buying bigger sizes as they age. If you don’t have a crate, you can use a section of your bathroom partitioned with a baby gate., This spot might be somewhere in the backyard, next to a structure that provides shelter from wind, or some other suitable place in the garden. Wherever it is, have a firm commitment to it before getting the puppy. You don't want to create inconsistent messages by shifting his toilet around the yard while you make up your mind., Putting your puppy on a feeding schedule can make your efforts much more successful. A puppy allowed to eat whenever he wants will make house training difficult. Also, developing a schedule to take your puppy outside will make it easier on you. Always take a puppy outside within 15 to 20 minutes after meals like clockwork.

, The most important thing of all when house training a puppy (or dog) is consistency. If you are consistent, and do the same thing and expect the same action every single time, your puppy will catch on very quickly. On the other hand, changing your actions and expectations will confuse your puppy. Create a predictable and consistent routine for your puppy.Take your puppy out:When he wakes up in the morning—or before if you manage to get up before the puppy.
After each and every meal. Puppies usually need to eliminate within 20 minutes of eating.
After each and every nap.
After each and every play period.
Before he goes to bed for the night. Puppies between 8 and 14 weeks of age will likely need to eliminate during the night. Keep them crated in your bedroom so that you can hear them whine to be let out. Keep the leash, your slippers, and your robe at the ready.

, After he has been introduced to his new surroundings, give him a drink of water and immediately take him outside to the predetermined spot.

, Your puppy may start to understand that he should eliminate outside before he understands how to let you know he needs to go. Watch for telltale signs that a puppy has a full bladder. Look for: barking or scratching at the door through which you take your puppy out, squatting, restlessness, and sniffing around or circling.If you observe one of these behaviors, especially when you haven’t taken your puppy out recently, then it’s probably time for him to go.

, In addition to taking your puppy to a designated spot consistently, you may also want to develop a specific command that your puppy can associate with a potty break, such as, ""Go potty,"" ""Hurry up,” or whatever you choose., Make sure you only use the assigned potty command for the process of housebreaking. Use it every time you take the puppy out. This allows the puppy to associate this act with the exact command. This will help in the future when traveling, visiting relatives/friends, etc.

, In order for a puppy to associate the praise with the act, praise him right after he finishes before going back inside.Praise the puppy after he finishes and don’t interrupt the “flow.” Some puppies are so sensitive that they may stop in the middle of eliminating if you praise them too soon. They may even think that you just wanted them to squat in order to get a treat. The timing of praise is important.
Remember that freedom is a reward too. Have some fun playing after the puppy has eliminated. You don’t want the puppy to think the fun stops as soon as he eliminates. You want the fun to continue so the puppy wants to hurry up and eliminate and start the fun stuff.

, Whenever you take puppy out at a designated time, if the puppy eliminates within 3-5 minutes, praise them and place them in the pen surrounding the crate giving them more freedom. If they do not eliminate within 3-5 minutes, place the puppy inside the crate and close the door. Leave them crated for 15-20 minutes and stay close by. After the short waiting period, take the puppy outside again, if they eliminate, they get more freedom in the larger area. If they do not, they go back in the crate.


Puppy will whine instead of going in the crate, so by paying attention, you can help force the proper behavior, allowing you to then reward puppy and show the puppy the extra freedom that comes from the appropriate behavior.

, If you live by yourself with your puppy, this step will be easy. If your puppy lives in a house with more than one person, make sure that everyone is taking the steps to make the house training process quick and easy. The closer everyone sticks to the plan, the faster the training will progress.

, Roughly 2.5 hours before bedtime, take up your puppy’s water dish.This will help ensure that puppy’s last trip out just before bed is good enough to last overnight. Most puppies can sleep for approximately seven hours without having to eliminate, so if you take the water dish up well before bed, then your puppy should have fewer accidents overnight.If your puppy does wake you up in the night because he needs to go, keep the trip out short and to the point. If you turn on too many lights or play at all, then your puppy will think it’s play time and might start to think it’s okay to wake you up for that instead of just potty breaks.Simply take him out and then return him to his bed.

, Hardwood and tile floors should be wiped cleaned and sprayed with a disinfectant. Carpets need to be cleaned with a carpet cleaner. This is probably the most important step because dogs have such a great sense of smell. If they can still smell the urine or feces, they will continue to eliminate in the same spot.This is also why the dog should remain on leash inside the house for many months before allowing free range of the whole house.


Many people get commercial cleaners at the supermarket. Many of these products contain ammonia. Ammonia smells like urine to your dog. So if your dog urinates on the carpet and you clean with an ammonia product, your dog will come back to that spot and think that a strange dog has gone on the carpet. Your dog will eliminate again on that same spot to cover it.
Commercially produced pet mess cleaners contain special enzymes that eradicate the urine odor that attracts the puppy back to the same spot. These can be purchased from pet stores, online sources, your veterinarian, and discount department stores. They are the most effective means of removing, not just covering up, the odor.Some people say that white, distilled vinegar and water work well when followed up with baking soda.

, Do your best to set the puppy up for success and minimize the opportunities to have “accidents” by using crates, dog pens, baby gates, and leashes to control the areas to which your puppy has access.


The area surrounding the crate does not have to be much bigger that four to six feet around when the puppies are small. The area around the crate will increase gradually as the dog gets more housebroken and as large breed puppies get bigger. The more control the dog has, the more “freedom” they earn.

, Allow longer periods only when you are sure he will ask to go out when he has to go. This strategy should not take more than two weeks for him to get the picture.

, Your puppy may revert to eliminating inside again after you thought he was trained. This can happen for a number of reasons, such as sexual maturity, change of routine, curiosity overwhelming the need to go at the usual time, etc. Resume the consistent routine you used to housebreak your puppy. He will quickly start obeying the routine again., A doggie door is great if you have a proper fence (one that a puppy cannot get under or over) and a gate. Even if you do have a proper fence, be aware of area wild animals that might eat your puppy such as coyotes, etc.


Don't leave your dog unattended outside for long periods of time.

, If you don’t have a backyard, a doggie door, or someone who can come let your puppy out while you’re away, you can still use a paper-training method to get a puppy to eliminate in a designated indoor spot. This is just an extra precaution in case the puppy needs to go and cannot wait for you to return home. Place newspaper or a small, accessible box out for the puppy. Since the puppy will want to eliminate in a spot where he can smell previous urine or feces, you can place the rags you used to clean up previous accidents in the box.Some people hold that spreading newspapers suggests that peeing in the house is acceptable. They therefore advocate skipping the newspaper and dealing with any messes. Every owner has to start somewhere. If that means cleaning up a few messes, then that's what's going to be best for your dog and family.
Using newspapers may delay the process a bit, but if you gradually decrease the size of the newspapered area and eliminate messes in undesignated areas of the house completely, you will still be successful. You will be using confinement to a smaller area to limit the puppy’s access to the whole house.

, If you go on trips, have somebody look after the puppy. If you live with your family or friends, have them look after him. If your whole family has gone, have somebody who knows about puppies come down and babysit. Tell him or her your schedule, where they sleep, what to feed them, what not to feed them, etc. You can also use a kennel—a place where people look after dogs/puppies while you are gone.


Remember, that if the puppy is “forced” to eliminate in the kennel because of the boarding facility’s schedule, you will have taken a large step backward in the training process. Both options have pluses and minuses you will need to consider for your situation.

Leash train your Golden Retriever.,
Teach your dog to sit.,
Train your Golden Retriever to come.",How to Train a Golden Retriever2," Golden Retrievers are large dogs, so you don’t want them running around wherever they want. Work on leash training your dog. Start by taking them for short walks. If they start to pull on the leash, stop walking and stand there. Don’t move or let the dog go the way they want. Start walking again when they come back to you, sit, or let some of the tension from the leash.Reinforce the positive behavior of not pulling on the leash with praise or treats.
If your Golden Retriever gets too excited and starts jumping around before you place the leash on them, wait until they calm down to put the leash on them.

, Teaching your Golden Retriever to sit is important. The sit command is the basis of almost every other command that you teach them. You can use the sit command to enforce basic obedience.Tell your dog to “sit” as you hold a treat over their head. Move the treat back and forth until they sit. You can also push their hind section down to achieve the desired action. As soon as they sit, give them verbal praise and let them eat the treat.
Eventually, stop moving your dog and instead use a hand signal or verbal cue. The dog should respond and sit, or learn it with repeated practice.

, Teaching a Golden Retriever to come when you call them is important to your dog’s overall behavior. It can help keep them out of trouble and improve their life since you can take them more places.Use positive reinforcement to get your dog to come. They should associate coming to you with praise, treats, or toys.
Say the word “come” as you walk backwards. The dog should want to follow you. Say the word once before you move backwards. This helps your dog associate the verbal command with the desired behavior.
Keep moving backwards until your dog gets to you. You want the dog to understand that they have to come all the way to you.
Add additional distractions, like toys or food, as your Golden Retriever gets better at the command.
Make sure to only say the command once. Repeating it makes it lose meaning for the dog. If the dog won’t come to you, try running farther away or tempting them with a treat. As soon as your dog comes to you, give them praise or treats.

"
"
Be patient.,
Use positive reinforcement.,
Provide plenty of rewards for your dog.",How to Train a Golden Retriever3," Golden Retrievers are smart dogs who can be trained. However, they won’t be trained overnight. Keep your expectations reasonable as you train your dog. Understand that it may take them awhile to learn the command, but with persistence and having them repeat the action over and over, they will learn it.


Stay calm. Getting upset doesn’t build trust between you and your Golden Retriever. Getting mad also can upset your dog, causing them to act out.

, Positive reinforcement is one of the most effective ways to train your Golden Retriever. Dogs respond well to treats or praise when they do an action, and they naturally want to do the same thing again. This helps you show your dog what behavior you desire, and they know they will receive some sort of positive reward for complying.Ignore unwanted behaviors. If you respond, this is reinforcing them by giving them attention. Ignoring the behaviors shows that the dog won’t get a reaction from you, so there is no reason to do them.

, You can use a variety of treats with your dog. Make sure they are small enough that they don’t have to take a long time eating it. At the same time, use verbal praise, like saying, “Good job!”. You may also pet the dog or give them physical attention.Make sure to provide the reward immediately after the action. Don’t wait until later. The dog has to know that the treat comes from that behavior.

Let your dog explore.,
Feed your dachshund in the crate.,
Attempt to crate the dog for longer periods.",How to Crate Train Dachshunds2," When you first set up your dachshund’s crate, take the door off (or prop open the door, if this isn't possible) and allow the dog to explore it freely. If your dog does not approach the crate on its own, use gentle encouragement; drop treats near the entrance to the crate, or toss treats and toys inside to encourage your dog to go in. This process may take several days, so time and patience are absolutely necessary. Once your dog warms up to the crate, re-attach the door., If your dog enters the crate willingly, begin feeding it regular meals in there to create positive associations. If your dog eats inside without making a fuss for several, consecutive meals, try closing the door during mealtime; open the door as soon as it finishes its meal. If it whines, cries, or acts aggressively as a result of being in the crate, shorten the time that the door is closed and open it sooner; if your dog seems comfortable, prolong the time, keeping the door closed for an additional ten minutes after it finishes eating., Once your dachshund is comfortable with the process of eating in its crate, start practicing longer crating periods. Gently coax it towards the crate with a treat; encourage your dog to go in, then close the door behind it and feed it the treat. Stay in the room and sit by the crate for about 5-10 minutes; leave the room and wait another 5 minutes or so before returning to let your dog out. Repeat this process several times a day, and gradually increase crating time.Dachshunds can be irritable and quick to bite, so be cautious when coaxing your pet into the crate and letting it out after."
"
Leave the house.,
Crate your dachshund at night.,
Let your dog relieve itself immediately.,
Ensure that your dog is warm and comfortable.",How to Crate Train Dachshunds3," If your dachshund has passed the test of longer crating times at home, and can be in his crate for a full 30 minutes without getting anxious or scared, have it stay in its crate while you leave the house for a short period of time. Get your pet into the crate between 5-20 minutes before you go, and keep your exit low key; this will prevent your dog from getting anxious about you leaving. Similarly, keep your arrival at home low key to prevent your dog from getting hyper. Continue crating your dog while you are home to prevent negative feelings of loneliness or abandonment being associated with the crate., Place the crate in your bedroom and have your dachshund sleep in it at night. This will prevent your dog from feeling abandoned or scared, and will allow you to let it out if it needs to relieve itself. If you note that your dog is whining simply to be let out, ignore it; giving in when your dog misbehaves will reward a negative behavior that you are trying to eradicate. , Take your dog out to eliminate as soon as possible after long crating periods; dachshunds are already difficult to housebreak, so it is important to encourage your dog to relieve itself outside as opposed to anywhere else. Letting your dog out right after crating periods will build confidence in the fact that its needs will be met if it cooperates. You should make it a habit to let your dog relieve itself right before crating it, as well.

, Dachshunds don’t like the cold, so it may be difficult to persuade your pet to go outside to relieve itself if it is cold or raining. This aversion may, in turn, encourage your dachshund to relieve itself inside, which is why crate training is so important for this breed. Accommodate your pet as much as possible by setting up a covered potty yard behind your home, or by dressing it in a coat or cover to keep it warm."
"
Praise progress.,
Keep crating time in check.,
Keep the crate.",How to Crate Train Dachshunds4," Your Dachshund’s crate training relies a lot on the positive reinforcement your dog receives for behaving itself. Use encouragement and rewards (e.g. treats, toys) to promote your pet’s good behavior. Allow it to associate being obedient and relieving itself outside with happy things., Crate training is an effective tool for modifying dog behavior, but it is not a long-term solution to caring for your pet. Dachshunds, in particular, are energetic, social pets that need lots of play and interaction with their owners. Crate time should be kept to a minimum once they are trained, and used to either keep your dog from destroying your belongings at times when you are not available to stop it, or for transport., If your dog has developed an affinity for its crate during training, consider leaving it out as a permanent “den” for your dachshund. While crate training is generally a short-term arrangement to teach your dog good behavior or to housetrain it, it is important for your pet to have a comfortable, stress-free place to be confined when necessary- such occasions might include car rides, visits to the kennel or veterinarian's office, renovation periods in your home, or if your dog is recuperating from an injury or illness. It is a good idea to maintain your dog’s positive associations with the crate in case you need to use it again down the line."

Give your dog space.,
Provide structure for your dog.,
Give your dog her own things.,
Introduce him to everyone in the house.,
Give your dog lots of attention and love.",How to Comfort Your Dog2," When you bring a new dog home, it is important to let her explore her surroundings. Let her wander inside, or in a fenced-in backyard for some time alone. If she has a crate or other bed, allow her to explore it privately. This will help her feel comfortable in her new home. , Dogs are inherently pack animals. When you bring a new dog into your home, you are inviting him into your pack. Allow him to assimilate by establishing a structure. This will make his transition a comfortable one.Feed your dog at the same time(s) each day.
Walk him at roughly the same time too.
Be consistent with how you discipline him.

, It will provide a great source of comfort to a new pet for her to have her own things. The most essential items are food and water bowls, toys, and places to rest.Food and water bowls should not slide around on the ground.
Toys should be safe for dogs.
Places to rest can be anywhere for your dog to take a break and be alone, like a crate, dog bed, or just a quiet room with some of her toys.

, It is important for your pet to meet everyone that he will be living with. You don’t want to overwhelm him, so it is best to do these introductions one at a time. Allow him to smell each person and get used to them.Try placing one piece of dirty laundry from each member of the household near the dog’s crate or where he sleeps.

, Just like humans, dogs like to feel loved. Studies have shown that pets that receive daily affection have longer life expectancies than those who do not.But petting and playing are not the only ways to show affection to your dog.


Include your dog in daily activities.
Allow her to help out with chores by training her to hand you things that you need.
Praise your dog when her behavior meets your expectations of her.

"
Find out what is wrong.,
Let her eat grass.,
Keep him hydrated.,
Feed her rice.,
Give him over-the-counter (OTC) medicine.,
Take her to the vet.",How to Comfort Your Dog3," Take note of your dog’s symptoms, and exactly when they began. Try to be as specific as possible.Once you can determine the problem, you can begin to comfort him.


Things to look for include: loss of appetite, lethargy, and vomiting.
Use an online “symptom checker” for dogs to help determine possible causes.
Call and speak to your vet. Relay the symptoms over the phone and determine the best course of action.

, If your dog is eating grass, she may have an upset tummy. Eating grass can tickle her throat and tummy and may induce vomiting. This can be very comforting for dog’s with gas or upset tummies., Especially if your dog has diarrhea, dehydration can be a serious concern. Comfort your dog by offering him plenty of water. Try offering him water straight from a hose or faucet, or water with ice cubes. This might spice things up for him and help him to get more water down.
You can obtain an electrolyte powder for animals from any farm store. Mix this with water for additional prevention or treatment of dehydration.
You can check to see if your dog is dehydrated by lifting up his lip and examining his gums. If healthy, his gums should be covered with a shiny film.
If your dog is very dehydrated, get him to the vet right away. Dehydration can lead to organ damage or even death.

, If your dog as an upset tummy, feeding rice to your dog can give her some comfort.Boil one cup of white rice in one quart of water, until mushy.
Drain some of the water, and feed this rice water to your dog. This is both soothing to the tummy and hydrating.
Feed her some of the mushy, drained rice. You can mash it with a fork for a softer consistency. You can also mix with other food that she likes.

, Just like in humans, OTC medicines like bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) can soothe diarrhea or stomach symptoms. Give 1 teaspoon per 5 pounds, or 1 tablespoon per 15 pounds. Do this every two hours.Call your vet to see if giving your dog some medicine is a good idea.
OTC medications should never be used on dogs who are pregnant or nursing.
Never give Pepto-Bismo to cats!

, It is not abnormal for a dog to have an upset tummy or other illness once in awhile. However, if your pet is seriously ill, she may need to be seen by a professional.Contact your vet in the event of:


Vomiting or diarrhea persisting more than 24 hours
Seizure
Difficulty breathing
Moaning with pain
Trouble urinating

Don’t punish your dog for accidents.",How to House Train Your Dog Quickly," Before you start your house training plan, you need to ensure that your home is free from urine stains and residual odors. Once you’ve gotten rid of any odors and stains, your dog will not be attracted to certain areas of the house to use as a potty.


Purchase a black light and a pet odor remover from your local pet store. When it is dark, turn off all the lights and thoroughly inspect your home, floors and carpets, and furniture. The black light will reveal any old stains so you can effectively clean and remove them. There are many effective pet stain/odor cleaning products available on the market.;
, Having your supplies on hand will make it easier for you to focus on house training your dog without needing to run to the store. Gather the following supplies:


Wire crate: Get a good quality wire crate that is large enough for your dog to stand up, lie down and turn around in. Position the crate in a quiet (but not isolated) part of your home.
Collar and leash
Chew toys and squeaky toys

, In order to get your dog house trained in 10 days, you need to follow a strict schedule of potty breaks, meals, play time, and crate confinement. If you can’t come home for certain parts of the day, then arrange a dog walker or pet sitter to visit your house to take care of the midday break.

, In order to house train your dog in 10 days, you need to strictly follow a schedule. This will establish a routine for both you and your dog. Your dog needs to go out first thing in the morning, after meals and play times, and before bedtime. Every moment should be accounted for. This is a sample schedule for someone who is home all day:


7:00 a.m.: Wake up and take dog outside.
7:10-7:30 a.m.: Free time in kitchen
7:30 a.m.: Food and water
8:00 a.m.: Go out
8:15 a.m.: Free time in kitchen
8:45 a.m.: Crate confinement
12:00 p.m.: Food and water
12:30 p.m.: Go out
12:45 p.m.: Free time in kitchen
1:15 p.m.: Crate confinement
5:00 p.m.: Food and water
5:30 p.m.: Go out
6:15 p.m.: Crate confinement
8:00 p.m.: Water
8:15 p.m.: Go out
8:30 p.m.: Free time in kitchen
9:00 p.m.: Crate confinement
11:00 p.m.: Go out and crate confinement overnight

, Select a place in your backyard that is suitable for your dog’s toileting. The base of a tree or a green patch of grass is ideal. Use this spot every time you take your dog to the potty.


At a scheduled potty time, or when you recognize your dog’s cues for needing to relieve himself, take him outside to this spot.
Use consistent language to refer to this place. For example, when your dog reaches this spot, say, “Go potty,” or use a similar verbal cue. Then your dog will associate this spot with toileting.
Be sure to follow your city’s ordinances with regards to pet waste removal. If you are in a city and don’t have a good green space for your dog to toilet, make sure you have plastic bags to pick up the waste.
If you live in a small space, such as a high rise apartment, you might need to use a dog litter tray in your apartment. This will give your dog a place to go inside.

, Your dog will stay in his crate for a few hours during the day, as well as overnight. Dogs like to have a small “den” to sleep in. A crate is a good place for the dog to feel safe.Make the crate comfortable, with a blanket, chew toys and squeaky toys.


Don’t use the crate as a punishment. Otherwise, your dog will associate this place with fear or anxiety rather than safety and comfort.

, Pay close attention to your dog so that you learn when he has to go. This might include the dog walking around stiffly or in circles, sniffing the floor like he’s searching for somewhere to pee, or letting his tail rest in a strange position.


If your dog looks like he needs to relieve himself, take him out to his designated spot right away. Do this even if you’re not at your scheduled potty break., Write down your dog’s eating schedule and bathroom habits. Note when your dog urinates and defecates. Note the exact time your dog eats and any other treats it is given during the day. Your journal will help you determine how long after eating and drinking your dog typically needs to relieve himself. You can use this information to adjust your schedule if necessary.

, You need to keep a vigilant eye on your dog whenever he is out of his crate. Even if he’s in the kitchen during his free time, you still need to watch him. This will ensure that you catch him before he has an accident. It’s imperative during this time that your dog associates toileting with going outside.You might consider tethering your dog to your waist with a leash when he is out of his crate. This way, you will be sure to keep him very close to you. You can track his movements more closely.

, If your dog has an accident in the house, clean it up as soon as possible. You don’t want your dog associating relieving himself with being inside the house.


Don’t use an ammonia-based cleaner. Urine has ammonia in it, so your dog might associate the cleaner’s smell with urinating. Instead, use an enzymatic cleaner on soiled areas.Don’t punish your dog for having an accident indoors.

, When your dog has relieved himself outdoors, give him lots of attention and pats. Say, “Good dog!” and other praise. Have a little celebration with your dog. This lets your dog know that its behavior is remarkable and deserves praise., When your dog has finished relieving himself, give him praise right away. You want to be sure that he associates the praise with the action that he just did. Otherwise, he might get confused about what he’s being praised for.

, Don’t use a harsh tone with your dog while you’re house training him. You don’t want him to feel scared or anxious about going outside or relieving himself.


Don’t yell at your dog if he has an accident indoors.

, Your dog is learning how to follow your instructions. Be patient with him. Don’t rub his face in his waste.Don’t yell or shout at your dog. Don’t hit your dog. If you’re not patient and friendly, your dog may associate fear and punishment with toileting.


If you catch your dog in the middle of an accident, make a loud noise or clap to startle him. Then he will stop urinating or defecating, and you can take him outside to finish up.

Select a crate for your cocker spaniel.,
Make the crate comfortable for your dog.,
Feed your dog his meals in his crate.,
Crate your dog for up to 30 minutes.,
Crate your dog when you leave home.",How to Train a Cocker Spaniel1," An important aspect of training your cocker spaniel is crate training. When done properly, your dog will see his crate as a place of refuge and relaxation, rather than a place of punishment.Crates, which are available at your local pet store, come in different sizes and materials , such as plastic, fabric, and metal.If your dog is a puppy, consider renting a crate from your local animal shelter, since he will eventually outgrow it. This will keep you from having to purchase new crates as he continues to grow.Your dog should be able to fit comfortably inside the crate, with enough room to stand up and turn around.Take your dog with you when you look at crates so that you will know what size and type will work for him.;
, The more inviting the crate looks to your dog, the more likely he will want to spend time inside of it. Position the crate in a common area in your house, such as the family room, and place comfortable bedding inside of it. You can also play some of his toys in the crate, along with some treats.Taking the door off of the crate will help it look more inviting to your dog.It may take your dog a few days to become comfortable with the crate.Be patient with him and do not force him to be comfortable with it by a certain time point.

, When it is time to feed your cocker spaniel, place his food bowl in the crate. Place the food bowl near the back of the crate so that he will need to walk completely into the crate to eat.If he is not comfortable with walking all the way to the back, move his food bowl closer to the front of the crate where he will be more comfortable.As he becomes more comfortable, you can slide the food bowl further and further back inside the crate.Eventually, he should be able to walk all the way into the crate to eat his meals.
When he is fully inside the crate to eat, close the crate’s door. Initially, leave it closed only for the amount of time that it takes him to eat. As his comfort level increases, leave the door closed for up to about 10 minutes after he has finished eating.If he whines to be let out during this process, wait until he stops whining to open the door. If you open the door while he is whining, he will learn that whining is a way to be let out of the crate., After your cocker spaniel is comfortable eating in his crate, he will need to learn how to be comfortable in his crate for longer periods of time (30 minutes or more). First, encourage him to go into his crate by pointing to his crate and saying “kennel.” When he goes inside, give him a treat as a reward and close the door. Stay near the crate for about 5 to 10 minutes, and then go to another room where he can’t see you for a few minutes. When you come back, stay near the crate again for a few minutes and then let him out.Remember not to let him out if he starts whining.
Reward him when you let him out to let him know that he did a good job.
Your dog may need up to several weeks to become comfortable with staying in his crate for 30 minutes, especially when he can’t see you., Before you leave your house, encourage your dog to enter his crate as before. When he is in his crate, reward with him a treat, close the crate door, and leave quietly. It is important not to prolong your departure or make it overly emotional. When you return home, stay calm when you approach his crate to let him out.The more calm that you are when you leave and return, the more likely your dog will remain calm as well. You do not want him to interpret your departure and arrival as anxiety-inducing events.Begin by leaving the house for short periods of time (20 to 30 minutes). As your dog becomes more comfortable with being left alone in the crate, you can try leaving home for longer periods of time.
Continue to crate him while you are at home so that he does not automatically associate crate time with being left alone."

Understand the importance of a schedule.Your puppy needs to be on a schedule that you control.,
Establish an eating routine.Most puppies should get four meals per day until they are 12 weeks old.,
Set up a bathroom schedule.Let the puppy outside to use the bathroom after every meal, play session, and nap or night's sleep.,
Get your puppy on a regular sleep schedule.This includes a regular bedtime that comes right after a bathroom break.,
Create a play schedule for your puppy.Play-time is an important part of your puppy's development.,
Buy a crate for your dog.,
Get your puppy used to the crate.Place the crate in a busy room in the house, where people gather often.,
Assign a regular bathroom spot.Take him to that same spot every time you take him out.,
Limit the puppy's outdoor time.,
Encourage your puppy to use the bathroom on command.Choose a specific word or phrase to serve command him to use the bathroom.,
Crate the puppy if he doesn't potty on command.,
Incorporate the bell into potty training.,
Teach your puppy to associate the bell with positive things.If your puppy seems scared by the bell sound, you need to make him comfortable with the sound before using the bell as part of potty training.,
Teach the puppy to ring the bell himself.When you are going outside on scheduled bathroom break, set him down next to the bell.,
Be consistent.,
Expand bell usage after the puppy has learned how to use it.",How to Potty Train Your Puppy Using a Bell," By regulating his feeding, sleeping, playing, and bathroom schedule, you help him fit comfortably into your life. The routine will bring him comfort, and you’ll have fewer “accidents” down the road.;
, After that, they should get 2-3 meals a day until they reach adulthood. Feed your puppy the amount recommended on the label. Many labels give only the total amount a dog should eat during the day. You’ll need to divide those amounts into portions throughout the day.


To ensure the puppy grows well, feed him in meals instead of leaving food out at all times. If he doesn't finish his food within 15 minutes, pick up and remove the rest.
Very small breeds often get low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). They should be fed four smaller meals spaced out to make sure their sugar levels are healthy throughout the day.

, He'll need a few weeks to adjust to the schedule, so expect accidents at first. But as the puppy grows up, he'll be able to go for longer periods between bathroom sessions.


Puppies 6-8 weeks old need to use the bathroom every hour during the day until they're housebroken. At night, you should let them out every 2-4 hours.
Puppies 8-16 weeks old should be able to hold it for about two hours during the day and four hours at night.

, Even when they're as young as eight weeks old, some puppies will sleep for a full eight hours during the night. Most, though, will need to use the bathroom at least once during the night. Do this 2-4 hours after putting your dog to bed.


It’s best to let the dog out every two hours the first night or two, just in case.
Begin increasing the time between wake-ups from every two hours to every four hours over several days or weeks. This will depend on the breed and how much your puppy sleeps. — Use your discretion.
Daytime napping is important for puppies, but if you let him nap all day, he won't sleep at night!

, During play, he'll learn that he's not allowed to bite or scratch, while working off his meals and growing strong and healthy. It also wears him out so he won't have excess energy that keeps him awake during scheduled nap or sleep times. A regular play schedule will keep him on his sleep schedule.


Training sessions should be fun enough for the puppy to count as play-time!
Keep your puppy safe while he plays. Help him avoid things like falling, getting stuck, or eating/chewing on things he shouldn’t.

, Crate training is the first step in potty training. Choose a crate with enough room for your dog to turn around comfortably. However, it shouldn't have so much room that he could use the bathroom in one corner and sleep in another. If your puppy learns to associate his crate with using the bathroom, he'll resist going into the crate to lay or sleep.


In the first few weeks, expect accidents in the crate even if it's the right size for the puppy. Don't lose your patience, though! He's still learning.
If your puppy is a larger breed, consider buying a crate with adjustable barriers that can be removed as the dog grows.

, The den or family room is a good location for crate training. Leave the crate door open so the puppy can explore it at his own pace, and treat him whenever he goes into the crate.


After he's grown used to the crate, start closing the door and leaving him in it for longer periods of time. Crate him at night and anytime you aren’t home or able to watch him.
You can move the crate between rooms, bringing it into the bedroom with you at night, for example. But always make sure it's somewhere your dog feels safe.

, If he associates going to the bathroom with a very specific place, he'll be less likely to have accidents in other places. It'll also make clean-up easier in the future because you'll know where he likes to go.

, Minimize how much time he plays outside during the first 2-4 weeks of potty training. Playing with the dog outside in the middle of his potty training will confuse him about what he should do when he goes outside. When he's mastered potty-training, you can start spending more playtime outside with him.

, ""Bathroom"" or ""Go potty"" are examples. When you take him outside, use that same phrase and the same tone of voice every time he goes to the bathroom. If your puppy uses the bathroom after you give the command, praise him with a lot of excitement and a treat.


You might also choose a separate command specific to encouraging your dog to defecate. Young puppies need to defecate more often, so teaching a dog to associate a specific command with defecating can be useful.

, This isn't a punishment, but a training tool. If your puppy doesn’t use the bathroom within a few minutes of you giving the command, put him in his crate for 5-10 minutes. The dog may whine or cry when confined to the crate, but don’t let them out.–It will confuse the learning process.


After 5-10 minutes have passed, take him back outside to use the bathroom and give the command again.
Repeat the process until he makes an attempt to use the bathroom after you give the command.
When he finally uses the bathroom, repeat the command and reward him with lots of praise and a treat, then let him back into the house to play.

, Hang the bell by the door you use each time you take the dog out. It should hang low enough for your puppy to reach with his paw or nose. Use the bell only with a single door at first. You can move the bell or add more bells at other doors once the puppy understands how the bell system works.


Very small breed dogs and very young puppies may not be able to hold it long enough to reach the door that leads outside. In that case, hang the bell wherever the dog spends the most time — the living room, for example. You can move the bell to the outside door when the puppy can hold it a little longer.
It helps to keep the dog’s living area small during the stage until potty training is well established. You might use a puppy gate and attach a bell to it.

, Hold out treats near the bell, and ring it when the dog comes to retrieve the treats. You might smear a little cheese or some other treat on the bell, and, when the dog touches the bell, reward him with an additional treat. Repeat this process until the dog knows to associate the bell with reward.

, Always open the door immediately after any hint of the bell ringing, and give lots of praise. There are a few different ways to train your puppy to ring the bell:


Without ringing the bell yourself, tap your fingers on the wall or door next to it, and say ""Outside."" Your puppy should learn to jump up to your fingers, ringing the bell in the process.
Hold a treat just behind the bell, and say ""Outside."" The puppy’s nose will ring the bell when he goes for the treat.
Physically take your puppy’s paw, hit the bell with it, and say ""Outside.""
Skip the bell training if you’re rushing out for a bathroom emergency. Only use the bell with scheduled bathroom breaks.

, Your puppy is very smart, and has a great sense of cause and effect. Anything he observes before the door opening/praise/treat will be seen as a cause of the desired effect. If you let variation creep into what your dog experiences before the door opens, he can become confused. Make it easy for him to learn what he needs to do to be let out. Keep it simple. For example, only use one of the methods outlined in the previous step — don't mix and match.

, You can either move the bell to different doors or hang a different bell by each exterior door. When you travel, take a bell with you so the dog can use it while on the road. Similarly, send the bell with your dog if he stays at another home while you’re away on a trip. If you need to find a new home for your dog, let the new owners know he's bell trained, and encourage them to make a bell available at the new home.

Remember that because bully breed dogs tend to be stout and muscular, collars and leashes made of strong, unbreakable materials are the best way to control your pet.Try a head collar like those made by Gentle Leader. These redistribute pressure so that your dog is not injured by pulling on the leash.
Many dog training experts advise against the use of choke, prong, or shock collars, as these may seriously injure your pet.;
, Clicker training is very successful with some dogs. The point of the clicker is to draw the dog's attention to the specific behavior it is engaging in that's being rewarded.It teaches dogs to expect a reward for good behavior until the dog eventually behaves on command without needing the reward.You can purchase a training clicker at many pet stores or through an online retailer.
Use the clicker immediately after your dog displays good behavior and follows your command. The goal is to make your timing precise so the dog knows what's being rewarded.
When you activate the clicker, you'll want to reward your dog almost simultaneously with a treat and verbal praise. The reward should come within three seconds of the position your dog holds on command.
Start out with simple commands, like ""watch me"" or ""sit,"" then progress to more advanced commands like ""leave it.""
Eventually your dog will come to understand it's being rewarded for acting on your command and it will begin to follow your commands whether you have a treat in your hand or not.

, Verbal commands are a good starting point for training your dog. ""Sit"" is a basic command that can help break an excited dog from its distraction. You can teach this and other verbal commands at home, or have your dog learn commands from a trainer in an obedience class.Hold a treat in front of and slightly above your dog's head.
Say your dog's name and the command ""sit"" while holding the treat above.
When your dog sits, give it a reward and offer verbal praise.

, Teaching the ""stay"" command is valuable for preventing undesirable behavior (say, to keep your dog from lunging at food that's fallen) as well as for protecting your dog (keeping it from running in the street or approaching an unfriendly dog, for example). Before your dog can learn to stay, it should already know and follow the ""sit"" command.Have your dog sit or lie down facing you.
Hold up your hand with your palm open and say ""stay"" or ""wait."" Wait a few seconds, but don't expect your dog to hold its excitement for too long.
Use a word or phrase that indicates your dog is released, such as ""okay"" or ""good stay,"" then give your dog the treat.
If your dog gets up before you've given the release, calmly return to where you were standing and go through the process with your dog again. As your dog learns, you can gradually increase the distance between you and your dog while it stays.

, Coming on command can be a lifesaver if your dog ever gets off leash or approaches another dog against your will. Start out just teaching your dog to recognize your command - either ""come,"" ""come here,"" or simply calling your dog by name.Squat down and open your arms wide while facing your dog.
If your dog begins to approach you, give verbal praise and encourage your dog to keep coming to you.
Use a happy and encouraging tone of voice as you call your dog. This will help reinforce that your dog is doing what you want by coming on command.
If your dog doesn't come to you, attach its leash to its collar and lead your dog to the spot where you were calling from. Be sure to praise your dog while you guide your dog to that spot to reinforce that this was what you wanted.
Once your dog gets good at coming on command you can add additional commands, like starting from a ""sit"" position.

, The ""heel"" command will help break your dog of undesirable behavior on walks, such as weaving around/between your legs or pulling at the end of its leash. You don't necessarily need to use the word ""heel""; you can also say ""let's go,"" ""forward,"" or whatever command you prefer. The key is to choose one command and use it consistently so your dog always knows what you expect.Stand next to your dog with its leash in your left hand and a squeaky toy your dog likes in your right hand. Be sure your dog is on your left side and waiting in a seated position.
Extend the squeaky toy across the front of your body so that it's hovering above and slightly in front of your dog's face. Try to get your dog's attention with the toy, then give your verbal command and step forward confidently.
Try to hold your dog's attention with the toy. Any time your dog gets distracted, you'll squeeze the toy to regain your dog's attention and give it verbal praise when it re-focuses or looks up at you.
After about 20 to 30 seconds of focus and well-behaved walking, praise your dog and give it the toy to play with. You can gradually increase the walk time as your dog progresses in its training.

, Training and verbal commands are highly effective at breaking bad behavior, but like teaching anything else they require consistency and patience. Make sure you train your dog the right way from the start so that your pet understands what's expected and learns to follow your command no matter what else is happening in your environment.Don't just give commands while sitting or squatting. Try standing or getting into other positions so your dog learns to respond to all types of body language and posture.
Make sure your hands are visible. If you put your hands in your pockets, your dog will anticipate a treat and will respond to the reward instead of the verbal cue.
Relying too heavily on treats in general will affect your dog's training. If you constantly have a whole bag of treats in your hand, your dog will learn that you only need to be obeyed when the treats are out.
Move your training to other rooms of the house and even outdoors. This will help teach your dog that you expect obedience in all places, not just in the living room.

, Obedience training will help your dog learn basic training and will also socialize your dog. Classes can even help you and your dog bond since you'll typically be involved in the in-class training. You can choose to start with a basic introductory class, or find something that better suits your dog's needs.


Obedience classes can help address specific behavioral issues like aggression, antisocial behavior, and refusal to obey.
Some dog trainers offer obedience classes specifically tailored towards bully breeds. These classes deal with basic training and address behavioral issues common to bully breeds.You can find obedience classes through local animal trainers. Search online to find a trainer near you or ask your veterinarian for recommendations on a good local trainer.

, It's a good idea to be well bonded with your dog before you introduce it to other people or animals outside the home. Once your dog has bonded with you, it will likely be much more calm and trusting around other people and dogs.Spend time every day playing with your dog one-on-one. You can play catch or simply take your dog for long walks.
If your dog is receptive to it, you can try spending some cuddle time together. This may help your dog get comfortable with physical contact and intimacy.

, Socialization is an important part of raising a well-behaved, well-adjusted dog, and bully breeds are no exception. Socialization can help your dog learn to play with other dogs without getting aggressive and get used to being around other people.Dogs should have some socialization with other dogs and people well before reaching 16 weeks of age. This can help acclimate your dog to being around other animals.
Be sure to socialize your dog with a variety of other people so that it becomes used to different faces and body types. This includes men and women of varying ages and races, men with facial hair, and people wearing coats and scarves (if you live in a cold climate)., Playtime is a great way for dogs to socialize with one another, but it's important to limit play time and supervise the dogs at all times. You can also use playtime as an opportunity to teach or reinforce training commands.Start out having your dog play with a mellow, well-behaved dog to make the socialization playtime go more smoothly. Choose a dog that is roughly equal in size and energy level.
Break up play time with commands every few minutes. These command intermissions should last roughly 30 to 60 seconds before playtime resumes.
Have four or five command intermissions four or five times during each playtime session, then separate the dogs at the end and reward them with treats.
If possible, schedule play sessions every day (but not more than once each day) with the same dog. Do this for a few consecutive weeks, gradually increasing the command intermissions each time until you reach about 90 seconds of intermission time.

, Dogs that live indoors tend to be calmer and more well-adjusted than dogs forced to live outside. Living inside a home with you and your family will help your dog develop a healthy state of mind. It reinforces your dog's sense of family and its feelings of security., If you're worried about your bully breed acting out towards another dog, you'll need to know what to look for. Though every dog is unique and behavior may vary slightly from one dog to another, there are some common signs of aggression to watch out for.These include, but are not limited to:


staring at another dog
ears turned forward
tail rigid and erect over the dog's back
barking/growling
hair on neck and back standing up
crouching or pouncing motions

, Feeding time is when many dogs become aggressive or protective. If your dog sees food as a resource to be competed over, it may become aggressive if you feed your dog with another dog in the room or vice versa.Whether you have other dogs or are socializing your bully breed with other dogs, it's best to feed your dog separately from any other dogs.
Even dogs that seem well-behaved may have problems sharing a food bowl or seeing another dog eating food.

, Many dog owners encourage their dogs to romp and wrestle with other dogs. However, competition can quickly escalate, and bully breeds may be particularly susceptible to that risk. For this reason, it's best to avoid having your dog compete with any other dog for any reason.Toys and treats are two of the biggest things dogs will commonly compete over. These are both highly-desired resources for dogs, and even playful competition could get out of hand.
If your dog starts play wrestling with another dog, supervise them closely. Even well-paired dogs may get out of hand if they feel the need to compete, and you may have to intervene quickly.

, Though you may not think of altering your dog as a training component, experts generally agree that having your dog spayed or neutered will improve its behavior. That's because an unaltered dog, whether male or female, is more likely to roam away from home and exhibit hostile behavior than a dog that's been spayed or neutered.Most veterinarians are capable of performing a spaying or neutering procedure. Ask your vet about how altering your dog can improve its behavior and its overall demeanor.

, Getting into a fight with another dog can leave a significant impression on your dog. This could result in fearful or aggressive behavior towards other dogs in the future. Close supervision and careful selection of dog playmates can help prevent fighting. Keep all dogs on their leashes until you know how they'll react towards one another.Be prepared to intervene anytime your dog does play with other dogs. If things look like they're about to get rough, you'll need to step in before the situation becomes hostile.
Never, under any circumstances, should you ever reach in with your hands to break up a fight. You should also never grab a dog by its tail, as this will cause it to turn and bite you.Step on the aggressor's feet to distract it.
Use a large push broom to break up the fight. Put the bristled end of the broom against the aggressor's chest and force it away from the other dog.
Use an unpleasant sound, such as a loud whistle, to distract the dogs. You can also throw water on the dogs to distract them from their aggression towards one another.

Learn about dog training.,
Learn about the Boxer breed.,
Talk to other Boxer owners and trainers.",How to Train a Boxer Dog1," Educate yourself so you can teach your dog properly and avoid common training mistakes. The basic process of dog training is to reward behavior that you like and to make sure that behavior you don't like isn't rewarded.Each dog is unique, however, so learning the basics of dog behavior and basic dog training will provide you with the proper foundation for understanding the process of training your pet. No one method is “perfect,” so your research will help you decide which approach to use.


There are methods of dog training based on only positive training techniques, versus techniques that balance positive and negative reinforcement. You may try a method and find that you are not getting the results and decide want and decide to try another. An experienced dog trainer will be able to help you troubleshoot roadblocks.
Read dog training books and watch videos of training techniques. There are a lot of dog training videos on the internet and lots of dog training books in print, so make sure that the videos and books you choose are from experts in dog training.;
, Boxers are descended from hunting companion dogs, so they are active dogs that like a lot of time to jump, leap, and bound about.These dogs need exercise and stimulation every day or they might get bored, so stimulation is key to keeping them happy and obedient.


You will need to keep your dog's temperament in mind when training them. You can't expect the same kind of behavior from every dog. When training a Boxer, you need to keep their high energy level and intelligence in mind.

, Go to dog shows and watch how owners and trainers interact with their dogs. In addition, pay attention to how Boxers respond to stimuli and commands.


Visit dog trainers and ask if you can watch a few classes. You will learn a lot watching other people when you don’t have a dog of your own.
See if you like the way the trainer works with the people and the dogs. You and your dog will learn better if you have a good learning relationship with your trainer. The Association of Professional Dog Trainers website is an excellent reference and place to start looking for a dog trainer to coach you and your pup.

Begin training early.,
Focus on rewards-based training.,
Use food rewards.,
Start with basic commands.,
Mix up the reward-giving.,
Expand the training.,
Enroll your puppy in an accredited obedience program.",How to Train a Boxer Puppy1," Boxer dogs are highly energetic but also intelligent animals. They will learn through through repetition, so it's important you begin issuing clear commands and cues early on, even when they're puppies.For young puppies (8 to12 weeks old), keep training sessions short but fun. For example, when you bring your new puppy home, take him to the toilet spot in the garden and praise him when he uses it. It will be a coincidence at first, but it's never too young to tell him ""Toilet time"" when he happens to squat. Then lavish lots of praise on him.This will help your dog learn to connect that behavior with praise from the get-go and make him more likely to repeat it.You can also start with simple commands such as ""Sit"". With a young pup, the training is a simple as spotting he's about to sit anyway, and when his hind leg hits the ground, saying ""Sit"" and making a bit of a fuss of him. He'll be perplexed at first, but soon he'll realize the link between the word and the action.;
, This method works by rewarding good behavior, while ignoring the bad. This capitalizes on the idea of using what motivates a Boxer puppy to train him: rewards of food and attention/affection. The idea is that the Boxer works hard to repeat the behavior which earned him a treat or a fuss. The unwanted behavior was ignored by you, the trainer, and in your dog's mind does not benefit him at all, is a waste of energy, and therefore is not worth repeating. Because Boxers like food and attention, this is best way to train them.Punishment is not a part of this training technique. Never beat your dog. Beating or hitting dogs when they behave undesirably is not a useful training measure. Instead of learning from the punishment, your dog will instead become fearful of you, which ultimately defeats the training process since that is not the desired result.
In the end, rewarding good behavior is more useful and constructive for training purposes than punishing bad behavior.

, Appeal to your Boxer puppy's belly. Boxers are very food-oriented and motivated. Reward desirable behavior with food and you’re likely to get a repeat of that good behavior. Food treats should be small, such as Mini Zukes, Charlie Bears, Bil Jac or freeze dried liver. Many dogs will even work for their regular dog kibble.


Think about the giving of treats as a reward for the behavior you wish to encourage only as a starting measure. Treats should soon be replaced with praise as the reward, otherwise the dog may become overweight or even obese.Alternatively, you could also weigh out your dog's daily food allowance out and then set aside a small amount of the daily total for use as treats. This helps prevent your Boxer from putting on weight with all the training you are doing., Aim to give a command, and then give a reward immediately the action is carried out. This strengthens the link in the dog's mind between action and reward. Start with a basic command, such as ""Sit,"" and work on that until your dog has it mastered.Grab a treat and let the puppy sniff the treat in your hand so he knows it's there. Then hold the treat just above the pup's eye level, over the head, so he has to look up to keep it in view. Once he is looking for the treat, draw an arc over her head so that when he looks up to follow, his bottom naturally sinks down. As soon as he starts sitting, say give the command ""Sit"" and give the treat.
Work up to other commands or tricks, such as ""Lie down"" and ""Paw"" (where he extends his paw to you. Rewards-based training is the best method to get your dog to understand and follow all kinds of commands and cues.

, Once your dog is regularly repeating an action after he is issued a command, make the treat giving less predictable. Mix things up a little. Typically, a dog that gets a reward every time gets sloppy because the treats are too easy to come by. By skipping a reward, it sharpens up your dog's thinking and makes him wonder if he didn't sit fast enough or well enough. He will therefore work harder to please you. Eventually you will reward every fourth or fifth command, so that he remains focused on earning a treat but without getting discouraged that they are too hard to earn., Test your Boxer pup in different situations and add distractions. Once you have established basic commands (e.g. ""Sit"" and ""Stay"") in the quiet of your own yard, practice with distractions so the dog knows he must respond and learns to focus on you no matter what the distractions. Add noise, or another trainer, or even another animal. When you dog gets distracted and has troubling focusing, you need to temporarily interrupt his stream of thought by talking to or commanding him or by an action (such as stomping your foot).Develop distraction techniques with treats in low distraction settings and at home. Always follow through with praise and treats. As you get more confident on your dog's ability to stay in control, increase the level of difficulty by walking around the block or near a dog park to work on his skills. Work up to busier areas once your puppy is consistently responding to commands like “leave it” or “watch me”.
Work up slowly to added distraction and you will both gain confidence in your dog's ability to handle a crowd. This is key to creating a well-mannered dog that behaves well in situations where there are other people and animals.

, Local shelters, pet stores, and other organizations offer training programs at low cost. Consider visiting one of the classes prior to enrolling to make sure that you agree with the type of training presented. You may also want to consider getting a professional trainer. A professional dog trainer, such as one from the Association of Professional Dog Trainers (APDT), is very knowledgeable about dogs and can help you learn basic handling skills. Overall, though it is an added expense, having professional training assistance is beneficial in the long run because it will help you and your energetic dog communicate effectively.An important part of training is helping your Boxer to behave around other dogs, so try and attend a puppy class. Many veterinary clinics hold puppy classes, which are ideal for Boxers who need early socialization. All the attendees have received their first vaccination and are only allowed to attend if they are healthy. The benefit to the puppy is learning confidence and social skills around other young dogs."

Enroll your German Shepherd puppy in a basic or puppy obedience class.",How to Train a German Shepherd1," Although any German Shepherd dog is trainable, they are very strong and powerful animals. If you start out with a puppy, you have the opportunity to shape and mold its personality and develop your relationship early.


If you happen to get an older dog, adult dogs can still be trained effectively.
German Shepherds can be very protective of their family members, so you want to socialize your puppy early in puppyhood. This will get them used to interacting well with a wide variety of people and animals, which is essential.;
, This will be a big dog, and you want to prepare the dog when they are young and small for future grooming and veterinary visits. They may need nail trimming, ear cleaning, temperature taking and other procedures. These procedures will be difficult to accomplish should your full-sized adult German Shepherd dog object.

, You will need to train them to sit, stay, and heel, in addition to house training them. Your puppy will not understand your commands immediately. Have patience with your dog when they don't do exactly what you ask right away.

, German Shepherds love to learn and they are highly motivated to follow your commands if they are rewarded with treats.

, Pet your puppy while they're eating, as long as they do not stiffen and stop eating when you are petting the puppy. If the puppy stiffens, stops eating or growls, you have to deal with this aggressive response immediately.


Teach your puppy that people are not a threat to the food bowl by adding food to the bowl while they are eating. Start with a few kibbles (or whatever type of food you normally feed) in the bowl and add food so the puppy associates good things with people near the food bowl.

, Do this by removing the food bowl and feeding the dog by hand.The puppy needs to earn each and every piece of food from you with a “sit” or some other command. There is no bowl to guard.


Once the puppy is more confident and compliant around food, you can bring out a plate or bowl and continue your hand feeding routine in the presence of the bowl or plate, but don’t feed directly on the plate yet.
Make the bowl no big deal. If a piece of food is dropped inside, let the puppy take it and praise them. Then feed nearby again. The bowl will not always have food inside. Gradually increase the amount of food you drop in the bowl as you stand or sit there with the puppy. It won’t take long before the puppy realizes that you near the bowl means food and good things and it is not something to guard.
You can also add high value treats like roasted chicken breast into the bowl if your puppy seems to need more reassurance that you bring goodness to the food bowl.
If, at any time, you feel that you are in danger. STOP. Get a professional trainer involved immediately to prevent harm to yourself or another family member, particularly a child. Resource guarding can be a very serious symptom of fear aggression and, if you are seeing this in a puppy, it needs to be addressed ASAP so it does not escalate.

, You can gradually ask the puppy to look at you to get more food, then sit and wait for more food, etc.. The humans controls the resource of food and rewards the puppy for good behavior.

, After your puppy has mastered a command, start treating intermittently so that you don’t have a dog that will only perform for food. You still praise your dog, just not offer a treat each time. If you are working to modify a command to create a faster response, add in treats again to shape the behavior until they have it down. Then start using treats to reward truly outstanding performance.

, Do not yell at your pet. Learn to recognize when you are losing patience and stop the training session on a happy note. Your dog can sense your frustration in your body language and tone of voice. Try another day when you are both fresh.


If you continue to have problems, get a professional trainer involved.

, Typically, as puppies are first learning commands, one adult family member will be responsible for training. Later, when the puppy is consistent and understands the basics, other members of the family can participate in formal training. It is important for the dog to understand that not only one person in the household is to be obeyed.


Your puppy should be 8-10 weeks old and started on their vaccine series for this first class. There are puppy preschools designed for puppies who have not yet finished receiving all of their vaccines. The school will have certain requirements for enrollment and you will likely have to provide proof of vaccination.

Establish yourself as the “alpha.” Siberian Huskies are notorious for being difficult to train.,
Reward good behavior.,
Discipline your husky without using violence.,
Build a useful vocabulary with your husky.,
Be consistent and balanced in your training.,
Make some rules and try to stick with them.,
Exercise at least thirty minutes a day to burn off excess energy in addition to play time.",How to Train a Siberian Husky1," They are a pack dog with a hierarchical order of leadership and, therefore, are stubborn, strong-willed, and independent. Because huskies have natural behavioral traits that can be destructive if not properly trained, it is important to get an early start on minimizing bad behavior in order to establish a foundation for a well-behaved dog. It is important to have knowledge of a Siberian Husky’s temperament. Confidence and a strong-will are important qualities to have as an owner in order to establish obedience in your dog. Huskies will only respect or listen to commands coming from an “alpha.”
Treating your husky as an equal is not a good idea because huskies are hierarchical pack dogs and only follow leaders. You must demonstrate yourself as the leader at all times, whether that is eating first, entering doorways before your dog, or making your husky move out of your way, it is important to establish this tiered relationship.
Sometimes huskies become aggressive in an attempt to establish a pecking order of leadership by biting, posturing, or engaging in other violent behaviors. In this case, demonstrating your dominance as the “alpha” is imperative to curbing this behavior. Permitting your husky to continue this behavior or not addressing will only encourage stronger aggression towards other people and dogs.
Siberian Huskies sometimes engage in behavior that is very natural for them but unwanted by people. The alpha position will also provide you the authority to train your husky not to engage in bad behavior such as jumping, digging, biting, and chewing. A Husky will only obey the alpha.;
, Good manners are the foundation for a well-behaved dog. Providing tasty treats and using an encouraging voice is an effective combination for your husky to repeat good behavior. This is called “positive reinforcement” or “respect training.” Make sure to quickly dish out rewards so that your husky understands which behavior to replicate. Waiting too long will only confuse your husky. Once your husky masters a command, the treat will no longer be needed.
Redirect bad behavior into good behavior. Focus the dog’s attention away from being naughty towards a good behavioral act. This shows a dog what can and cannot be done without discipline.
The lure and reward system is safe because huskies will not become fearful, aggressive, or stressed from abuse. Instead, of performing violence on your husky, you are simply withholding treats that your husky failed to earn.
Keep training simple and set goals. Your husky, like any other animal, has a learning curve. Start out easy with minimal commands and build up to more complex ones and reward at all stages.

, Along with praise and rewards, huskies must also receive discipline for bad behavior. As with praise, corrective measures must be taken immediately, be consistent, and redirected towards performing good behavior. In order not to go overboard with physical or abusive disciple and losing your husky’s willingness to obey, control your husky’s resources, such as treats, toys, play, and affection until the dog responds with corrective behavior. Be firm in your discipline. Use words like “no” or “stop” with strong assertion but without anger in your voice.
At all times, make sure you are exhibiting alpha leadership by firmly controlling the training and by giving commands authoritatively.
A given command must be obeyed. If your husky refuses, then walk away and ignore him without giving him what he wants. After a few minutes, give the command again – be persistent and patient until he obeys.
If your husky continues to be stubborn and refuses to obey after several attempts, remove him to a “time-out” designated area where he cannot interact with people until he settles down.

, Just like communicating with another human, useful vocabulary is the basis for comprehension and a good relationship with your husky. A strong vocabulary will make your husky smart, well-mannered, and most importantly, get your husky to understand what you want done. Simple words like yes, no, sit, stay, come, or short phrases are best when trying to communicate with your husky.
Familiar words and phrases build trust – a husky builds confidence knowing who their leader is and what is expected of them.
A good vocabulary provides your husky with knowledge and, eventually, the ability to piece together words and phrases to complete complex tasks.

, Although huskies are known to be intelligent, good behavior is a response to repeated conditioning in a consistent environment. Setting a routine is the best way to accomplishing consistency. Routines are good for both dog and owner because a regular schedule of training, playing, potty, and exercise maximizes time together and relaxes expectations. Commitment to a daily routine is the biggest hurdle to effectively training your husky. Be aware that sudden changes in a schedule can irritate and confuse a dog, making him more vulnerable to break the rules you established during training.
Make sure supplies, such as food, toys, collar, leash, treats, and cleaning materials are readily available so that the daily schedule is not interrupted or place stress on either the owner or the dog.
Always remain calm and plan for success. Siberian Huskies must realize who is in charge and that commands are to be followed and are not merely suggestions. Make sure that rewards and discipline are equal to the achievement or infraction. Love and tenderness are always good qualities to share with your best friend.

, Although huskies are known to be intelligent, good behavior is a response to repeated conditioning in a consistent environment. Therefore, it is important to make rules and stick with them and to communicate these rules to all family members who come into contact with your husky. Most likely, a husky will not follow commands that are inconsistent or confusing.


Decide what rooms the dog can access, which furniture will or will not be available for your husky to lounge on, and where sleeping quarters will be.
There will be times when you have to leave your husky alone. In this case, make sure boundaries are established to protect your property from an overzealous or bored husky. Consider a place like the kitchen where it will be easy to clean up accidents, low-risk for destructive behavior, and close to family activity to prevent loneliness.

, Remember that Siberian Huskies have been trained for hundreds, if not thousands, of years to be sled dogs, which has built up their endurance level. A lack of exercise will do more than make your husky fat and lazy, it will provide motive for mischievous behavior such as escaping, howling, chewing, crying, and digging. “Walking your dog” is not good enough for a Siberian Husky. They were bred to run for several miles a day and, therefore, require large amounts of exercise. At the very minimum, you should be prepared for a good run every day or at least a brisk walk to tire your husky.
Siberian Huskies prefer to howl than to bark. Excessive howling troubles neighbors and brings complaints. Exercising will release their pent up energy and minimize excessive howling.
Siberian Huskies have a reputation as “escape artists.” Huskies are creative when it comes to finding a way to leave the yard. In most cases, your husky will only attempt to “escape” if under-exercised or bored.
Other outdoor activities such as bikejoring, hiking, or even a game of fetch, flyball, or Frisbee will help tire your husky and provide solid alternatives to running.

Choose an outdoor spot for your dog to go to the bathroom.,
Give him the “potty” command.,
Do not punish him if he goes to the bathroom inside.,
Recognize when your dog needs to go the bathroom.,
Feed your dog and take him out on a regular schedule.",How to Train a Cocker Spaniel2," Potty training can actually go hand-in-hand with crate training, since your dog will not want to relieve himself in the area where he stays inside the house. When you take him outside on the leash, give him some freedom to choose the area where he wants to go. Keep in mind that he may choose somewhere other than grass, such as soil or mulch.Guide him away from areas that would not be appropriate, such as your neighbor’s yard or your plants.
If you have your own fenced-in backyard, it may not be necessary to take him out on the leash to select a spot. He will know that the backyard is where he is supposed to go to the bathroom.
Whichever spot he chooses, take him to this spot each time that you take him outside on the leash to go to the bathroom.

, When you are at the designated bathroom spot, say “potty” and wait for him to go. This may take several minutes, since he may not understand this verbal command right away. After he goes to the bathroom, reward him with a treat.If he does not go to the bathroom after several minutes, take him back inside and wait for about 15 minutes. If you had him on a leash, keep his leash on him during this 15-minute wait period. Then, take him back outside again to the same spot. Repeat this until he goes to the bathroom outside. Once he goes, reward him with a treat.Make sure that he does not go to the bathroom inside during the wait period.This may be more likely to happen if your cocker spaniel is a puppy.
It may take a lot of repetition before your dog knows that he should go to the bathroom in the same spot outside.

, Cocker spaniels are very sensitive to punishment,so do not verbally or physically punish him if he goes to the bathroom inside. If you see him in the act of going to the bathroom inside, try to interrupt him and get his attention by clapping loudly with your hands. Take him outside to the designated bathroom spot as quickly as possible, either by picking him up and carrying him or walking him on the leash.When you get back inside, clean up the mess without punishing him.Your cocker spaniel may relieve himself inside because of a medical issue, such as kidney disease. If he is consistently going to the bathroom inside your house despite potty training, take him to your veterinarian so that he can be examined for underlying medical conditions.

, More than likely, your cocker spaniel will let you know when he needs to relieve himself. When he is inside, he may start whining or whimpering to let you know that he needs to go outside. Take him out as soon as you can if he starts doing this. If you are outside on a walk, he may start circling or sniffing places to find the perfect spot to go.If you are out on a long walk, keep in mind that it may not be practical to make it back to his regular bathroom spot in time. If this is the case, allow him to go the bathroom where you are and pick up his waste if necessary.

, Feeding him on a regular schedule will likely lead to him needing to go to the bathroom at around the same time each day. Cocker spaniels have small bladders, so you may need to take him out several times a day (about every four to five hours) so that he can relieve himself. If your schedule does not allow for you to take your dog out this frequently, consider having a dog walker take your dog out when you are not home."
"
Choose a leash and collar for your dog.,
Familiarize your cocker spaniel with his collar.,
Get your cocker spaniel comfortable with his leash.,
Walk with your dog on the leash.",How to Train a Cocker Spaniel3," If you have not already selected a leash and collar your cocker spaniel, you can purchase them at your local pet store. The leash should be either four or six feet in length. A regular snap or buckle collar will be suitable. Body harnesses, choke collars, and pinch collars are not suitable for training your cocker spaniel to walk on a leash.Make sure that the leash is non-retractable. Retractable leashes can actually encourage your dog to pull and not walk beside you.

, This is important if your cocker spaniel is a puppy and is not used to having anything on his neck. This step will probably not be necessary for an adult cocker spaniel. Place the collar around your puppy’s neck when he is distracted by something else, such as eating or playing. Keep the collar on him even if he tries to take it off. If you take it off when he tries to take it off himself, you will actually be encouraging him to get his collar off.Remove the collar when he is distracted by eating or playing. If you are also crate training your puppy, remove the collar before you put him back in his crate., Your dog may not be immediately comfortable with his leash being attached to his collar, especially if he’s a puppy. If this is the case, start with attaching something small to his collar, such as a piece of string or a shoelace. Just like with the collar, attach and remove the leash (or other small object) when your puppy is distracted with something else.Whether your cocker spaniel is a puppy or an adult, do not leave him unattended when you have attached the leash. The leash could get caught on something, which could potentially cause serious injury to your dog., The goal is to walk your dog on the leash without him pulling. If he goes ahead of you and starts to pull on the leash, immediately stop walking (‘red light’). When your dog realizes that you have stopped, he will likely turn around and start walking back towards you. Once he has reached your side again, command him to sit. Once he is sitting, reward him with a treat and begin walking again (‘green light’).Continue walking with your dog. If he pulls again, practice the ‘red light’ and ‘green light’ actions. It will probably take several walking sessions before your cocker spaniel learns not to pull on the leash. Provide him with treats each time that he walks beside you and does not pull.Do not reward him if he pulls to sniff something or go to the bathroom.Make sure to keep the leash loose while you are walking with your dog, even when he is walking right beside you. Your dog’s natural instinct will be to pull if you are holding the leash too tightly.Avoid pulling on the leash yourself to guide him to where you want him to go."
"
Use food and praise as motivators.,
Give your dog chew toys to avoid naughty chewing.,
Spend short bursts of time training your puppy.This means only about five to 10 minutes at a time.,
Keep training positive.,
Begin potty training your Boxer puppy.",How to Train a Boxer Dog2," Food is a powerful motivator for most dogs. Praise, in addition to a reward that is valuable to your dog, can be used to communicate to your dog that they have performed well.


The timing of the reward is extremely important. Your praise and reward will need to come within two to three seconds of the behavior you are reinforcing. If the dog does something else in between the desired behavior and the reward, you are rewarding the last thing that the dog performed.
Treats should be small and tasty. Consider three types: Low-, medium- and high-value treats. Keep these in your arsenal to help your dog learn commands.

, This includes rawhide bones as well as soft toys. By alternating toys you give your dog different textures to experience and hopefully keep your household items and trash safe from being chewed on or ingested.


You can also use toys as a motivator for other kinds of training. Dogs with a high prey drive respond well to toys as a reward.

, Multiple shorter training session are generally more effective than one long one, particularly for puppies under six months of age. Their attention span is short and puppies get tired; your patience will be worn thin trying to train an over tired puppy.

, Training has to be upbeat and happy in order to get the maximum response from the dog. Play with the puppy in between and help them understand that people are fun and not all about “school” all the time.

, Potty training a puppy requires a consistent bathroom schedule. Praise your puppy every time they go to the bathroom outside.


If there is a potty accident in the house and you catch the puppy in the act, let them know that it's not good behavior by saying ""no."" Then take your pup outside until they potty.
Take the puppy out every 20 to 30 minutes to increase the chance of their going outside. Then reward this behavior with a treat. The ideal situation is to take the puppy out after every nap; however, no matter how much you take them outside, your pup will probably still have messes inside the house.
Keep your dog close to you during the months of potty training. Do not let the dog have run of the house because if you are not paying attention, your dog can sneak off and do their bathroom business without you noticing.

Begin with dog training basics.,
Train your Boxer to avoid breed-specific problems.,
Consider crate training your Boxer.",How to Train a Boxer Dog3," Training should really start from day one when the Boxer is still a puppy. If possible, don't wait until the dog is adult to start training or they will already have bad habits. With that in mind, Boxers are not necessarily any different than other dogs when it comes to basic training. If your dog does not know simple commands, such as sit and heel, then start with those. It is important to begin training by building trust between you and your dog. Keep training sessions happy and short and give the dog a break in between lessons for play and a drink.


For example, rid your dog of barking issues by training them when to speak and when to be silent. You can do this by praising them for barking, reinforcing the word ""speak,"" and giving the animal a treat. Later when the dog is barking, teach them the word ""quiet,"" and reinforce the command when they become silent with a treat or a silent rub.

, For instance, you will want to train your dog to avoid jumping up on people. Begin training by walking away backward and telling your dog the key phrase of ""off"" or ""down."" Only praise or reward your dog when all of their feet are back on the ground. You might consider teaching your dog to sit to greet newcomers as a substitute behavior for their jumping.


You can also train your Boxer to ""give."" This will help you ward off any guarding behavior later. You, as a dog parent, should be able to take any possession or food away from your dog. But in order to teach that to a dog, start out by doing an exchange. Offer a reward at first every time the dog gives you what you are trying to take away.
Then eventually begin substituting food with praise until eventually all it takes is a little praise to motivate the dog.

, Crate training is recommended for Boxers as a means of housebreaking the dog while you are away. Teach your Boxer to kennel by making sure that the crate becomes your dog's safe place. This draws on a dog's natural instinct to have a den.It should not be a punishment area, but instead work with your dog to make it a fun area by associating the word ""kennel"" or ""go to bed"" or something similar with the act of kenneling up. Be consistent with your phrasing, and use treats as needed to initially entice the animal into the pen. Make sure that your Boxer's crate makes them feel comfortable and does not become a source of anxiety for the dog.Here are the basic steps to crate training:


Leave the door open and stock the crate with treats so the dog discovers them and thinks what a great place the crate is.
Praise the dog when they go in of their own accord.
Feed the dog in the crate so they associate it with good things.
The first time you shut the door, praise the dog when they are quiet and only close the door for a minute. Gradually extend the time the door is closed, until they accept it as a great thing because they get a reward afterwards.

"
"
House-train your dog.,
Do clicker training.,
Consider crate training.",How to Train a Boxer Puppy2," Choose a cue word or phrase to use when you take your dog outside, such as ""Toilet time"". If you use this word from the beginning, your Boxer puppy will learn to associate it with doing what he is supposed to do outside. When you bring the puppy home, take him straight outside to the toilet spot. The chances are he'll have a sniff around and toilet. When he does, say the cue phrase and then give him lots of praise or even a small treat. You are rewarding the good behavior (toileting in the desired spot) so that he starts to understand this is an easy way of getting a lovely fuss made about him.When house-training a puppy, when possible take him outside every 20 to 30 minutes. This is to increase the chance of the puppy squatting as a matter of coincidence, and increases your chances of being there to give him lots of praise. Persistence at house-training is key.Watch your Boxer puppy carefully when he is inside. If he is walking in circles or sniffing the floor, he is likely getting ready to relieve himself. Take him outside immediately. If the puppy makes it outside, be sure to give him a treat and praise.
When house-training, keep your Boxer confined to one room, so there are fewer distractions for him. In addition, if he does have an accident, you can find it and deodorize the spot. A dog allowed to roam the house may squat secretly and, if you don't find it, the smell will draw the puppy back to urinate there again., Clicker training gets the dog to associate the ""click-clack"" sound of a clicker (pressed by you) with a reward. The clever part of the clicker is that it can mark the precise moment that a desired action took place, hence building a strong link between the action and reward. Boxers are highly trainable because they are very food-motivated, which makes clicker training ideal for them.Learn how to clicker train your dog. The clicker itself is a tiny plastic box held in the palm of your hand, with a metal tongue that you push quickly to make the sound. Eventually your dog will come to learn that clicks are always followed by treats, which is a very powerful incentive for Boxer puppies. One your dog makes this connection, you can use the click to mark the instant he performs the right behavior, such as sitting down. Over time, he will learn that sitting down when commanded gets him rewards.

, Crate training your Boxer is great idea. The idea is that the Boxer thinks of the crate as his den, a place where he's safe and can relax and sleep. Let the puppy discover the crate and want to go in voluntarily. The crate should be big enough for your puppy to turn all the way around, stand up and lie down. Boxers do grow to be fairly large, so you may have to invest in a larger crate as your puppy gets bigger.Learn how to crate train your dog or puppy. Make the crate an appealing place with a comfy dog bed, and scatter some treats inside. Give the puppy some meals in there but leave the door open. Once the puppy is happy to go to the crate, you can close the door for a few seconds, and open it again and if the puppy was quiet give her lots of praise.
Note that a crate should never be used as a punishment or a prison, and should only ever be used in a positive way.
Be aware of the following crate-time guidelines, and avoid leaving any dog in a crate for over five hours at a time (with the exception of overnight):

Age 9 to 10 weeks: 30 to 60 minutes
Age 11 to 14 weeks: 1 to 3 hours
Age 15 to 16 weeks, 3 to 4 hours.
Age 17+ weeks: 4 or more hours (but never more than six).

Research appropriate training methods.,
Find the right time and place for training.,
Be specific.,
Be firm and in control.,
Use hand gestures.,
Be timely and repetitive in your responses and commands.,
Be consistent.",How to Train a Boxer Puppy3," Before you start training your Boxer puppy—or, even better, before you get the puppy—read up on what kind of training is ideal for your breed. Check online, local libraries and local organizations. You can also ask your vet for advice. Remember, the more knowledgeable you are, the better you know how to react under different circumstances.


Make sure as well that you have what you need to effectively train your dog. If you're planning to clicker train, get a clicker. If you're planning to crate train, get the right-sized crate. Also be sure to pick up an appropriate collar and leash for general training. A leash should be no more than five to six feet in length. The best leashes for training are leather. Always check your equipment to make sure it is in good order and not liable to snap or break.

, Training works best when you dedicate a couple of short sessions (10 to 15 minutes) twice a day to it. Try to train at times when the dog is not tired, but also not bursting with pent-up energy.Consider expending your Boxer's energy before training sessions by allowing him 20 to 30 minutes of high intensity physical activity. This will enable him to better focus on training.A good time to choose to train a dog is just before a meal, so the dog will be very keen to work to earn those tasty treats.
Try to train the dog in a place where there are few distractions, so that your Boxer puppy can focus his attention on you. This means avoiding places with other animals or people. Always begin training in your home or yard and build up to environments with more distractions (e.g., other dogs and more people).

, Your commands need to be simple, short, clear and consistent. ""No"", ""Drop"", ""Wait"", ""Stop,"" and ""Fetch"" are strong, simple, and direct. Don't lecture your dog; they're not human so they don't process language in the same way. Phrases like ""I've told you not to do that"" or ""Please stop chewing on the table"" will not work as they are too complicated.Experts believe that a given dog registers the first part of the word as the most important, so longer commands such as ""Sit Fido if you want a treat"" are liable to confuse him. Just say the word ""Sit"" instead. In other words, for commands, choose words that are short and avoid long sentences

, In general, shouting at any dog is ineffective. This is especially true for Boxers who are a hyper breed by nature. Use a firm but pleasant and upbeat voice when instructing your dog; don't yell or lose control. Dogs are very intuitive and will be able to sense your frustration and may react in kind. Tone of voice matters, especially since, again, dogs don't process language in the same way that humans do. So how you say something may mean as much if not more than what you say.Boxers are playful by nature, and a light, breezy tone will not suffice; he will think you are just playing with him if you are not firm enough.

, Try using hand gestures at the same time as you issue verbal commands. For example, raise your hand at the same time as saying ""Sit"". Dog behaviorists believe that dogs look for multiple clues as to what we want them to do, which includes the command word, tone of voice, and body language., Admonishing a Boxer puppy too long after the incident is ineffective. If you need to admonish or correct your dog, it needs to be done during or within a few seconds of the act. Dogs will have forgotten the event within seconds of its occurrence, so it's key to address the behavior immediately in order to facilitate the retraining process.


Boxers are notoriously stubborn and steadfast, so you may have to correct your puppy numerous times.Boxers typically need 25 to 40 repetitions of a command before they can understand it., Always be consistent in your commands and desires of the dog. This helps your dog to understand what is expected. Don't forget to enforce training when you are out and about, so that your dog doesn't just thinking that ""Sit"" and ""Stay"" are things he has to do in the yard or house. By enforcing commands in public places it helps your Boxers to understand he must obey under all circumstances.Consistency is key to making good behaviors routine and normal and thus turns your dog into a well-trained and behaved pet! Leave no room for doubt about what is acceptable behavior for your Boxer puppy. If he is not allowed on the furniture, be consistent. Boxers won't understand the concept of ""sometimes""; they are either permitted to lie on the couch or they are not.
If you live with other people, make sure that everyone in the house is on board with the training program. and that everyone uses the same commands. Using different words for the same action will confuse the dog, disrupt the training already done, and ultimately delay progress.

"
Remember that dogs weren't born trained.,
Learn about the Boxer breed.,
Treat Boxers in a manner that befits their breed.",How to Train a Boxer Puppy4," Keep in mind that your puppy wasn't born automatically knowing the rules of living in a human world. When your boxer puppy gets overexcited or misbehaves, it isn't because he is a fundamentally bad dog, but because he doesn't know any better. It's your job to teach him new behaviors that appropriate for coexisting and living with other animals and humans as well.

, Doing so will help you understand your new Boxer puppy while training him. Boxer dogs are a delight but they're also exuberant clowns that have a lot of energy and need plenty of stimulation, including lots of playtime and walks. This can make an unruly Boxer a bit of a pain to be around as he may pounce on you, almost cat-like, to get your attention, which for a 60 to 70-pound dog can be quite painful. Also, the poorly trained Boxer may insist you play when he wants to, which again can be a nuisance if you want to quietly sit and watch TV.Boxers by nature are loyal to humans, they generally get along with other pets in the household, and they tend to like children, usually playing gently when appropriate. Build on and reward these positive traits when training your puppy.
Also bear in mind that Boxers have a reputation for taking up to three years to mature mentally, and can remain in a puppyish state until then, which for a big dog can be problematic if he wants to jump, pounce, paw, and dig at you. Luckily, good training can help settle your dog down.It's important to note as well that although Boxer dogs as a breed may share some general characteristics, just as people have different personalities, so too do Boxer dogs. Though the breed tends to be energetic and hyper, it's also possible that your puppy may be shy or more relaxed.

, You need to understand what they want and need in order to train them. Boxers are extremely intelligent but sometimes hide it well behind their boisterous facade. They like people and are eager to please them, making Boxers an ideal breed for reward-based training, which relies on rewarding good behavior, while ignoring behavior. In other words, mobilize these inner traits of the breed in the training process; indeed, doing this is key to successful training.Keep in mind that giving Boxer puppies what they need will help ensure that they don't engage in ""bad behaviors"". For example, Boxers need to play and be thoroughly walked. If you don't do this, they often become bored and destructive. Increased physical activity helps a dog stay healthy and also tires him out. Keep your dog active (and not destructive) by playing fetch and going on substantial walks at least twice a day.

Begin with dog training basics.,
Use food, praise, and toys as motivators.,
Consider clicker training.,
Spend no more than 20 minutes per training session without a break.",How to Train a German Shepherd2," German Shepherds are not necessarily any different than other dogs when it comes to training. If your dog does not know simple commands, such as sit and heel, then start with those.


It is important to begin training by building trust between you and your dog. Keep training sessions happy and short and give the dog a break in between lessons for play and a drink.

, Food is a powerful motivator for most dogs. Other dogs, particularly those with a high prey drive, respond well to toys as a reward. Either way, praise, in addition to a reward that is valuable to your dog, is used to communicate to your dog that they have performed well.


The timing of the reward is extremely important. Your praise and reward will need to come within two to three seconds of the behavior you are reinforcing. If the dog does something else in between the desired behavior and the reward, you are rewarding the last thing that the dog performed. For instance, if you want to teach the “sit” command, the praise and treat should be delivered when the dog is sitting with all feet on the ground. If you deliver the praise/treat with one paw up or as the dog starts getting up, you have just rewarded the dog for that most recent behavior.
Treats should be small and tasty. Consider three types: Low, medium and high value treats. Keep these in your arsenal to help your dog learn commands. When they first learn a new command, you may need medium or high value to treats to start them off and treat for every success. As they understand the command more, start adding in lower value treats intermittently. You can always go back to high value treats at any time you want to let the dog know they did something exceptionally great and you want them to remember that so you get that behavior again and again.
Gradually, you will phase out any treat and do more praise reward as the dog gets more consistent. You don’t want to create a dog that will only work for food and ignore you the rest of the time. That could become a dangerous situation.

, Clicker training is a method where the dog learns to associate the sound of the clicker as a positive “marker” for behavior.You start by clicking the device while feeding a high value treat over and over again so that the dog learns that the clicker sound means “very good.” After that association is made in the dog’s mind, you can create, or “shape,” behaviors by clicking as the dog performs a behavior you like. You can click faster than you can praise or treat, so by clicking you reward the dog instantly and then follow up the click with a treat. Clicker training is an incredible way to train dogs because they learn so fast with such immediate feedback.

, Spend even less time (5 to 10 minutes) for younger pups. Multiple shorter training session are generally more effective than one long one, particularly for puppies under 6 months of age. Their attention span is short and puppies get tired; your patience will be worn thin trying to train an over tired puppy. Training has to be upbeat and happy in order to get the maximum response from the dog. Play with the puppy in between and help them understand that people are fun and not all about “school” all the time.

Get your husky comfortable with the crate.,
Prepare to close the crate door.,
Place the crate in your bedroom if your husky fears being alone.,
Leave the house without your husky.",How to Train a Siberian Husky2," The crate should never be used as punishment as in a cage, jail, or time out. Instead, let your husky become comfortable with the crate by keeping the door open. Always use a gentle voice and give praise when your husky is in or near the crate so that fear does not creep in. Avoid forcing or tricking your husky to enter the crate.


If your husky refuses or fears to enter the crate, place a tasty treat inside as a lure. Let him discover the treat on his own. Do this several times a day as necessary.Word associations are important. When your husky enters the crate use the same word to make a positive association with entering the crate. The best method is to use the key word or phrase as the treat and husky enter the crate.
On the first day, in particular, repeat these procedures often so that your husky recognizes and becomes comfortable around the crate.

, At the end of the day, place the familiar treat inside the crate, after your husky enters, close the door. To ease anxiety, place an interesting new toy inside to focus attention away from the closed door. Continue to provide company outside the crate until any crying or whining subsides. Keep your husky in the crate until there has been at least 30 to 60 seconds of silence. Resist the urge to let your husky out of the crate before reaching the minimum amount of time of silence or using corrective language to keep quiet.


Always have an extra toy available if the treat and initial toy fail to keep your husky from whining or crying. It is important to keep the focus off of the closed door.
A good strategy would be to exercise or play with your husky until they become tired and then place them inside the crate when they are sleepy. If your husky falls asleep inside the crate, let them sleep there overnight.
Be mindful not to praise your husky in the morning for staying peacefully inside the crate. This gives the dog the illusion that it is better to be out rather than in the crate. Indeed, pay little attention to your husky for the first couple of moments after exiting the crate to reduce this illusion.

, Siberian Huskies are pack dogs and like to be close to their “alpha,” plus this gives them reassurance that they are not being abandoned. Use your voice or place your fingers inside the crate to comfort the dog’s fears. Unless your husky has to potty, keep the crate door closed for at least four hours.


Comfort is the key. Therefore, if your husky soils the crate do not scold or discipline.
Keep the crate in the bedroom for a few nights until the routine becomes familiar. Once your husky no longer whines or soils the crate, you can place him somewhere else in the house.

, This should not be treated as some special event; rather, it is best to leave without calling attention to your departure so your husky does not fret.


Practice first until it becomes routine. Increase the time increments that you pretend to leave the house during training until you achieve two hours. Remember, if you have a puppy, they have to potty every four hours. Therefore, during training, make arrangements to come home or have a neighbor let the puppy out of the crate to potty.
It is a wise idea to inform neighbors that you are crating your husky since extended “howling” is natural when feeling lonely.
Siberian Huskies are masters of escape. When you leave the house, make sure that all unsafe toys, collars, and cords are removed from or near the crate so that the husky does not get injured.

Build mutual respect between the dog and children.,
Identify potential risk factors.,
Understand your husky's body language.,
Get your husky ready for the arrival of a newborn.",How to Train a Siberian Husky3," The Siberian Husky, although generally child-friendly, needs to have social boundaries – no jumping, grabbing, chasing, bolting, or pulling – established. Children should follow similar boundaries – no teasing; roughing; chasing; pulling hair, tail, or ears; or tug-of-war. Children should help train your husky under adult supervision so that the husky becomes comfortable and familiar with all family members.
Teaching children to gently pet and touch a husky, instead of pulling or hitting, helps build a trusting friendship and affection for each other.

, Other than bringing home a puppy, an unfamiliar husky’s background should always be taken into account around children. Find out if the husky was raised or socialized with children previously to bringing them home. Check to see if the husky ever received training for contact with children. Visually watch your husky around children to identify irritability, nervousness, or growling. Naturally, Siberian Huskies have an instinct to chase small animals and sometimes children. Because huskies see small animals, like cats, as food, they might mistake babies or toddlers as part of the pack (family) and mistakenly attack them.
Always have a new dog on a leash around children so that you remain in control and can prevent any injury.

, Few children will understand the meaning of a dog’s body language unless they are taught to identify aggressive behavior. Angry dogs typically bark, growl, show their teeth, and stare at their target. Children should never approach a dog under these circumstances. Instead, the child should immediately stop moving, stand up straight with arms at their side and legs close together, and look away from the dog to avoid eye contact. If the dog attacks anyways, the child should drop to the ground, curl up with knees to the chest, and arms covering the face with fists over the ears. Disengage by being quiet. , Training should begin several weeks or months prior to a newborn’s arrival. Obedience training – how to sit, stay, lie down, or approach – should commence immediately and continue until your husky becomes reliable.


Practice at home with a baby doll to simulate situations, smells, and new sounds where it is essential for your husky to obey a command. Make sure not to get lulled into a false sense of security. If your husky is not obeying commands completely and regularly it might be best to seek out a good obedience school or trainer.
To prevent the dog from jumping, wildly sniffing, or misbehaving in general, the mother should greet the husky upon arrival without the baby for a few minutes until the excitement winds down. This also presents an opportunity for your husky to sniff mom’s clothes for new smells. Once your husky is relaxed the baby can be introduced.
It is natural to give more attention to your newborn baby than to your dog. Nevertheless, do not neglect your dog or make him jealous. Prepare in advance by gradually reducing the amount of attention the dog normally receives a few weeks in advance of the baby’s arrival.
Infants are different from children. Dogs usually identify children as people but this is not always true with infants. Become familiar with your dog’s “typical” behavior and reactions around children. Check to make sure the dog imitates this behavior around the baby. "

Check the newspaper.,
Check local online communities.,
Look for posters.",How to Find Dogs Needing to Be Rehomed1," Check your local newspaper’s personal ads both online and in print for notices that indicate a pet needs rehoming. These could include ads from people moving and looking to rehome a pet or notices about puppies for adoption after someone’s pet gave birth.Look both in “Pet” and “For Sale” categories if your newspaper breaks up ads by types.;
, Look online at websites such as Craigslist and local pet care or pet adoption forums to see if anyone in your area is looking to rehome a dog. You can also place “Wanted” ads in these communities stating that you are looking for a dog to rehome.Adoption websites often offer rehoming forums and community message boards to help owners find a new home for their dogs without having to put them in a shelter.
Be cautious about unscrupulous breeders trying to sell people puppies by offering them for “adoption” but attaching unreasonable rehoming fees in excess of $500.

, Check areas such as community centers, recreation center, local dog parks, coffee shops, campus bulletin boards, and other areas where community information is posted to look for flyers indicating a pet needs to be rehomed. Check different places to see different dogs.These boards are often cleaned and changed out regularly, generally about once a month. Check back regularly to see if any new flyers show up offering a dog to a good home.
Remember to have something handy when looking at flyers to record contact information such as phone number or email address.

Decide why you need a guard dog.,
Determine if a guard dog is right for your home.,
Research different breeds.,
Determine what age you want.,
Avoid certain breeds.,
Consider a dark-colored dog.",How to Find a Good Guard Dog1," If you know why you need a guard dog, you may be able to find one that is best suited to your purposes. Guard dogs should be used to defend your home and property; they should not attack any stranger at will. Instead, they need cautious instincts to know when their family is in danger and when they are safe. You might need a guard dog to:


Alert you if strangers are nearby.
Protect livestock from predators.
Scare away burglars or home invaders.;
, Good guard dogs tend to be territorial, although they should also act aloof towards strangers. These behaviors mean that they may not be suited for all homes. A guard dog may not work well for:


Homes with young children
Apartments that share common hallways and walls
Properties that strangers, such as utility workers or customers, must frequently access.

, Some breeds were produced for their ability to guard homes. These breeds are highly trainable, loyal, alert, and energetic. Both large and small breeds can function as guard dogs, depending on your needs. Look for a breed that is adapted for your specific purpose.


Rottweilers are good for protecting homes and property.
Mastiffs are good at protecting families.
Great Danes are great with children. Their large size makes them menacing to strangers, but they are not an aggressive breed. They are also effective watchdogs.
Great Pyrenees can guard livestock.Doberman Pinschers, bull terriers, pulis, and Rhodesian Ridgebacks also make good guard dogs.Mixed dogs can also be effective guard dogs too. While you may not be able to identify their temperament from their breed, you can still evaluate them for good guard dog characteristics.

, There are pros and cons to adopting either a puppy or older dog as a guard dog. A puppy will bond to your family from a younger age, giving them a stronger instinct to protect your family. That said, they may not be able to effectively guard the house until they are a couple years old. An older dog may take some time to warm up to your family, but you can start training them sooner to guard your home.


Dogs do not start barking to protect their territory until they are least nine months old, and some may not start until they are three years old., While many dogs have good temperaments to be a guard or watch dog, there are some breeds that generally do not work. This may because they do not bark as much, act calm or friendly around strangers, or have a high prey drive. These breeds include:


Bloodhound
Newfoundland
Saint Bernard
Basset Hound
Bulldog
Old English Sheepdog
Irish Wolfhound
Scottish Deerhound
Pug
Siberian Husky
Alaskan Malamute, A dog with a dark or black colored coat may appear more menacing to intruders, and their ability to blend may make them more difficult to catch at night. While looking for dogs, keep darker dogs in mind."

Make an initial evaluation of all the dogs available for adoption.,
Observe how the dogs interact with other dogs.,
Select a few dogs for further interactions.,
Ask about the dog’s behavior.,
Inquire about the dog’s family history and genetics.,
Interact with the dog in a quiet area.,
Let the dog sniff around and become comfortable in the testing area.,
Look out for aggressive behaviors.,
Call the dog to approach you.,
Test the dog’s reaction to changes in your tone of voice.,
Touch the dog.,
Play with a toy.,
Test their responsiveness to food.,
Learn about the behavioral characteristics of various breeds.,
Understand the factors that influence temperament.,
Go to a reputable breeder or shelter.,
Know the ideal temperament for your needs.",How to Evaluate a Dog's Temperament Before Choosing," When you go to a shelter, you want to see every dog that is available before you start to single out potential pets. If you are at a shelter, go past every cage to see how each dog appears initially. Observe from a distance at first to see how the dog perceives your presence. After this initial observation, go up to the cage and offer your hand. The dog should approach you and sniff your hand.


Dogs that bark loudly or lunge at your hand should be avoided.
Take notes on which dogs stand out to you so you can revisit them and conduct further assessments.;
, If you are at a breeder, you should observe how littermates interact with their siblings and their parents. Young puppies should play with their littermates and display friendly behaviors towards other dogs. In shelters, dogs may bark when other dogs bark, bare their teeth towards other dogs, or cower when other dogs approach their cage.


It is very important to consider how the dog interacts with other dogs, especially if you have another dog in your home.
Behaviors like growling and baring teeth are undesirable and indicate that the dog may be aggressive.

, After making your initial observations, you should have a general idea of a few dogs that you’re interested in meeting and spending time with. You can return to their cages and see how the dogs interact with you. Ideally, they should be interested in engaging with you and approach you to sniff your hand and react to the sound of your voice.Keep in mind that some dogs that are in shelters are more nervous and skittish if they have been rescued from abusive situations. They may need a little more time to become comfortable with you, but they can still be great pets., While you’ll need the opportunity to see the dog’s temperament for yourself, you should talk to the breeder or shelter staff members to hear their perspectives on the dog’s behavior. This outside perspective can help you to discern whether your own evaluation of the dog’s temperament seems to be accurate or not.Keep in mind that the breeder has a vested interest in making sure their dog is purchased, so their assessment of the dog’s behavior may be influenced. Take their assessment cautiously if they seem overly eager to ignore any bad behaviors or habits the dog seems to have.

, A reputable breeder should be able to give you a full picture about the dog’s family history and genetics. Genetics can influence a dog’s temperament and can also indicate whether the dog is predisposed towards certain health conditions.You may not have access to this information at a shelter, especially if the dog has been rescued. You can proceed without this information, but any information that the shelter does have available can be very helpful in your discernment process.

, Shelters are often chaotic, and dogs at shelters may have been rescued from abusive environments, be skittish, or distracted by the barking and presence of dozens of other dogs. The environment can influence a dog’s temperament, so it is important to conduct temperament testing in a quiet and secure area. Ideally, you should be spending 30 to 60 minutes with the dog when you are considering adopting them. This gives the dog time to warm up to you and it also gives you more time to evaluate their temperament.


Ask the shelter staff members to take you to an interaction room where you can socialize with the dog. If you are at a breeder, they should have an area where you can interact with the puppy or adult dog in a secure and quiet space.

, The dog will need a few minutes to adjust to their new surroundings, especially if they have been in a cage in the shelter for extended periods of time. You’re going to be looking to evaluate the dog and determine whether they have a responsive, nervous, or independent personality.A responsive dog is one that is curious, interested in engaging with you, and is responsive to your actions by matching their actions to yours. A nervous or shy dog will be hesitant to engage with you, may cower in fear, or try to avoid you. An independent dog will be aloof, won’t react to anything you do, and is generally uninterested in being tested.

, While your initial assessment should weed out any aggressive dogs, since you won’t ask to see a dog that lunges or barks loudly when you approach, you should keep an eye out for any aggressive behaviors. These can range from barks that sound threatening to showing teeth, snapping, or biting. If you ever see any aggressive behaviors, stop the assessment immediately.


Reputable shelters should identify aggressive dogs and ensure that they aren't up for adoption, but you will need to look out for these behaviors as well.

, A responsive dog will wag their tail and respond when called. They may approach you slowly, but will generally display signs that they are interested in you by wagging their tail, sniffing the air, and nudging you with their nose. A nervous dog may cower and avoid interaction, though they are still acknowledging that you are calling them. An independent dog will ignore you and continue to sniff around without paying attention to you., Talk to the dog in a high-pitched and squeaky voice for 30 seconds. Stop speaking suddenly and become neutral. You are testing to see whether the dog is responsive to changes in your behavior.A responsive dog will stop and notice that your demeanor and voice has changed. A shy dog will continue to avoid interacting with you. An independent dog won’t notice that there has been any change in your behavior and continue acting as they were while you were speaking in the different voice., This part of the temperament evaluation needs to be approached cautiously because it puts you within the dog’s personal space, where they can display aggressive behaviors if they feel threatened.Begin by offering the dog a treat. As they move towards you to take the treat, gently touch them on the head and pet down their back.


A responsive dog will welcome your touch and enjoy being petted. A nervous dog will try to cower away from you and avoid being touched. An independent dog will try to take the treat from you and leave without engaging with you.
A dog that doesn’t like to be touched isn’t necessarily a bad pet. They shouldn’t be in homes with small children, but they can still be family members.

, This tests how possessive the dog is over objects and whether they are interested in playing with you. Roll a toy over to the dog and see whether they pick it up and try to play with you. Excitedly play with the dog and the toy for a minute and then stop. Drop the toy and gauge the dog’s reaction.A responsive dog will play with you and notice your sudden change in behavior. Nervous dogs avoid playing with you. Independent dogs won’t notice your change in behavior and continue to play.

, Give the dog a small amount of food in a bowl. Let the dog begin to eat some of the food, but before they are able to finish all of the food use a long stick or broom handle to pull the bowl away from their reach.Responsive dogs will look expectantly at you, wag their tails, and try to encourage you to let them continue to eat. A nervous dog will be too shy and afraid to eat. An independent dog will act disinterested in the food.

, While the dog’s breed can give you a general idea about the dog’s disposition, it cannot give you a guarantee about what the dog will actually be like. By doing your research about different dog breeds, you can get a general idea of what to expect.Some breeds, like Golden Retrievers, are known for being lovable goofballs but not every dog within that breed fits that description. There are exceptions to every rule, and you won’t know whether this dog is that exception until you have a chance to interact with it.

, A dog’s temperament is the general attitude that the dog displays towards people, other animals, and how they interact with others. A dog’s temperament is influenced by both genetic and learned traits, as well as their environment and situational awareness. Much of a dog’s behavior is hereditary and inherited, but some aspects can be modified and influenced through training.A dog’s temperament can shift throughout their lifetime, though rarely will this shift be drastic. For example, a hyperactive young dog can mature into a more calm and gentle senior dog. , In order to evaluate a dog’s temperament, you will need to be in a controlled environment. Reputable shelters will have a separate area where potential adopters can interact with dogs and get to know them. Reputable breeders will be happy to allow you to interact with their puppies in safe and controlled areas before you adopt them. If the shelter or the breeder does not allow you to interact with a dog before either purchasing or adopting them, walk away.


Safety is key. The area where you interact with the dog should be safe and comfortable for all the parties involved.

, A dog’s temperament is a very important factor to take into consideration when you’re choosing a new pet. Their personality and behavior can fit your lifestyle, or make you incompatible. In order to choose a dog based on their temperament, you need to have a good idea of what sort of dog will work best with your lifestyle.Ask yourself what sort of pet would work best for your family and lifestyle. Do you work full time and know that you’ll leave a dog alone for most of the day? A high energy or needy dog might not be right for you. Families with small children won’t do well with dogs that are aggressive or aren’t gentle.

Gauge the cost of a dog walker.",How to Estimate the Cost of Owning a Dog," Depending on the breed, buying a dog from a reputable breeder can cost between $300 and $1,500. More common breeds, such as Labrador or golden retrievers, typically cost less than rare breeds, such as Tibetan mastiffs, or breeds that have smaller litters, like English bulldogs or Yorkshire terriers.When you buy a dog from a breeder, the cost usually includes a health certificate from a veterinarian, several rounds of vaccinations, and de-worming if needed.


Buying a dog from a reputable breeder may be more expensive, but the higher price tag may save money on veterinary bills and training later on. A dog purchased from a backyard breeder or a puppy mill is more likely to have genetic health problems or behavioral problems due to poor breeding standards. In addition, responsible breeders want to meet the potential new owner to make sure the dog is going to a good home, so they do not sell dogs to pet stores.Ask a veterinarian for recommendations for responsible dog breeders in your area, or talk to a local breed club for referrals.;
, When you adopt a dog from a shelter or a rescue group, you will pay an adoption fee that can range anywhere between $25 to $300.A dog breed that is popular or in-demand may have a higher adoption fee than a senior dog or a dog with a disability or illness.This fee will go toward paying some of your dog’s initial medical costs, which can include the cost of rabies and distemper vaccinations, spaying or neutering, and heartworm tests.This fee also helps the shelter provide care for other animals and helps to support the organization.

, Microchipping can offer you peace of mind should your dog run away or get lost. When your dog is found, a shelter or veterinarian can scan the chip and identify your dog. The one-time $45 cost is a relatively inexpensive way to protect your new best friend.Some rescue organizations include the cost of microchipping in the adoption fee. Be sure to ask a representative at a shelter if microchipping is an option for your dog.

, Purchasing food for your dog can cost anywhere between $120 and $500 each year. Although it may seem like the budget-friendly choice to grab the bag of the cheapest dog food, purchasing a more expensive, higher quality food can be more cost-effective.The higher-quality food is packed with more essential nutrients that will help nourish your dog, which means they will eat less food. Talk to your veterinarian about selecting the best food for your dog.


Selecting a higher-quality dog food can also help with veterinarian bills. Dogs who receive more nutrients and minerals in their diet typically have fewer health problems and don’t require as many visits to the veterinarian.
Choose a dog food that lists animal protein such as beef, chicken, or lamb as its first ingredient. Search for other familiar, wholesome ingredients like vegetables, grains, and fruits on the label to ensure that your dog will be receiving a high-quality diet., Playtime is an important aspect in a dog’s life. It stimulates the mind, helps prevent boredom, and helps your dog get some exercise, so it is important to provide it with some toys.The level of playtime rowdiness can vary from dog to dog and breed to breed. Some dogs keep toys intact, while other dogs are prone to chewing and may try to destroy their toys. If you have to replace a toy frequently, this cost can add up.


On average, toys for small dogs can cost around $40 each year, while toys for larger dogs can cost around $75 each year., A dog bed can cost between $25 to $100, and if the bed is of high-quality and remains in good condition, it can last for several years.Look for washable beds so you can keep the bed free from dirt, odors, and pests. Talk to your veterinarian to decide what type of bed would be best for your pet.

, It is important to consider the everyday costs of owning a dog, which can include the cost of dog treats to the cost of professional training. Each dog will need a collar and a leash, for example, which can cost between $8 to $20 dollars. If your dog needs a dog crate, that may cost between $40 to $150 dollars, depending on its size and quality.Some cities and towns have a yearly registration fee, which can cost between $10 to $20 dollars.If your dog needs a safe place to play, factor in the cost of fencing in your yard.

, The price for neutering or spaying your dog depends on the size of the animal. For a small dog, the procedure can run up to $190. A medium dog will cost around $200, while the procedure for a larger dog can cost about $220.This one-time expense is an important measure that every responsible dog owner should take.


Many rescue organizations and shelters automatically include the cost of spaying or neutering your dog in the adoption fee.
Call your local Humane Society and ask about low-cost clinics and services., Talk to your veterinarian to see if your dog is likely to develop any health problems based on its breed. See if your veterinarian has any recommendations for preventing these issues. Prevention can help save on future visits to the vet or on treatment options.


Some dogs, like Labrador retrievers or bulldogs, are prone to hip dysplasia, while other breeds, like cocker spaniels and border collies, may be more likely to develop eye problems.Mixed breeds usually have fewer health problems than purebred dogs., Fleas and ticks can carry diseases, and heartworm disease can be a threatening and fatal illness. It is important for your dog’s health that these irritating and dangerous critters are kept at bay. There are a variety of products that can help control fleas and ticks, such as shampoos, powders, and monthly treatments. For heartworms, a monthly pill or treatment is needed. Ask your veterinarian what treatment they would recommend.


Heartworm medicine can cost anywhere from $10 to $25 dollars annually, while flea and tick prevention can cost between $200 and $500 each year., If your dog is ill, it may need to take other medications prescribed by your veterinarian. Antibiotics help treat various infections, including gastrointestinal, eye, and urinary tract infections. On average, a bottle of antibiotics can cost roughly $20.If your dog suffers from arthritis, it may require an anti-inflammatory pill or injection to reduce pain and swelling in the joints. Anti-inflammatories can cost $40 to $90 dollars per bottle., A typical office visit to a veterinarian can cost between $45 and $55 each visit but can vary depending on your location. If your dog requires booster shots or vaccinations during a typical office visit, an extra $18 to $25 may be included in your bill. During a yearly check-up, your dog will require a fecal examination to check for heartworms, which can add an extra $25 to $45 to the overall cost of the visit.If your dog requires a comprehensive bloodwork test to help diagnose a problem, it can cost between $85 and $150. A minor bloodwork test can cost roughly $50 to $80., Your dog may require x-rays or an ultrasound to help diagnose a health problem. An x-ray can cost between $40 and $125, and an abdominal ultrasound can be around $250. These costs can increase if your dog requires anesthesia. Anesthesia can cost up to $200 for large breeds and $180 for small breeds., Emergency veterinary costs can range depending on the severity of your dog’s condition and the treatment options needed, but the totals can easily accumulate to thousands of dollars.If your dog is hit by a car, for example, the treatment can cost over $5,000, while a gastrointestinal surgery can be around $3,000. It is recommended to have an emergency fund set aside for your pet., Pet insurance can help cover the costs of veterinary visits, emergency situations, or unexpected surgery.The average cost of pet insurance is $492 each year, but it can vary depending on the breed of dog, your location, and your coverage options.Health insurance is an added annual expense, but it can help cover your pet in case of an emergency. Be sure to shop around to find the best rate and coverage for your pet.

, If you are away from home for several hours each day, you may wish to consider sending your dog to a daycare when you are gone. Dogs are social animals, and being alone can cause anxiety and boredom, which can lead to destructive behavior.Sending your dog to daycare is a great way to make sure your dog is getting the attention, socialization, and exercise it needs, but the expenses can add up.


Sending your dog to daycare can cost anywhere between $15 to $50 each day, depending on your location. To send your dog to daycare 3 days per week, you could be spending between $180 to $600 every month, which is $2,160 to $7,000 every year.

, When you are out of town or going on vacation, sometimes you may not be able to take your lovable companion with you. You will need to board your dog at a kennel or dog hotel, and prices can vary depending on your location. Some kennels charge a fee depending on the size of your dog, which can be as little as $20 dollars per day. Other extravagant dog hotels can charge as much as $53 per night.


If you plan to go away for a week, you could expect a bill between $140 and $371 if you place your dog in a kennel or dog hotel.Offer a friend a small fee to dog sit while you’re away., If you are away during the day and want to make sure your dog is getting enough exercise, consider hiring a dog walker. Someone from a dog walking service will arrive at your home on a designated day and take your dog for walk, which typically lasts between 15 minutes to 1 hour. These services usually charge per dog and not by breed or size.


A 15-minute walk can cost about $15 per dog, while an hour-long walk can run up to $27 per dog. If you elect to have a dog walker come for an hour-long walk each week, you could be paying around $1,400 dollars each year.

Decide if you’d prefer a puppy or an adult dog.,
Decide if you’d like a purebred dog or not.,
Consider dogs in need.,
Avoid puppy mills.,
Factor in the costs.,
Keep your ideal timeline in mind.,
Consider how far you’re willing to travel.",How to Determine Where to Get Your Dog1," Puppies have much higher energy and require a lot of care and training, but many owners appreciate having more control over their dog’s upbringing, socialization, and training. Go for an adult dog if you would like a pet that already has their basic training and will be easier to care for from the start. Since they’ve already been socialized, adult dogs also have the advantage of being “known entities” when it comes to their general behavior, personality, and temperament.If you’d rather have an adult dog, breeders are probably not your best bet since they generally specialize in puppies.
Shelters and rescues do have some puppies available, but generally about 75% of their adoptees are adult dogs.;
, While shelters do have a significant number of purebred dogs, you’re most likely to get healthy purebred dogs with papers from a responsible breeder. The stock of shelters is very variable, which means that it can be difficult to track down a specific breed of dog if that’s what you’re looking for.Some people prefer purebred dogs because they would like a pet with specific physical and behavioral traits. For instance, if you’re a hunter, you may want a Labrador Retriever or a Pointer, since these types of dogs have been specifically bred as hunting companions. Or, if you live in an urban apartment, you might want a toy breed, like a French Bulldog, that are uniquely amenable to city life.
Purebred dogs also come with significant cons. The main one is that they tend to have more health issues since they’re far more prone to hereditary and genetic disorders and diseases than mixed breeds. Another is that many types of dogs were bred to have specific working behaviors, like hunting or herding, that are difficult for an average pet owner to manage.
If you don’t know exactly which characteristics you’re looking for, there’s little reason to get a purebred dog. Even if you do know, keep in mind that getting a purebred pooch is no guarantee that your individual dog will fulfill all the expectations associated with its breed as a whole.

, Millions of pets are consigned to shelters each year. Only about half of them will ever be adopted. You can do your part by choosing a rescued or neglected dog for your pet.Remember: just because a dog is in a shelter does not necessarily mean that they will not make a great family pet.
Keep in mind that dogs end up in shelters for a huge variety of reasons and through no fault of their own. Their previous owners may have moved, passed away, or simply abandoned them.
If you’d like an adult purebred dog, you might consider a rescue organization. They exist for most breeds and specialize in rehoming orphaned or neglected adult dogs.

, Puppy mills are large commercial facilities that are known to employ unsafe or unethical breeding practices. They typically place profit over the wellbeing of their stock, often keeping parents and puppies in unsanitary and/or inhumane conditions. Many mill puppies are born with genetic defects and come with behavioral problems due to their negligent care.The only way to be sure that a dog has not come from a puppy mill is to see the place that they came from in person so that you can inspect the conditions and see that the dogs are well-treated. Responsible breeders will allow site visits and insist on meeting buyers face-to-face.
Keep in mind that a dog’s being AKC-registered or their breeder being “licensed by the USDA” are not guarantees that they did not come from a mill. These forms do not require site visits for approval.
Most pet stores, both physical and online, don’t have sterling reputations for healthy puppies or ethical breeding practices since they’re businesses that don’t specialize in breeding. Most of their stock is likely to come from puppy mills. If you’d like a purebred dog, your best bet is getting one from a reputable breeder.

, Getting a puppy from a breeder will be considerably more expensive than adopting a dog from a shelter or other organization. Adoption fees can range anywhere from $25 to $300. Breeders’ sales fees usually start at $500 and can go as high as several thousand dollars, depending on the breed.The high price tags for purebred puppies reflect the considerable costs of humane and ethical breeding practices. Thus, many people think that it’s a good value for their money.
Adoption fees at shelters generally include most of a dog’s basic medical care, which is a huge savings of time and money for you. If you’re interested in the convenience of having a dog that’s already spayed or neutered, microchipped, and dewormed, then a shelter may be the place to get your pet., If you’d like a dog sooner rather than later, a breeder or rescue may not be right for you. Shelters generally have the fastest turnaround time for adoption. If you’re invested in getting a specific type of dog, then getting on a breeder’s waitlist for a puppy or a rescue’s waitlist for an adult dog can be worth it.

, If you’re looking for a specific breed, you’ll often have to search beyond your local area to find the right dog since there may not be a reputable breeder in your immediate vicinity. Rescues also often require travel since their adoptees will come from unpredictable places.


If you want to find a dog locally, a shelter is probably your best bet.

Check with shelters.,
Ask fosters.,
Work with long distance rescues.",How to Find Dogs Needing to Be Rehomed2," Call or go into your local shelter and ask if they have any dogs that they cannot keep at the shelter any longer that are in need of a home. This is especially useful for shelters that practice putting down dogs who haven’t been adopted after a certain amount of time.Let the shelter know why you are looking for dogs to rehome. They may have certain limits regarding personal adoptions versus you coming in as part of a rescue.

, Many shelters place dogs in foster homes when they do not have space or resources for them at the shelter. Ask your local animal shelter if they have any dogs currently in foster care looking to be rehomed.Keep in mind that if you are not looking to adopt the dog directly, it may be best to leave the dog at its foster home where it will get more personal attention and care than it would in a rescue facility.

, Some rescues operate entirely by bringing dogs in long distance from high-kill shelters in underfunded and underserved areas. These rescues are always in need of people to take care of the animals and find them good homes once they arrive.If you choose to work with a long distance shelter, make clear to them whether you are looking to adopt the dogs or whether you are operating as an extension of their rescue with intention to rehome the dogs.
Ensure that you have proper space and supplies for the dogs coming in, as these rescues do not have any facilities of their own for the pets.

Check areas such as parks, alleys, or anywhere else a dog might be able to scavenge first.If you notice a dog living in poor conditions, such as being harmed or kept outdoors in inclement or threatening conditions, contact your local Animal Control office or Humane Society to file a formal report. Do not pursue the dog yourself.
Be prepared for the increased vet expenses that can come with helping a stray or abandoned dogs. These dogs are often malnourished and may have other physical problems that need immediate medical attention.

, Veterinary offices often get notices about pets that need a new home. Work with vets in your area to see if they get any information about dogs that need rehoming.Some vet offices may have a bulletin or notifications board you can check for this information.
Pets are also sometimes abandoned at a vet’s office. Work with your vet to get notifications if a dog is abandoned at their practice.

, Check with your local animal control or animal rescue department to see if they work with volunteers. If so, volunteer and use your work as an opportunity to find and help dogs that need to be rehomed.Remember that these dogs need to go through the proper channels before they get to you. This means that they need to be reported to and checked out by animal control before they can be released or adopted.
Only volunteer if you are committed to working with your animal rescue department and following their rules and protocol.

Contact breeders.,
Visit dog shelters and rescue organizations.,
Consider adopting a former police or military dog.",How to Find a Good Guard Dog2," Many good guard dogs are brought up within the family from a young age. This allows them to bond with their families so that they can protect them later in life. If you have identified a specific breed that you want, see if there are any local breeders. Contact them, and ask if they will have any litters of puppies available for adoption soon.


Puppies bought at puppy stores are often sourced from puppy mills. You should look for a responsible breeder who has certifications and recommendations from a recognized kennel club., You do not necessarily need a purebred puppy to have a good guard dog. You may be able to find one at a shelter or rescue organization instead. Visit various shelters in your area to see if they have a suitable dog.


When you visit, let the volunteers or workers know that you want a guard dog. Ask them if they know of any good candidates.
Some rescue organizations are breed specific. This means that you may be able to adopt a purebred rescue at a much lower cost than buying a puppy from a breeder.

, Sometimes military or police dogs are retired because they can longer perform their duties, but that does not mean that they cannot stop working entirely. These dogs are often already trained for security purposes. You can contact a service dog rescue organization to see if there are any good candidates available.You can look at:


The Military Working Dog School

Mission K9 Rescue
United States War Dogs Association
Keep in mind that some working dog rescue organizations may want you to sign a contract stating that you will not use these dogs for security work."
"
Ask to see the dog separately.,
Assess their fear and anxiety.,
Play with them.,
Perform a temperament test.",How to Find a Good Guard Dog3," Whether you are visiting a shelter, rescue, or breeder, you should try to find some time alone with the dog. Most shelters will have a separate room where you can interact and play with the dog. This will let you see if the dog has the appropriate temperament to be a guard dog. Qualities you are looking for in these dogs include:


High energy
Alertness
PatienceConfidence
Assertiveness
Trainability
Sociability, The best guard dog is one that acts friendly and calm when you’re not in danger but who can jump into action when an intruder or threat is near. A dog that acts out of fear and anxiety will become aggressive not just toward strangers but towards family members, children, and non-threatening guests.When meeting a potential dog, look for signs of anxiety or fear, such as:


Licking their lips
Lips pulled back
Ears pressed against their skull
Growling
Whimpering
Staring, A good guard dog will be energetic and alert. This means that they will willingly play games like fetch and tug-of-war with you. While you play with them, make sure that they are engaging with you and keeping their attention focused on you. When you are ready to end the game, they should listen to your commands to quit.Dogs that try to protect or steal toys from you may not make ideal guard dogs. Not only are they not responding to you but they may be too aggressive to be effective.

, While many people expect guard dogs to be aggressive, aggressive temperaments can make a dog a poor guard dog as the dog will attack anyone who comes near the home, not just potential threats. Instead you should try to find a dog with a responsive temperament, who will listen to commands and train easily. While visiting a potential dog, you can do a brief temperament test.


Try to put a leash on the dog. The dog should let you put a leash on and will walk next to you. If the dog snarls at you or lunges at other animals or people, they may be too aggressive.
When you play with the dog, the dog should engage and interact with you. They should not run away with the toys or snarl at you to protect the toys.
The dog should relax when you pet them. If they run away or cower, they may be too shy to be an effective guard dog."
"
Introduce the dog to the entire family.,
Socialize the dog.,
Prepare to train the dog.",How to Find a Good Guard Dog4," A guard dog should be able to socialize, bond, and protect the entire family. As soon as the dog enters the house, introduce them on a leash to each person living in the home. Encourage all family members to pet and interact with the dog. This will let them start to bond with their family, and it can foster loyalty to the family soon after their arrival.

, If you have a puppy, you should begin socializing them immediately. Bring different strangers into the house to meet and interact with the puppy. This will train your puppy that not all strangers are bad, and it can help them more accurately judge a bad situation, instead attacking or lunging at every single person who enters your home.A good guard dog should be aloof towards strangers. This means that they recognize strangers and may even bark at strangers, but they will not lunge towards, attack, or bite strangers.You do not have to worry about socialization reducing the effectiveness of the guard dog. Proper socialization will reduce fear and aggression in the dogs, and it will teach them the difference between a positive experience with a stranger and a negative one.

, Guard dogs require extensive training. They should respond to simple commands. Not only should they act in situations to protect you, but they must back off once you command them to stop. Training should begin as young as possible. Use positive reinforcement, and reward the dog with treats when they do something correctly. This will give you better results than yelling or physically disciplining the dog.You will need to train your dog how to:


Bark on command
Stop barking on command
Leave strangers alone"

Find a shelter or rescue near you.,
Make sure that the shelter or rescue is a nonprofit.,
Tour the facility.,
Inquire about the adoption process.,
Ask for a behavioral analysis.,
Ask about health checks.,
See if they offer a trial period.",How to Determine Where to Get Your Dog2," You can either search for a specific facility that’s located in your area, or search for those rescue pets that are available in your area.


The Shelter Pet Project and PetFinderhave helpful search tools for locating rescue dogs near you.
The Humane Society also offers valuable resources for finding local shelters.If you’re interested in a specific breed, do an online search for a rescue associated with it. The American Kennel Club also hosts a network of all the largest breed rescue organizations that you can search., Responsible shelters and rescues will be registered as 501(c)(3) charities. This helps establish that they are legitimate organizations for animal protection and welfare, not puppy mills., While most shelters aren’t fancy, they should still be making an effort to keep their animals healthy and clean. Be sure that the conditions are sanitary and that the dogs look well-fed and well-cared-for.At the very least, dogs should have access to water, a living space that clear of dirt or feces, and an exercise area.

, Most shelters and rescues will have an adoption application process that requires you to submit personal references. Some may also require a home visit to establish that the dog will have good living conditions. Find out the requirements and timeline for your facility.Thorough adoption processes are strong indicators of responsible organizations. They’re proof that shelters and rescues are trying to do what’s best for you and for their dogs.

, Most shelters and rescues offer evaluations of each dog’s temperament and socialization. Be sure that whichever facility you’re getting a dog from is up-front about the potential behavioral issues associated with your dog.This is essential to ensuring that you are getting a dog that is well-suited to your living situation. For instance, if you have young children, you will need a dog that has been socialized to deal with kids.
Even if a dog comes with some behavioral concerns, you may still choose to get it provided that you feel equipped to address those concerns with training. The important thing is that you are informed of potential issues in advance.

, Shelters and rescues should perform physical exams on the dogs that they receive. Make sure that there are medical records available for adopted dogs and that the staff are transparent about the health concerns associated with specific pets.If a dog has health issues, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't get it. However, you should be able to make an informed decision about whether or not you would like to assume the costs and effort related to the treatment of those issues.

, Reputable shelters and rescues will generally insist on a trial period with your new dog to ensure that the match is a good fit. Avoid facilities and groups that don’t give you at least a week’s window in which to return the dog."

Adopt the dog and bring it home!",How to Find and Adopt a Healthy and Happy Shelter Dog," This can be a pretty long list, as its just a starting point. It helps to know the sort of dog you are looking for before starting your search. Do a bit of research on each type of dog. What are its energy levels? What are its general personality characteristics? This information can help you narrow down what types of dogs might be right for you and your family. Ultimately, you also want the dog to be happy and fulfilled, which means providing it with the amount of exercise it needs, a good quality diet, and a social life.


Shelters are protective of their wards and will ask you to fill out a detailed questionnaire. This is not because they are nosy, but because they want to ensure a perfect match. Working on this list will help you narrow down your perfect match before you even go to the shelter.;
, This should narrow down your list of potential types of dogs. If your time is limited then don't choose a large dog or a breed that is renowned for needing a lot of exercise. Remember some small dogs, such as many of the terriers, originated as working dogs, which means they are able to run all day without tiring.


Bear in mind if you don't give the right amount of exercise the dog may become bored, which leads to destructive or antisocial behavior, or they may become overweight.

, This may seem obvious but if you live in a small apartment, be realistic about the size of the dog. Also, remember most dogs come with waggy tails, and in a small space the whip of a happy Labrador tail can do a lot of damage.

, There are a lot of expenses that come along with a dog. One expense that varies depending on the breed of dog you have is the cost of food. It is essential to buy a high quality food, and by default these are not the cheapest foods on the market. If you have a limited budget, don't adopt a large dog and economize by buying cheaper food. Instead, adopt a smaller dog and buy a good quality diet., Short-coated breeds require brushing at home, but long coated breeds need to be trimmed at a professional groomers regularly. Know how often your preferred breed of dog will need professional grooming and make sure this is realistic for your budget before taking the pet on.

, Preventative health care against fleas, worms, and heartworms is essential. Be aware most preventative treatments are bought by size, and the larger the dog the more expensive the medications. Be absolutely certain you can afford to regularly buy the right sized preventative for your proposed pet.

, Get a signed and dated letter from the landlord that they have agreed to you having a dog on the premises.Most reputable shelters will require you to have this if you don't own your home. This helps the shelter avoid getting returned or abandoned animals due to conflicts with landlords.


Investigate if you need separate insurance for any damage done to the property by the dog. Also investigate the cost of insurance policies should the dog hurt someone.

, What is your lifestyle? Do you have children? Some shelters will not home animals to those with kids under the age of five. Do you have other pets? This could influence the dogs you are allowed to choose from. Quite rightly many shelters won't home terrier breeds to a home with cats, as the terrier instinct is to chase cats.

, Those run by national organizations, such as the ASPCA or the Blue Cross, have excellent reputations. All the rescue pets are checked by a vet, and often neutered, vaccinated, dewormed, and microchipped prior to homing.Smaller shelters run by animal lovers may not have the resources to do this, and therefore the vet checks may not have been done before adoption.


If you run an internet search and find a smaller local shelter, then ask the shelter what checks are routinely done prior to homing. If a vet check has not taken place, ask what their policy is about accepting the dog back if you chose an animal, get it checked and discover there is a health issue.
Your vet may have a directory of breed-specific rescue shelters. If you have your heart set on a particular breed, contact your vet for details.You can also find many breed-specific shelters or rescue groups online. Look for groups in your area or in areas that you would be willing to travel to to find your perfect dog.

, You may want a small dog with curly hair and that loves kids. Or, you may want a young large breed puppy with a smooth coat. Whatever it is, there is a good chance they have it.

, Expect to fill out detailed registration documents before being allowed to see the dogs. This is to check you are a suitable owner, that you have adequate facilities to care for the dog, and that you meet the shelter's adoption criteria. For example, some require no young children, that you have access to a yard, or that you have no cats in the house.

, Unless you are an experienced dog owner and trainer who can work with behavior problems, look for a confident dog that doesn't growl or back away when you look into the kennel. Look for a dog that approaches you with curiosity, head up, ears pricked forward, standing tall, and tall wagging. These are all signs of a good natured dog who wants to say hello., If there are a few specific dogs you like, ask the workers at the shelter if you can take them one at a time into the playpen. This is your time to figure out whether one of the dogs is right for you.

, The best thing to do is ask the workers about any problems that you see. But, if you really, really like the dog, you may be able to have a vet exam it before adoption. A checklist for health includes:


Eyes: Should be bright, wide open, and free from sticky discharges.
Nose: No inflamed or flakey skin
Ears: Both ear canals look the same and there is no unpleasant smell, or discharge coming from the ears
Teeth: Should be clean, and there should be no angry red lines along the gum margin.
Coat: Glossy and tangle free. There should be no heavy flakes of dandruff, bald patches, scabs, or signs of the dog scratching heavily.
Legs: the dog should move freely without limping
Lungs: No coughing or sneezing, no difficulty breathing.
Demeanor: Is the dog lively and bright, or dull and depressed?
Ask the kennel staff is the dog has normal bowel movement or if he is prone to upset stomachs.
Inquire if the dog has a medical history, such as does he have a heart murmur, or he been on any treatment since arriving at the shelter.

, Make sure that the dog will suit your environment. Do you need a lively, active dog for fly ball and agility training? Do you need a sweet, mellow-natured dog that would be easy to train and likes frequent exercise? Or do you need a pup that a big fluffy coat because you live in a colder environment?

, Once you have found your ideal dog, be prepared to wait to take it home. Many shelters run 'home checks' to make sure the dog is indeed going into a suitable environment. If you pass this test, prepare for the dog.

, This includes a collar and leash, food and water bowls, food, a crate, a comfortable bed, and puppy pads if the dog is not house broken. You will also need to get grooming tools, vitamins, and toys as well.


Also read up on dog training methods using reward, since you want to start training your dog as soon as it gets home, by showing it where the toilet spot is and praising it for performing there., You will have to pay an adoption fee and sign paperwork before you take the dog home. This money goes to the shelter, so that they can feed and house more dogs in the future.


Let the dog sniff around the outside of your house or building before you bring it in. Try to get it to go to the bathroom outside right before you bring it in.
Slowly introduce your new dog to its new home. Once you bring it inside, let it explore a little but keep it supervised. Don't overwhelm it with attention if it is a shy dog. Instead give it time to adjust.

Even if you’re getting a dog to keep your other dog company, it will take significant time to train and socialize your second dog to their new environment. If you’re not ready to commit to a new dog in the short-term and for the long-haul, don’t get a second pooch.Remember that caring for two dogs will always mean significantly more (not equal or less) time and work than caring for one.;
, A simple logistical consideration when making your decision is: do you have enough room for another dog? If you live in a cramped urban apartment with no yard, the answer may well be “no.” Be sure that you have space for the additional crate and/or bedding plus plenty of room for both dogs to move around before you get a second dog.

, Remember that you're not only paying for the dog (which can have a hefty price tag itself) but also for supplies, food, vet bills, and any other necessary expenses. If you aren't sure you can afford it, don't take the risk of getting another dog.Generally, each dog will cost you a minimum of $500-$2,000 a year in food, supplies, and routine vet services, depending on where you live. That does not count any extra or emergency care like grooming, boarding, or emergency vet services., If you’ve recently undergone a lot of change in your life, such as getting a divorce or relocating to a new town, it might not be the best time to get a new dog. Major changes stress your dog out, so introducing a new dog during them can add to their woes. Wait until things have settled down again before you bring another pet into the mix., Think about whether other people in your family want another dog. Consider whether they will help you care for the pup or share the financial expenses. This is a big decision, so be sure to allow input from everyone in your household., Dogs are social creatures or “pack animals” who crave companionship. If you’re away from your dog more than you’re with them or if you leave them alone for long periods of time, they’re probably lonely and could use more consistent company. Getting a second dog may be a way to alleviate your pet’s loneliness., Just because dogs are social creatures doesn’t mean that they necessarily love the companionship of their fellow canines. They may only crave being with their humans. If your dog is habitually indifferent to, wary of, or aggressive towards other dogs, there is every reason to believe that they will act the same or worse towards a new dog in their house.If your pet is one of those dogs that prefers human company, getting another dog will likely only add to their anxiety instead of prevent it. If that’s the case, it’s best not to get a second dog. Instead, you might address their loneliness by asking a friend or relative to look in on them, hiring a dog walker, or taking them to daycare when you’re not around.Take time to notice which types and breeds of dogs that your pet is friendliest with. That will be a good tip-off as to which canines will make the best companions for your sociable dog.

, The better trained your dog is, the easier it will be to introduce a new pet into your home. Besides being able to moderate your first dog’s responses, their good behavior will set an example for your second one. Conversely, your current dog’s bad habits are likely rub off on the new dog, causing twice the trouble.If your dog exhibits undesirable behaviors, like barking, chewing, or aggression, address them through obedience training before you get another pooch.

, Besides being sociable, you want to consider the other elements of your pet’s personality, like their temperament and energy level. Assessing your current dog’s traits is essential to finding a compatible second dog.In terms of their energy level, does your dog have a high, medium, or low energy level? It’s best if you pick a second dog with similar levels. You may be able to pair a medium with a high or low, but it’s definitely not advisable to choose opposites.
In terms of their temperament, are they dominant or submissive, tolerant or excitable? If they tend to bossy with other dogs and protective of you, they’re probably on the dominant end of the spectrum. If they are slow to react to sudden movements and sounds and accept the attentions of other people and dogs, they’re more tolerant than excitable.

, You should also think about how a new dog will interact with other pets. You may have a cat, a bird, or a reptile in your home as well. Do your other pets get along with dogs? Could your pets hurt each other? Take the time to think about how a new addition will impact the pets you already have., Again, they’re going to be around another dog all the time, so it’s important that your new dog is friendly or at least willing to interact with fellow canines. If a dog seems to fearfully avoid other dogs altogether or aggressively invade their space, it will be much more difficult to socialize them to their new multi-dog home.Keep in mind that a certain amount of aggression between dogs is a normal part of their communication system and doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re anti-social. However, if a dog’s snaps and growls are constant and/or graduating into physical attacks, then you should be wary.

, Some breeds are known for being more dog-friendly than others. When you’re looking for a second pet, you might consider going for a type of dog that generally works well in a multi-dog homes.Some of the breeds that have been deemed fellow-canine-friendly include: Cocker Spaniels, Golden and Labrador Retrievers, German Shepherds, Poodles, Boxers, Basset Hounds, and Beagles.

, You don’t want a dog that’s identical to your other pet since that’s actually liable to cause conflicts. Instead, look for second dog that offers a compatible counterpoint to your current pet’s personality, age, and size.For example, if your dog is more of a dominant personality, it will be easier if you find a companion pet with a submissive one. Don’t pair your excitable dog with another jumpy pooch; try to find one that’s more tolerant so that they offset each other.
You probably don’t want two dogs of the exact same size or age since they may be more inclined towards aggression with one another. If they’re a different height, weight, and age, they’re less likely to feel competitive with one another.
However, if there’s too big of a gap in age and size, that can also be difficult. You don’t want a senior dog who is on their last legs paired with a puppy or a Chihuahua paired with a Saint Bernard who could accidentally hurt your lapdog through even the most innocent play.

, Dogs of opposite sexes tend to get along better and feel less competitive with one another, especially if both are neutered or spayed. If you already have a male, consider a female; if you have a female, consider getting a male., The best way to see if a second dog will be compatible with your first is to make a formal introduction. Take your current dog out on a ""parallel walk"" with the prospective new dog to see if they get along. You should take them to a “neutral zone” away from your property and keep both dogs on a leash with one person controlling each dog. On this equal footing, allow the two to meet each other, and then walk them side-by-side.Restrain a dog if they exhibit dangerously aggressive behavior, like lunging or biting. Otherwise, leave the leashes slack so that the dogs can easily interact with one another at will.
Be sure to praise both dogs consistently and equally as you go to put them at ease.
As another test, you can have both dogs sit at the same time and take turns giving each treats to see how they react. It’s best if they can both demonstrate self-control and attention to your commands even when they’re in each other's company.
If the dogs are consistently aggressive towards one another, they’re not a good match. A bit of nervousness or excitement is understandable, but be wary if one or both of them is unable to settle down or relax over the course of the walk.

, It’s always a good thing to have with any new pet, but it’s especially necessary when you’re getting a second dog. If no amount of thoughtful training can make them get along with your first pooch, you will won’t be able to keep them. Reputable breeders and shelters will offer you a return policy to ensure what’s best for the dog.

Dogs can be very cuddly, but keep in mind that not all dogs may love to snuggle.
If you are retired, work from home, or live by yourself, a dog can provide excitement and activity.
Remember that a dog needs companionship too. If you work long hours, travel frequently, or are otherwise unable to care for the dog during the day, you may not want to adopt a dog.;
, Think about whether or not you need a dog to perform certain tasks or to assist around the home. Dogs can provide therapeutic aid, round up livestock, or guard the home. If you think that a dog can help you, you may want to consider whether or not adopting a work dog is right for you.


If you have livestock, you may want a guard dog to protect the animals from predators. Some dogs, such as Australian Cattle Dogs or Border Collies, can be trained to herd animals as well.
Dogs can be used to guard your home. Just having a dog in the house is enough to scare away potential intruders.If you are looking for a guide or therapy dog, you may be limited to certain breeds, such as a Labrador Retriever, German Shepherd, or Golden Retriever.These dogs will require training to effectively work and care for you.

, Dogs require plenty of exercise, and they can help keep you active. You might want a dog to help keep you active or to join you during outdoor activities.Some great activities you can do with dogs include:


Running
Hiking
Swimming
Playing games like tug-of-war or fetch

, If you have children, you can use the dog to help teach them about responsibility. Your children may learn about caring for an animal as they feed, wash, and train the dog.Do not adopt a dog thinking that it will stop fighting or resolve relationship problems in a tense situation. A dog may only add stress to the situation.

, If you have other pets already, a new dog in the house may be a good addition, giving them a lifelong companion that they can play with when the humans are away. That said, some cats and dogs may not be comfortable with a new animal in the house. Consider how your current pets might feel about having a new dog in the house.


Many people will adopt a dog to provide an older dog with companionship. This is a good idea if you want to keep the older dog alert and active.If your current pet has demonstrated aggression towards dogs in the past, adopting a dog as a companion may not be a good idea.
If your current dog has a high prey drive, you may not want to adopt a smaller dog.

, It is generally not a good idea to give a dog as a gift to someone unless you have discussed with them beforehand their willingness and ability to care for the dog. While you might think it is a great gift, remember that dogs can be expensive and they require quite a bit of time and energy. The recipient may not want a dog, and giving them an unwanted pet puts them in a difficult decision if they cannot appropriately care for one., Dogs are living creatures, and you should not buy a dog to impress or scare other people. Furthermore, be cautious when adopting a purebred dog. While some purebred dogs are often chosen for their physical appearance, these dogs may be severely inbred, leading to respiratory and hip problems.While some small dogs may be comfortable being carried in a purse, others might be anxious or scared by the experience.
Certain breeds such as pit bulls or rottweilers are often used to intimidate or scare people. While these dogs are effective guard dogs, they should not be trained to be aggressive or to attack people.

Pick a specialized breeder.,
Do a site visit.,
Ask questions of the breeder to establish their expertise.,
View the puppy with one or both of their parents.,
Verify the dogs’ registrations.,
Ensure that your pup’s parents are healthy.,
Insist on a sales contract.",How to Determine Where to Get Your Dog3," Responsible breeders will dedicate their operations to one or two breeds at most since breeding requires extensive experience and expertise with a particular breed. Avoid breeders that offer multiple types of dogs.The clubs associated with various breeds will often have lists of breeders available on their websites. Most clubs require featured breeders to sign on to a rigorous code of ethics to ensure humane practices and protect the future of the breed.
The American Kennel Club hosts a list of all the breeders referred by specific clubs., Going to the place where the puppy has been born and raised is essential to ensuring that they’ve been treated to a high standard of care. Check that the living conditions for all the dogs are humane and sanitary.All dogs on site should have clean living facilities, free from waste and dirt. They should have access to fresh water and a play area. Be wary if dogs are kept in cramped, dark, or unclean quarters or if they’re lethargic and unresponsive.
Remember, reputable breeders will never sell their litters through a pet store; they’ll insist on screening their buyers directly. If they’re not willing to meet with you on their premises, do not do business with them.

, Doing a site visit will also give you a sense of how well-versed a breeder is in their business. The breeders should come off as knowledgeable about their breed and helpful about their care.Make queries such as, “How much exercise will this dog need?”, “What is the best food and feeding routine for this breed?”, “How would you recommending training them?”, and, “What possible health problems might this dog develop?”

, Healthy puppies come from healthy, well-treated parents. Besides verifying that the puppies are being raised in good conditions, make sure their mother and father have enjoyed a high level of care and contributed to your puppy’s development and socialization., Reputable breeders will generally register their litters with the American Kennel Club to confirm their lineage. The puppies will come will papers that verify that their sire and dam are officially registered. This does not guarantee that your puppy will be healthy; it only establishes that they have come from a purebred line.If you intend to show your dog, it’s important that their parents and their litter are AKC-registered.

, Purebred dogs are susceptible to genetic ailments. Responsible breeders will protect the breed, their puppies, and their customers by having the sire and dam of each litter checked for the hereditary diseases and disorders that are most common to their breed (like hip dysplasia or macular degeneration).Do not purchase a dog unless the breeder has had independently certified genetic health screenings for your pup’s parents that are available in the Canine Health Information Center Database. The dam’s and sire’s health records should be searchable and include evaluations of any defects that could be passed along to your puppy.
The breeder should also include a health guarantee for your puppy that stipulates that you can return the dog if a vet should find they have any significant hereditary health issues.

, Responsible breeders will put your sales agreement for a puppy in writing and provide guarantees associated with its sale.Besides agreeing on the price, these documents should provide a health guarantee to the buyers. It should include a return policy that will give you a full refund should a vet identify any significant health issues within a given timeframe, from a week to a year.
Most reputable breeders will also include a stipulation that insists that a dog be returned to them if the owners should ever find themselves unable to care for it.

Analyze your lifestyle.,
Assess your living space.,
Factor in the cost of a dog.,
Look over your schedule.,
Determine if you can fulfill their needs.",How to Evaluate Your Reasons for Wanting a Dog2," Whether or not you have children, how much you exercise, and how often you’re home can help determine whether or not a dog is right for you. Think about your lifestyle, and consider all of the ways that a new dog will fit into that lifestyle.If you like to go out on weekends or travel frequently, a dog may not be right for you. Remember that you will have to ensure that the dog is taken care of while you are out of the house.
If you have young children under the age of six, you may want to wait a few years before getting a dog, as many dogs may not do well around small children.
If you already own one pet, consider how that pet acts around other animals and dogs. Will your pet appreciate a new friend? Or will they become territorial?

, When you adopt a dog, your home becomes their home too. Some dogs do well in apartments while others need homes with fenced-in yards. Some might be hardy enough to live outdoors while some can only survive indoors. Decide how much space the dog would have to roam, whether or not they’d have a yard, and where you would store a dog crate, food, beds, and toys.


If you are renting, you will have to check your lease to make sure that dogs are permitted on the property. There may be size and breed restrictions as well., Dogs are expensive. A dog can easily cost over $1000 to care for in the first year and $500 every year after.Make sure you can afford a dog before you bring one into your home. Things you may have to pay for include:


Food
Water bowl
Leash
Collar
Microchipping
Toys
Treats
Spaying or neutering
Vet visits
Emergency treatment
Medication
Dog-sitter or boarding

, Dogs need to socialize with people and other animals. Not enough activity means that they will become bored, destructive, or anxious.Make sure that you will have enough time to spend with your dog each day, not just to take care of basic necessities like walks and feedings but also to play, cuddle, and socialize with your pet.


If you work long days, remember that the dog would be alone at your house. Dogs need regular stimulation, such as walks, as well as social activities and toilet breaks outside. If the dog is a puppy or incontinent senior, you may need to hire a dog sitter or walker who will visit them during the day., To understand how strong your desire or reasons are for a dog, test your commitment to caring for one. Determine if you are capable and willing to fulfill all of their needs, even when you are feeling tired, sick, or lazy.You can ask yourself:


Am I committed to training the dog?
Will I be available to feed and walk the dog every day, rain or shine?
Do I mind cleaning up dog poop while housetraining the dog?
Do I own valuable items that might be destroyed by the dog?
Do I mind dog hair on my rugs, furniture, and clothing?
Will I bathe the dog when needed?
Am I able to spend time with the dog every day? Am I willing to skip social events or vacations to care for the dog?

Create a pros and cons list.,
Ask your friends and family for their opinions.,
Talk to a rescue organization.,
Volunteer at a shelter.,
Dog sit for a friend.,
Weigh your reasons for wanting a dog.,
Give yourself time to make an informed decision.",How to Evaluate Your Reasons for Wanting a Dog3," Create a list with two columns. Under one column, write down all of the benefits and good reasons to own a dog. Under the other column, write down all of the negative consequences and restraints of owning a dog. If the cons outweigh the pros, a dog may not be right for you.

, Talking to another person can be a great way to understand if your reasons are good enough for adopting a dog. Your friends and family will understand your living situation and lifestyle, and they can help you understand whether adopting a dog is a good idea or not. They may even provide reasons that you did not consider before.

, If you’re still uncertain about your reasons or ability to own a dog, contact a local rescue organization. This might be one that you are interested in adopting from or one that specializes in a breed that you want. They are experienced with dog owners. Tell them your reasons for wanting a dog, and they will be able to tell you if a dog is the right choice for you.

, If you’ve never owned a dog before, you may be uncertain still about what owning a dog entails. Find your local animal shelter, Humane Society, or Society for the Protection and Care of Animals. Ask them if you can help care for dogs. Not only will this let you interact with potential adoptees, but you will have an opportunity to feed, walk, play, and clean up after dogs., If you have friends who own dogs, you might ask one of them if you can borrow the dog for a day or two to see how well you fare with owning a dog. Feed the dog, take them outside to eliminate, groom them, and play with them. This will give you a picture of what your daily life with a dog will be like. If you still want a dog, you may be ready to own one after all., Once you have both evaluated your arguments for wanting a dog and your ability to own a dog, you should compare the two together. Ideally, you should not adopt a dog unless you are completely committed and capable of caring for a dog.


If you have good reasons to own a dog but you cannot provide them a good home, perhaps you should look into a different type of pet, such as a cat, guinea pig, or reptile.
If you’re not sure about your reasons but you can provide the dog a good home, you might spend some more time thinking about your commitment of caring for a pet.
If your reasons are sound and you can provide a good home, a dog may be the right choice for you.
If you have tried volunteering or dogsitting for a while and you still want a pet, your reasons for wanting a dog may be strong enough.

, It can be tempting to adopt a dog on impulse. Perhaps you saw a puppy in a window, or maybe you went to an adoption event ""just to see."" If you have not seriously considered your reasons for adopting a dog before, give yourself some time before you go through with the adoption. Time will allow you to rationally consider your reasons, and you may be able to arrive at a more sensible conclusion.

Determine your activity level.,
Make sure you have enough living space.,
Assess your work and social life.",How to Decide Whether to Get a German Shepherd1," German shepherds are athletic dogs with high levels of energy. They enjoy running around, and they need exercise in order to stay healthy. Without exercise, German shepherds can become frustrated and potentially destructive.German shepherds need at least 30 minutes of rigorous exercise daily. Rigorous exercise includes running, jumping hurdles, chasing balls, and playing fetch.
If you cannot provide the adequate amount of exercise, reconsider getting a German shepherd.;
, German shepherds require a living space that is stable, as well as large. Therefore, if you live in an apartment, particularly a small apartment, your living quarters might be too small to host a German shepherd. Ideally, a German shepherd needs a home setting with a large, fenced-in backyard.If you live in an apartment, you will also need to consider if your neighbors will tolerate a loud, barking dog since German shepherds tend to bark a lot.

, If your work and/or social life prevent you from being home most of the time, this will be problematic. German shepherds need constant companionship and care. Therefore, being ok with sacrificing weekends to stay home with your German shepherd is a necessity.If your work requires that you travel a lot, reconsider getting a German shepherd. You cannot and should not leave these dogs at home for extended periods.

Research the appropriate food dish for your dog.,
Select a dog collar.,
Choose the right bedding for your dog.,
Be informed about your dog food choices.,
Talk to your veterinarian about vaccines.",How to Educate Yourself As a New Dog Owner1," It is important to select the right type of food dish for your dog to ensure that it is able to safely and successfully reach its food. Provide a bowl that is the right depth for your dog so that it will not injure itself or strain its neck. Having a comfortable dish help to reduce stress and ease the transition for both you and the dog.


A puppy or a dog with a stout nose, like a bulldog or a boxer, may need a shallow dish to reach its food to avoid straining its neck, while a dog with floppy ears may need a deeper dish to keep its ears clean and out of the way.
Be sure to wash your dog’s bowl frequently as bacteria can build up inside the dish.;
, It is important to pick the right collar for your dog’s size and that it fits comfortably and securely.The collar should not restrict your dog’s neck, but it shouldn’t be so loose that your dog can slip out of it. Make sure you are able to fit two fingers between the collar and your dog’s neck.Collars for small dogs should be between 11 and 15 inches in length, while a collar for a medium dog should be between 15 and 20 inches. Large dogs will need a collar that is between 19 and 30 inches.Be sure to frequently adjust the size of your puppy’s collar. Puppies grow quickly, so it is important to make sure that the collar is comfortable and secure.A standard, flat collar works well for most dogs. This collar is typically made of nylon or leather and is equipped with a side-release buckle.Martingale collars are better options for dogs with narrow heads, like the greyhound or a whippet, or for a dog who often slips out of its collar. This collar has two metal rings at each end. The collar tightens if a dog pulls while on the leash, preventing the dog from slipping out of the collar.Back-clip harnesses are recommended for short-nosed or small dogs that are prone to tracheal collapse, such as a Boston terrier or a pug. This harness clips on your dog’s back, alleviating the pressure on your dog’s neck., Visit your local pet shop and talk to an expert to select the appropriate bedding for your dog. A dog bed should be large enough so that your dog can lie comfortably in all natural positions. If your dog likes to curl up while sleeping, an oval bed with raised sides may be a great option. A flat, rectangular bed may be perfect for a dog that likes to lie flat while resting.Senior dogs or dogs that suffer from joint problems may benefit from an orthopedic or memory-foam bed.
An elevated cot may be a great option for dogs with long, thick coats that overheat while sleeping. , Feeding your dog a well-balanced and nutritional diet is important for the dog’s health and well-being. Carefully read the dog food label before you buy a product. Food labels are required to list ingredients by weight, so look for dog food that lists animal protein such as beef, chicken, or lamb as its first ingredient. Search for other familiar, wholesome ingredients on the label to ensure that your dog will be receiving a high-quality diet with minimal fillers and preservatives.


Ensure that your dog’s food has essential fatty acids such as lard, tallow, and poultry fat. Fats provide your dog with energy and soluble nutrients, make the food more appetizing, and help support a healthy coat.An ingredient that is not familiar to you is most likely a filler or a preservative. These rapidly move through your dog’s digestive system and do not provide your dog with adequate nutrients or energy.

, Discuss how often you should bring your dog in for a check-up, and be sure that your dog receives its necessary vaccinations for rabies, hepatitis, parvovirus, and canine distemper. Consult your veterinarian to see what vaccinations are required and recommended, and work together to determine the vaccination schedule.


Ask the veterinarian if your particular breed is prone to any health issues. Medium-sized breeds like border collies can develop bone or joint issues such as hip dysplasia.Hip dysplasia and osteoarthritis can be aggravated by poor diet and inadequate exercise. Ask your veterinarian about providing the correct nutrition and exercise to help prevent future health issues.

Pick a dog for your lifestyle.,
Meet with some adoptable dogs.",How to Decide if You Want a Dog," A dog is going to need a safe indoor space that has room for it to live happily. Additionally, it should have access to an outdoor space such as a yard or park nearby for relief as well as for exercise and play.If you rent your home, make sure your landlord is ok with you having a dog before you adopt. Get a rider to your lease saying it’s ok for you to have a pet, if possible, and be prepared to pay a pet deposit.
Think about the type of breed you want. Different breeds require different spaces. Generally speaking, larger dogs will need more space overall, and sporting or hunting breeds tend to like consistent access to outdoor spaces.
Make sure the dog has an indoor space. Chaining your dog outdoors exposes them to a number of environmental dangers. If you are considering a dog that would spend most of its time outdoors, still make sure you have a designated indoor space for when you are not home, for the nights, and for inclement weather.;
, Consider what is most important to you right now. Do you work long hours? Do you like spending most nights out? Are you planning on making any major life changes such as moving or expanding your family any time soon.Consider whether your life has room in for the needs and responsibilities that come with a dog.
Think about whether you want a dog for occasional companionship or if you are looking for a lifelong companion animal. If you are only looking for occasional companionship, a dog might not be right for you.

, Along with lifelong costs, getting a dog comes with some initial overhead. You will either have to pay an adoption fee or the often expensive breeder fee to take the dog home. In addition, you will also have to pay for initial supplies for the dog such as food, dishes, a bed, a crate, toys, vaccines, spaying or neutering, obedience training, and more.


The overall cost of owning a dog in the first year depends greatly on the dog and its specific needs, but often ranges well over $1,000.If you do not have the money to handle the initial cost of adoption at the time you want to adopt, consider postponing getting a pet until you can fully afford it.

, Before you bring a dog into your home, talk to the other members of your household to make sure they are prepared for the new pet. Allow them the chance to raise any concerns and have an open, honest discussion about the subject.


If you have roommates, discuss what their responsibilities would be with the dog. Would they help care for it, or would you be the primary owner and caregiver?
Work out responsibilities with your family. Would your children help take care of the dog? Who would fulfill what duties when it comes to caring for the pet?

, A dog requires daily attention, regular affection, and regular care. Consider whether you have the time and will to properly take care of a dog, including daily walks, feeding, and playtime as well as providing regular vet checks and other care as necessary.If you away from home for long hours, or if purchasing pet care such as food and vet checks would be a substantial burden, you may not be able to properly care for a dog at this moment.
If you have any doubts about whether you can handle the responsibilities of having a dog, put off adoption until you able to better assess your needs and make sure you can care for a pet.

, Think about the type of dog you want and whether you can handle problems often associated with that breed. Small dogs, for example, are often prone to problems like arthritis, which can lead to mobility challenges and increased vet bills as the dog ages.Look online, read breed guides, and talk to other dog owners about the lifelong needs of their pet to get a better idea of what type of commitment you could be making.
Consider whether you will be able to afford products such as specialty foods, regular vet checks, and medication as your dog ages.
Further remember that most dogs will live 10 to 13 years. Consider whether you have a long term life plan that will allow you to keep a dog for one to two decades., All dogs need some physical exercise. Consider whether you are able to give this, and to what degree. The level of activity to which you can commit helps you decide not only if you want a dog but what type of dog is right for you.Sporting, herding, and working breeds will often require more exercise, and will need long walks multiple times a day.
Smaller breeds such as toy dogs and terriers will still need frequent exercise, but can generally be taken for shorter walks.
Regardless of breed, expect to walk the dog at least twice a day every day. If you cannot commit to that, a dog may not be right for you., If you are considering getting a dog, think about whether you want to buy a dog from a breeder or adopt. Adopting from an animal shelter provides a dog with a second chance at finding a loving, caring home.Contact local pet shelters to see what dogs they have available and to arrange a time for you to come down and meet with potential pets.
If you choose to purchase a pet from a breeder, check their client testimony and with breeding associations to ensure they are an ethical, reputable breeder committed to breeding healthy dogs in nurturing conditions.

, Think about what type of dog best fits your activity level and lifestyle. Consider factors such as how much room you have to give, whether your home life is more quiet or social, and how physically active you are on a regular basis.Use breed guides, online breed specific resources, and knowledgeable workers at your local animal shelter or pet store to help you figure out what breeds have personality traits that coincide with your lifestyle.
If you’re considering adoption, try not to limit yourself to just one breed, as shelters may not have a dog of that breed. Instead, pick a few breeds that may work for you. Alternatively, see if there is a specific breed rescue in your area.
Do not think that you need a dog that is purebred or a single breed. Mutts are often healthy and lovable dogs with their own, distinct personalities.

, Think about your lifestyle and consider what type of dog would best fit your day to day life. Do you want a dog that is high or low energy? Are you looking for a dog for security or companionship?


Breeds such as bulldogs, spaniels, havanese, greyhounds, and schipperkes are all dogs that require mental challenge more than physical challenge, and so are good for small spaces such as apartments as well as lower energy homes.Border collies, shepherds, huskies, and Rhodesian ridgebacks are all high energy dogs that can run for miles if you are looking for a workout buddy.If you’re looking for a companion, try breeds like retrievers, schnauzers, and poodles, while dogs like shepherds provide good security along with companionship., One of the best ways for you to get a feel for a dog’s personality is to meet with it. Talk to your local shelter or, if you do not have a local shelter, breeder about setting up a time to come visit available dogs and see if one is the right fit for you.Know that dogs in shelters or large, changing groups may be shy or more rowdy than they will be at home. These dogs are frequently approached by strangers have their groups broken apart, so develop their own means of coping with that stress.
Plan to take 20 to 30 minutes with each dog you want to meet. This gives you time to get past initial curiosity and start truly interacting with the dog.
Ask the shelter dogs which ones are their favorites and why to help get a sense of what the dog is like with people around whom it is comfortable.

Find a reliable source like a Canine Encyclopedia or breeder’s guide in order to learn more about the dog’s demeanor and activity.


If you still have questions after your research, consult a dog breeder or shelter employee for detailed and specific answers.;
, Check city and residential policies to ensure that you won’t run into any technical snags once you adopt your pit.Even if your city and state technically permit pit bulls, be aware that many residential complexes have special guidelines prohibiting the breed in particular. Even if you find a rental complex which permits your pit bull, you should be prepared to pay more in deposits or pet fees., In fact, the pit bull is bred to be aggressive with other animals—and, in particular, other dogs—but not with humans.So, unless you’re worried about your home coming under attack from a pack of wild dogs, a pit bull probably isn’t your best option for a guard dog.


If you’re looking for a guard dog, you’ll want to pick a breed that is fiercely territorial, such as a German Shepherd or a Doberman Pinscher., Warranted or not, pit bulls are widely considered dangerous and aggressive. So, keep in mind that taking a pit into your home will mean dealing with people’s preconceptions and prejudices regarding your dog.


Be prepared to field criticism from neighbors and friends alike. Widely-publicized pit bull attacks mean that many people have only heard bad things about your precious pit.A smiling, perfectly-trained pit bull is the best way to combat their prejudice.
As a practical consideration, homeowners insurance might specifically exclude pit bulls from their coverage, so double-check any insurance policies you have before taking the pit bull plunge., Pit bulls are a highly energetic breed, thus they require lots of exercise on a daily basis.You’ll need to allot at least an hour of your day to walking, jogging or playing with your pit bull. Expect this demand on your time to continue throughout your pet’s life: unlike some other large breeds, pit bulls remain energetic long after puppyhood and require plenty of mentally- and physically-stimulating activities., You wouldn’t invite another person into your home on a permanent basis without evaluating your living conditions first, and adopting a dog—especially one so large and powerful as the pit bull—warrants just the same amount of consideration.


If you have a single-family home with a yard, that’s a bonus. Remember, though, that you’ll need to install a large, sturdy fence to keep this athletic and intelligent creature in bounds.
Even large dogs like pit bulls can be good city- and apartment-dwellers.In the event that you live in an apartment, though, you’ll need to factor in more exercise and outdoor time. You should expect to take at least four long walks a day, in addition to playing indoors with games like tug-of-war., Pit bulls are highly social animals, so you’ll need to think about your own habits and consider whether or not they’re compatible with a pit bull.


Exercise isn’t the only time consideration you’ll need to make. Pit bulls do not like being left alone for long periods of time, so, in order to be a good pit bull owner, you should guarantee that your work day is consistent and not overly long or demanding of travel.Don’t count on a dog day care to compensate for your absence. Since pit bulls are often aggressive with other dogs, they don’t mesh well with highly social environments like boarding facilities., Since pit bulls are large and boisterous, you should carefully consider every person or animal with which the dog is likely to come into contact.


If you have elderly individuals or very small children in the house, you will probably want to consider a different breed. Pit bulls are unlikely to harm a person deliberately, but their rowdy behavior can be hazardous to fragile individuals.Think carefully about introducing a pit bull if there are already other dogs in the home. Despite their love of people, pits were bred as fighting dogs, thus they are often difficult to socialize with other members of their species., Whether you pick up a puppy or adult dog, you should be prepared to pay for the initial neuter or spay. At a shelter, this cost can run as low as $50.00, but a private veterinarian can charge as much as $300.00.


Don’t forget that you’ll also need to schedule an initial check-up with your local veterinarian. Expect charges for rabies and distemper vaccinations, as well as flea and heartworm medications.

, Just like humans, pit bulls can suffer from various ailments throughout their lifetimes, so you should be prepared to spend some of your income on your pet’s health.


Regular check-ups and shots are necessary to keep your dog disease- and parasite-free.
Pit bulls are, like many other large dog breeds, prone to hip dysplasia. This hip condition can be a major pain for both your dog and your wallet: treatments can run as high as $20,000.00 over the course of a lifetime., Medical plans can help you avoid incurring significant charges in the event of a serious malady, but they’ll cost you between $40.00 and $60.00 a month., Since the pit bull is so commonly maligned, you’ll need to take special care to ensure his behavior is beyond reproach.


You should seriously consider registering for a dog training class or attending a one-on-one session with a dog behavior specialist. The benefits of professional training are manifold: not only is the course likely to be more effective, but it can also help socialize your pit bull with other dogs in a safe, monitored environment.If you prefer to train your dog at home, you should still purchase some professionally-sourced training manuals and implements to assist your efforts. You will need general supplies like a leash, collar, and crate, as well as pit bull-specific provisions like break sticks, tools which are placed into the mouth of a pit bull in order to force the dog to release its grip., A pit bull can weigh anywhere between 30 and 85 pounds, so be prepared for a substantial monthly food bill.


Pit bulls should be fed twice a day in portions between 3/4 and 1.5 cups at a time.Depending on the brand and type of food you plan on giving your pet, count on spending between $20.00 and $50.00 every month on your pit bull’s food., Though pit bulls have short coats, you should plan on taking your dog to a professional groomer. A professional groomer can check your pet’s coat and skin condition for parasite activity, rashes, dryness, or other signs of irritation.


Expect a trip to the groomer to cost between $30.00 and $90.00.The groomer determines price according to size and coat condition, so they will have a breed-specific price-list available.Call your local groomer for an exact quote.

See if you can afford training.,
Take health issues into consideration.,
Think about the size of the dog.",How to Decide Whether to Get a German Shepherd2," Training will be one of the most important responsibilities you will have as an owner of a German shepherd. You will need to begin obedience training as soon as your German shepherd can train, i.e., around eight weeks, and continue this training throughout its adult life. Training, along with proper socialization, is essential to ensure that your German shepherd is well behaved.Obedience training classes range from $50 to $125 dollars for a four to eight week class.Take your dog to the dog park weekly to ensure proper socialization., German shepherds have a large number of health issues ranging from allergies to more life-threatening diseases, such as degenerative myelopathy. This means that you will need to take your dog to the vet regularly, i.e. at least once a year. You will also need to bring your dog to the vet if and when any of these health issues arises., Adult female dogs will reach a weight of 60 to 80 pounds, and adult male dogs will reach a weight of 70 to 90 pounds. Also, because they grow relatively quickly, a German shepherd puppy’s diet needs to be closely regulated in order to avoid potential health problems. And, because they have two coats, German shepherds shed a lot and require constant grooming, such as brushing.On average, a German shepherd will cost $3,000 per year in food, grooming, and vet care."

If you and your guardian can't agree on a dog, make a compromise.",How to Convince Your Guardian to Get a Dog," Is somebody in your family allergic? Do you live in a tiny apartment unsuitable for a canine to live in? Is Rover too much money? There are many problems that may arise, but that's okay, because they're fixable.;
, There are many hypo-allergenic dogs out there that you can get. Research where you can find hypo-allergic dogs in your area and go visit them. Bring along the person in your family that is allergic to them, so that you can see if they have an allergic reaction or not. If they don't, great! If they do, keep looking for other kinds of hypo-allergenic dogs.

, If you live in an apartment, you can't get a huge German Shepherd. You'll have to settle for a small dog such as a Yorkie. Since your home doesn't have a lot of space, you'll need to make sure that you take the dog out for at least two walks a day, so that it can get its energy out. If you can't commit to going out with your dog that much, you may need to settle for another pet, such as a kitten.

, If this is the case, sadly, you're pretty much stuck. However, you can still get the dog owner experience...with someone else's dog. If you know an elderly person with a dog or someone without the time or energy to play with their dog or take their dog for a walk, ask them if you can come over a few times a week and play with their dog. The dog owner will most likely say yes, because they'll love the fact that their dog can get exercise without them lifting a finger.

, You've seen those pet store prices, and they're high. However, you can save a little money on the initial purchase of the dog by going to your local animal shelter/rescue group. There are many great dogs there that need a great home like yours. There are even some pure-breeds there! Because these animals need to be adopted, the prices for them are several hundred dollars lower than those pricy pet stores. However, be warned that you'll need to pay for more than just the dog. You'll also need to buy its food, toys, leash, vet bills, etc., which can rack up to a large sum of money. If you and your guardian decide that your financial situation isn't suitable for a dog at the moment, you might just have to wait a few years until you can afford a dog. Sometimes patience is rewarded! If your guardian decides that getting a shelter dog would be a good choice for your family, congratulations! You'll get that pooch of your dreams while being a dog-saver!

, Do extra chores around the house. Look after your neighbor's pets while they're away on vacation. This will teach you a lot about animal care. Look after your younger siblings/family members to show your guardian that you're responsible enough for a dog. Don't whine, cry, beg, blackmail, or bribe them to get you a dog. This shows a huge lack of maturity, and will actually decrease your chances of getting a dog. Write your parents a letter or make up a contract saying that you'll be fully responsible for the dog and that you'll take care of it. This shows that you're serious about getting a dog.

, Do you want a Saint Bernard, but your guardian wants a Chihuahua? Or vice versa? Make a compromise and decide on a medium-sized dog, such as a Beagle. Do you want an energetic dog that wants to play all day, but your guardian wants a lazy lap dog? Decide on a dog that's ready to play when you are, but can also be able to calm down and sit on your lap.

Accommodate your dog’s energy level.,
Socialize your dog.,
Remove environmental hazards from your home.",How to Educate Yourself As a New Dog Owner2," All dogs have varying energy levels and require exercise, but some breeds require more activity and exertion than others. Be sure to provide adequate exercise and rest for your dog to keep it happy and healthy. A high-energy, athletic dog may need to go on frequent walks and spend a lot of time running in a field or park. A low-energy dog may be content to go on a short walk and spend the rest of the day lounging around your home.


If you have a high-energy dog, consider taking it on daily runs or schedule the time to take it to a dog park several times a week.
Don’t overexert a senior dog or a low-energy dog. If your dog tries to stop, is panting loudly, or has an uneven gait, this is an indication that it has reached its limits., If you work long hours at the office or juggle other activities and projects outside the home, this may impact the well-being of your new dog. Dogs are social pack animals, and they usually thrive being surrounded by other dogs or people. Some dogs feel more vulnerable when left alone, and while others become bored and destructive.If you are away for long stretches each day, consider hiring a dog walker or look into pet daycare options in your area.


Some rescue dogs can have separation anxiety when left alone. This can be an effect of the stress and anxiety they may have experience while in a shelter. If you adopting a dog from a shelter, ask an employee about the experiences your dog has been through and how it fairs with being on its own.

, Your home, both inside and outside, should be a safe environment for your dog. Exam your home and look out for any potential dangers or hazardous materials that can threatened your dog’s health and safety. Be sure that medications, cleaning agents, and poisonous plants are removed and are not easily accessible to your dog.


If you have plants in your home, be sure that they are not poisonous to your pet. Common indoor plants such as dieffenbachia, azalea, Calla lily, and philodendron can be toxic to your dog. Remove any toxic plants from your home or be sure they are out of reach.Put away toxic chemicals such as detergents, insecticides, antifreeze, weed-killer, and other chemically harsh products. Ingesting these chemicals can be harmful and fatal to dogs.Tie up electrical cords to prevent your dog or puppy from chewing on them.
If you have a cat, keep its litter box away from your dog. Dogs may ingest the litter or cat feces, which can cause gastrointestinal obstructions or intestinal worms."

Allow your dog to adjust to its surroundings.,
Don’t crowd your pet with several new people.,
Make an at-home schedule.",How to Educate Yourself As a New Dog Owner3," Moving from a foster home or a shelter to another new environment can be a stressful situation for dogs. Know that your dog will need time to adjust to its new home. A new puppy may miss its mother, and an older dog may be wary or nervous by the change. Show your dog where its water, bed, and toys are, and then allow it to explore the area on its own.

, Welcoming your new dog into the family is an exciting time, but be sure to make introductions slowly. Your dog may feel in danger if there are several new people around crowding it, trying to pet it, and vying for its attention. Ask everyone to be calm and take turns getting acquainted with the new addition., Create a schedule and routine for your new dog, and share it with members of your family. Decide how often to feed your dog, how and when to exercise it, and how often it will be cleaned and groomed.Creating and sticking to a schedule will help remind you of your responsibilities to your dog, and it will allow you to plan ahead and adjust for any conflicts well in advance.


If members of your family are going to help care for the dog, consider assigning specific duties to each person so that everyone is included in the care of your new pet.

Ask your family members how they feel about German shepherds.,
Decide where the dog will live.,
Determine if you can be a leader.",How to Decide Whether to Get a German Shepherd3," If you have a family, partner, or people living with you, you must consider their opinions about owning a German shepherd before purchasing one. If other family members rather have another breed of dog, then reconsider getting a German shepherd.You also need to be sure that your partner or family members are comfortable with handling a German shepherd on their own when you are away.

, If you plan to keep the dog outside in the backyard most of the time, then reconsider your decision to get a German shepherd. German shepherds need constant companionship, not only for socialization purposes, but also because companionship is a natural part of their personality.If you are bothered by a dog that will follow you everywhere, then perhaps a German shepherd is not for you.

, German shepherds, like most dogs, are pack dogs. Therefore, early on, you need to establish your leadership. If you cannot provide calm, confident, and strong leadership for your dog, then they will take things on for themselves. This will make them very hard to control.A confident leader is not someone who is loud, harsh, or demanding, but is someone who is mature, firm, and fair in all areas of treatment of the dog.

For example, are you or someone else in your family home often enough to care for a dog? Deciding to adopt a dog, whatever type of dog you pick, requires you to have the time to take care of it properly, including feeding it, giving it exercise, and having enough time to spend with it.All dogs require love and attention. Some dogs do require more attention than others, but with any dog you cannot be absent most of the time.
If you don't have the time to spend with a dog, for instance you travel often for work and live alone, consider adopting a more independent pet, such as a cat.;
, If you decide that you can care for a dog, then your next step is to figure out what type of dog will fit best into your life. There are dog breeds to fit a wide variety of lifestyles, so you just need to figure out your best match. In order to do this, you need to be honest about your lifestyle and research breeds based on your requirements.


Do you like outdoor activities or do you like to stay in the city? An active breed, such as a Labrador retriever, will do great on weekly hikes, while a toy breed, like a Chihuahua, will probably have a hard time with vigorous hikes.
Do you exercise outside regularly or are you a couch potato? These are questions that you need to answer honestly in order to find a dog that will adjust easily to your lifestyle. For example, if you love to exercise and you end up with an English bulldog, who does not need or want vigorous exercise, then you may end up with incompatibility problems.

, Unless you are a family of one, you need to take the needs and personalities of the other people in your family into consideration when getting a dog. Debating what type of dog you all want, and coming to an agreement, will make the dog's transition into your home easier for everyone, the dog included.


Do you have young kids in the house? If so, be sure to choose a breed that generally gets along well with children.There are many popular breeds, such as the Labrador retriever and the golden retriever, that do wonderfully with children., Your home should also impact your choice of dog. Are you living in a rural or in an urban setting? Are you in a tiny apartment or a large house? The size of your home and the space around it will dictate what kind of dog you should get. In general, a small living space is good for a small dog but a large dog requires a large living space.


For example, a Chihuahua or Yorkshire terrier may love your one-bedroom apartment, but larger breeds, such as boxers and Great Danes, need more room to roam.
If you are living rurally and have lots of room for a dog to roam, consider breeds that love to run and respond well to training, so that you can let it run but it will come back to you every time. These include herding dogs, such as the Australian shepherd, and guard dogs, like the German shepherd.If you have a family that likes to travel, think about what dog breeds can go with you and adjust easily to new situations. Depending on the specific dog, good family dog breeds, such as the Labrador retriever, generally enjoy the outdoors, being with its family, and can adjust rather well to new surroundings.

, There are a wide variety of reasons you may want to get a dog and you may have specific things you need it to do. These need to be taken into consideration when deciding on a type of dog. For example, do you need a dog who is a guard dog or watch dog? Do you need to train it to do certain tasks? Do you want it to play fetch or retrieve? If these are strong needs when it comes to a dog, be sure to take them into account when picking a breed.


Don't just assume that any dog will fulfill your specific needs. Assuming that all dogs can be guard dogs, for example, is simply setting yourself, and your new dog, up for failure.

, There are advantages and disadvantages to both. If you adopt a puppy, you will have to care for it when it is very young, which is a lot of work. However, you will be able to mold it and train it into the dog you desire. If you adopt an adult dog, you will have an already developed friend that is less likely to have the accidents a puppy would. However, it may have health or behavioral issues that a small puppy wouldn't.Many wonderful puppies and adult dogs have been abandoned or given up to animal shelters or breed rescue groups. Adopting a pet from one of these sources may mean saving a life.

, After you have assessed your needs and the limitations of your lifestyle and living conditions, you should make a list of all of these parameters. This list should include a combination of requirements and desires, desires being things you want but don't have to have, such as the color of dog you like but don't need for instance.


This list will help you to narrow down a breed that it actually right for you while looking through images of a wide variety of cute and cuddly faces. If you stick to the list, you are less likely to talk yourself into adopting a dog that is super cute but very wrong for you.
You can choose a dog that has a personality that is similar to yours or a complete opposite! Either way you are bound to have fun with your dog.

, If you plan to show or breed your dog, then choose a purebred. If not, keep in mind that mixed-breed dogs can be just as loyal and lovable, and often have fewer genetic diseases and abnormalities than purebred dogs.Choosing between a purebred and a mixed-breed dog will help you to direct your research, as the personalities of mixed-breed dogs are harder to determine.

, A veterinarian can provide useful advice on a different breed's behaviors and temperaments, as well as potential medical problems. A vet's opinion is apt to be less biased than that of a breeder, who is trying to sell a particular breed.


This conversation is easiest if you have already established a relationship with a veterinarian, for instance if you took a past pet to a specific vet. However, you should feel free to contact a veterinarian cold and ask them whether they would be willing to discuss the choice with you. Then, if they end up giving you good advice, you should consider using them as the veterinarian for your new dog.

, Supplement the information you receive from a veterinarian with further study about different breeds. For an overview of breed characteristics, search the websites of dog organizations and dog experts or check the pet section of your local library. Once you have narrowed down the breeds, then you can look at the websites of specialty dog organizations and contact them for more information.


Talking to dog owners can also provide additional information.

, Spend some time with the breed you select before adopting your own. Use Facebook or other social media to see if any of your friends own one, or find owners of the breed in your city and then meet up at a dog park or other location to visit with the dog.


Discuss the pros and cons of the breed with an owner so you get a realistic understanding of what life with that breed on a day to day basis is really like.
This is a great way to find out what kind of variety exists within a given type of dog, as far as energy, size, personality, appearance, etc.

, Once you have decided on a breed or two that you would consider adopting, look at the websites of your local shelter and rescues or visit them to see if there are any dogs that fit the bill. You may just find a mixed-breed dog that is a combination of several breeds that you are considering.If you see a dog in a shelter or rescue that is of an unidentified breed, but you think it may be a dog that you have researched and liked, then discuss it with the personnel at the rescue or shelter. They may have more information on the dog that will help you to detect its breed.

, If you are set on getting a purebred dog, and you haven't been able to find the right one at a rescue, your must find a reputable breeder. Begin the hunt by looking for a list of reputable breeders on the websites of specialty dog groups in your area.You will know if a breeder is reputable if they produce a limited number of litters a year, health test parents, have a health guarantee for the puppies, provide you with medical records for the puppies including vaccinations, ask you to return the puppy if you can't keep it to ensure it doesn't end up in a shelter, and generally seem concerned and picky about who takes home their dogs.If you know someone with the breed of dog that you want, ask them where they got their dog and if they are happy with the experience. This could be a good lead to finding a great breeder.

, If you contact a breeder and they have a potential dog for you, don't adopt a dog sight unseen. You need to visit with the dog, preferably several times, in order to assess whether the dog is right for you. When visiting the dog you can assess its characteristics and personality, as well as assessing the conditions it was raised in.If a breeder won't let you visit its breeding facilities, it is a sign that they are doing something irresponsible or unethical. Most ethical breeders will be happy to show off their breeding facilities to potential adoptees.

, It's important to be able to spot a healthy and happy puppy, as well as a dog that is right for you. Assess its demeanor and personality to make sure it appears happy, inquisitive, and friendly, meaning not aggressive or overly shy. You do this by interacting with the dog and gauging whether it is interested in you and in its litter mates.


Look over the dog's coat, eyes, nose, ears, and general physical status. Look for signs of sickness, such as a runny nose or persistent cough. In addition, compare its size, weight, and general look to its litter mates to gauge its general health.
Also, in general, it's a good idea to pick a puppy that is not the biggest or the smallest of the litter and don't get the last dog left from a litter, as the best dogs usually go first.

, Ask the seller to tell you about particular habits or personality traits the dog exhibits. If they are an ethical breeder, and thus have had close personal contact with the dog, then they should be able to answer these questions easily.Also ask the seller about the parents of the puppies when visiting a purebred litter. Be sure that each parent belongs to an entirely different family and has been screened for common genetic or inheritable diseases.
If all this checks out, you just need to decide whether that particular dog is right for you.

Consider a guard dog.,
Consider a deterrent dog.,
Take your home life into account.,
Determine how much training you can commit to.,
Make a commitment to socialization.,
Consider alternatives.",How to Choose the Right Dog Breed to Protect Your Home1," Guard dogs are typically larger breeds, like Doberman pinschers or German shepherds, that have high work drives and are naturally protective. The physical presence of a guard dog can prevent intruders from entering your home, or by attacking an intruder.


Since guard dogs tend to be large and hard working breeds, they require consistent exercise, training, and space to play. They may not work well in small apartments or in homes with small children, especially if they are larger breeds.
Guard dogs can be helpful if you live in a higher crime area where home invasions are frequent, or if you live in a rural area where it would take the police a significant amount of time to reach your home in the event of a crime.;
, A deterrent dog can be a large or a small breed. They typically have a very loud bark and are naturally territorial. They will sound the alarm if someone attempts to enter a home and deter potential intruders by making noise.


Deterrent dogs may or may not be guard dogs. These dogs are known for their loud barks or their “yapping” nature.
A deterrent dog may be sufficient if you live in a low crime area where home invasions are infrequent, or if you have a firearm to protect yourself. A deterrent dog can act as a living alarm system that will alert you to someone’s presence.

, Larger breeds, whether they become guard or deterrent dogs, need more space than smaller breeds. Take the size of your home into account when you are deciding between different sized breeds. You should also take into account the kind of neighborhood you live in. If you live in a high crime area, you may want to select a guard dog that can physically attack or stop an intruder over a deterrent dog.


For instance, a Chihuahua will be more content in a small apartment than a Great Dane will be. Larger breeds, like Collies and shepherds have high levels of energy that do best in homes with large yards where they can run and exercise.

, Guard and deterrent dogs tend to be naturally protective, but training helps them to hone their instincts so they can protect your home better. While all dogs require training to be respectful and well-mannered pets, you can train a dog to become a better guard dog. It takes time and effort to train a good guard dog. Some breeds are naturally more protective and loyal than others and respond better to training, like German shepherds or a Rottweiler.


You can hire a dog trainer that specializes in guard or attack dogs. These experts can help your dog to attack on command and to identify threats. You can also have your dog trained to attack on command.When you are deciding on a breed, take into consideration whether this dog’s temperament and intelligence are responsive to training.

, All dogs need to be socialized to new experiences and new people so they can be happy and well adjusted. Guard and deterrent dogs need to be socialized so they can recognize the differences between potential threats and regular visitors to your home. Guard and deterrent dogs need to be socialized so they can identify potential threats from regular visitors to your home.Many guard dogs are naturally very territorial and protective of their space. This is a good quality in a guard dog, but can make it difficult for owners to integrate a dog into family life. Training and socialization can help dogs reduce this territorial quality while retaining their protective nature against intruders.

, Not everyone wants or can own a dog. There are alternatives to having a deterrent or guard dog that will still act to deter a potential intruder like a sign or an electronic watchdog.


A “Beware of Dog” sign in your yard can inform potential intruders that there is a dog in your home. Whether or not you actually have a dog, this sign can act as a deterrent.
Consider electronic watchdogs. An electronic alarm system “barks” when an intruder approaches the house. Like with the sign, there’s very little cost associated with something that could potentially stop a home invasion or theft."
"
Learn about aggression levels.,
Consider the size difference.,
Be aware of testosterone levels.,
Learn about potential health complications.",How to Choose Between Female and Male Dogs1," There are a lot of sweeping generalizations about dog gender, some of which are only partially true. One of the most commonly-held beliefs about male dogs is that they’re more likely to chase other dogs and that they are always more aggressive than females. While there is some truth to this, neutering your dog will dramatically reduce the likelihood of these incidents.Male dogs are more likely to challenge other male dogs, and statistically they may be more likely to show some aggression towards humans.Neutering a dog eliminates most behavioral differences between male and female dogs.This includes reducing or eliminating aggressive behavior towards humans, such as biting.;
, One of the most noticeable differences between male and female dogs within a single breed is the size difference. Male dogs tend (though not always) to be slightly larger, though this is most noticeable in dog breeds that tend to be larger in general.Of course, the most dramatic size differences are still going to be between different dog breeds, but there is still some variance within the same breed between males and females.


Generally speaking, male dogs tend to be slightly larger than females.Male dogs are often more active and exuberant when it comes to jumping, running, and chewing. The slightly larger size of males can make them physically stronger than females and more suited to endurance, but the effect is marginal.

, Though it’s not necessarily true that male dogs are always more aggressive than female dogs, the additional testosterone present in male dogs (especially male dogs that haven’t been neutered) can lead to more aggression when in tandem with low levels of socialization and obedience training.Testosterone can also cause other behavioral problems in unneutered male dogs, and it is best to neuter your dog to prevent these problems from escalating.


Many unneutered male dogs engage in urine marking (including indoor marking) and attempt to leave home while they are in heat. Some dogs will also engage in inappropriate mounting on humans, other dogs, and inanimate objects due to high testosterone levels.Neutering a male dog typically solves most of these behavioral problems, although some neutered dogs may continue to mount other dogs in an attempt to establish social dominance., Unaltered male dogs can additionally have health complications that do not as readily affect neutered dogs. Some of the most common of these complications include:


Testicular cancer - Unaltered males may develop testicular cancer in later life. However, the good news is that this is a non-aggressive form of cancer that is usually cured by surgical castration. Neutering can prevent this from occurring.Prostate disease - Unaltered males are prone to inflammation of the prostate gland. This can cause difficulty when urinating or passing feces. It is treatable either with castration or a hormone injection. Neutering a dog does not guarantee that he will not develop prostate cancer at some point in his life, but it does prevent the prostrate from enlarging and reduces the chance of prostate infection."

Consider a breed’s size.,
Understand a breed’s temperament.,
Consider the breed’s energy level.,
Look for health restrictions.,
Consider a breed’s lifespan.,
Choose between a mixed breed or purebred.,
Check for legal restrictions.,
Make sure your housemates all want a dog.,
Look at your schedule for obligations.,
Consider other dogs and small children that live in your home.,
Go to your local animal shelter or adoption agency.,
Search out dog breeders.,
Spend time meeting your dog before adoption.",How to Choose the Right Breed of Dog," Dog size can play an important role in deciding which breed is right for you. Size is most important to consider in relation to your living environment. A dog’s size can determine how comfortable they will be in your home and how much space they will need to be comfortable. A general rule is that large dogs need more space and smaller dogs need less, but there are exceptions depending on temperament and energy levels.Remember that size does not always correspond with energy level. There are many large dogs with low energy levels and small dogs that can run forever.;
, A dog’s temperament is another important factor to consider when choosing a breed. Some dogs get along better with children and other dogs, others are better at guardianship or tracking. Understanding your breed’s temperament will help you make the right decision for your lifestyle. Temperaments generally vary by breed, but they also vary by dog. It is important to evaluate your dog’s temperament when you meet them even if your dog’s breed may be known for a specific temperament.A few breeds that are good with families and children are Foxhounds, Terriers, Bulldogs, Corgis, Setters, and Retrievers.Examples of guardian breeds are German Shepherds, Rottweilers, and Dobermans.
Use resources, like the American Kennel Club, to research breed temperaments and decide on which temperament will be best for you.Consult employees at your local shelter or adoption agency. Ask questions like, “Which temperaments would you recommend for apartment living?” “Which breeds get along best with children?” or “Which breeds are best for first time dog owners?”

, Considering the breed’s energy level will allow you to evaluate the amount of time and attention you will need to spend exercising and stimulating your dog. High energy level breeds will need to be walked frequently each day, which may make them difficult to deal with if you find yourself having a busy schedule.Consider a dog with a low energy level if they will be spending the majority of their time indoors or in smaller spaces.
Examples of breeds that have low energy levels are Basset Hounds, Chows, Bulldogs, and Irish Wolfhounds.Keep in mind that breeds may be known for a specific temperament but that individual dogs can vary greatly. Get to know the dog at the shelter before you adopt. Or, if you’re buying a puppy from a breeder, make sure you approve of the parents’ temperaments.

, Some breeds are also known for common health issues, like Spaniels and ear infections or Pugs and breathing difficulties. Check for health restrictions that are associated by breed to determine whether you will be able to accommodate the necessary adjustments to the dog’s potential conditions. Use online resources and indexes to search for your dog breed and understand any health restrictions they may have.Remember that dogs who have health restrictions may also have shortened lifespans and higher healthcare costs the older they get.

, Knowing the approximate lifespan of your breed will help you choose which dog breed might be best for you. Think about how long you want to care for your dog and at what age you would like to adopt them. Knowing your dog’s lifespan will also give you an estimate of what kind of care they might need once they are in your home. For example, older dogs might need to be walked and fed less, but will need a significantly more comfortable environment than younger dogs.


A general rule is that smaller breeds tend to live longer than larger breeds.

, There are advantages to choosing both mixed breed and purebred dogs. Purebred dogs will generally have paperwork proving their genealogy, which will allow you to anticipate any health issues that might arise. Purebred’s temperaments and behaviors will also likely take after their parents’. Mixed breed dogs are more affordable and are more common in shelters and adoption agencies.


If you don’t have a specific breed in mind, go down to your local animal shelter and consult an employee about mixed breed dogs.

, Before you get a dog you will need to consult your state and landlord about potential pet restrictions. Many states have restrictions on what they deem to be aggressive breeds, often making it difficult or illegal to adopt. Some landlords will not allow animals of any kind while others might only restrict certain breeds. Ask your landlord about which dogs they will allow on their properties.Ask questions like, “I’m thinking of adopting a dog, are there any policies you have for renters?” or “Are there any pet restrictions in my lease?”
Some landlords may also require you to pay a small fee for keeping a pet in your home.
Some states may also have legislation banning specific dog breeds known for violent or aggressive behavior., Consulting all of your housemates, whether friends, family, or loved ones, about whether or they also want a dog is essential before adoption. This will ensure that your dog has a loving home once they arrive and that others are willing to help out if needed. Check in with your housemates about which dog breed they may have an aversion to, or invite them to come to shelters or adoption agencies with you.


Ask your housemates questions like, “Are you willing to live with a dog?” or “How would you feel if I adopted a dog?”

, Dogs require a lot of attention and care, and this requires a lot of your time. They need to be exercised, played with, fed, and occasionally taken out for bathroom breaks. If you have a very busy schedule, are rarely home, and travel frequently, getting a dog may not be the best choice. However, if you do have a busy schedule, or can’t make enough adjustments to be home with your dog often, then consider hiring a dog sitter or enlisting the help of a housemate.Look for breeds that are low or high energy depending on your schedule availability.

, Discussing your decision to get a dog will ensure that everyone is on board before adopting or purchasing a dog. If you already have a dog, be sure to check the current state of your dog’s temperament and training before getting a second one. If you have any small children in your home, be sure to get a breed that is low-energy and sociable to avoid any unwanted conflict or tension.

, Once you have researched enough information about the breed you’d like you are ready to start making trips to animal shelters and adoption agencies. Try to visit multiple shelters and agencies to see a large variety of breeds. Let any employee or personnel know if you are looking for a specific breed, or if they have any breed that is similar to the one you are looking for.Ask questions like, “Can you help me find a specific breed?” “How often do you receive new dogs?” or “What is the most common breed that you receive?”

, Search out dog breeders if you are looking for a specific breed or a purebred dog. Make sure that the breeder you are considering purchasing a dog from has all of the certifications to meet health and Humane Society standards. Look for breeders through kennel clubs to ensure that your are not buying a dog from a “puppy mill” or other inhumane process of breeding.Ask the breeder to let you meet your dog’s parents. Their size, temperament, and activity will give you a good idea of what your dog will be like when it grows up.
Ask your breeder to provide you with a five generation pedigree document to ensure that your dog is purebred.Ask your breeder to supply a Puppy Information Pack (PIP) to make sure that your dog is bred healthily and will have a high quality of life., Visit and spend time with your dog if you have decided on a specific dog or puppy. Go to the shelter a few times and ask to see the dog you are considering adopting. If you are going through a breeder, ask them if you can come by regularly to see your dog a few times before making a final decision. Although history, health, and behavior have an effect on your dog’s life, what matters most if your connection and relationship with your dog. Meeting your dog before you adopt will ensure that you both get along with one another and have the potential for a happy life together.


Ask the shelter or breeder if they have any toys you can use to play with the dog while you are visiting.

Evaluate your lifestyle.,
Look at their appearance.,
Look at their size.,
Look at their temperament.,
Look for a breed that is easily trained.",How to Choose the Right Dog Breed to Protect Your Home2," Guard dogs are also family dogs and will be a part of your family for many years. Choosing the right guard dog also entails understanding what kind of dog works best with your family and your lifestyle.Since most guard dogs are large and enjoy working, they need plenty of exercise and space to be happy.
Some breeds work best in homes without small children. However, other breeds can be great guard dogs and also great family pets. You’ll need to research whether the breed you’ve chosen works in a home with small children if necessary. For example, boxers, German shepherds, and Great Pyrenees are all great with kids.Rottweilers and Akitas are not recommended for families.

, Some dogs look more menacing than others. People often form associations between different breeds and their appearances based on familiarity. For example, people often associate German shepherds with protection since this breed is frequently used as a police or military dog.


Often, larger sized dogs look more menacing than smaller dogs. These dogs may have gentle temperaments and be loving family dogs but look more intimidating than smaller or toy sized breeds.
Some menacing looking breeds include Rottweilers, Doberman pinschers, Staffordshire bull terriers, and pit bulls.

, In a guard dog, size is important. Potential intruders see larger dogs as more of a threat than they do little dogs. Larger dogs are also able to physically stop or impede intruders by biting or attacking.


In this case, you’ll want to avoid dogs that are small or toy sized, like Chihuahuas or Yorkshire terriers.
Look for large breeds like German shepherds, Staffordshire bull terriers, Bullmastiffs, and Akitas.

, You want to select a breed that responds to training and is motivated to work. Dog breeds that are part of the working dog group tend to be easily trainable and motivated to follow commands.


Working dog breeds like the cane corso, German shepherd, Doberman pinscher, and Rottweiler are all highly intelligent dogs that respond well to training.Some dogs are more protective by nature. bull mastiffs, Irish wolfhounds, Bulldogs, and the St. Bernard are all fiercely loyal to their owners and are protective of them., While some dogs are naturally protective, you can train a dog to become a better guard dog. In this case, you’ll want to select a breed that is intelligent and easily trained. These dogs are eager to learn and enjoy pleasing their owners by following their commands.


Some of the more easily trained dog breeds include border collies, Labrador retrievers, poodles and schnauzers."

Learn about territorial behavior.,
Consider the size difference.,
Understand potential health complications.",How to Choose Between Female and Male Dogs2," Female dogs sometimes exhibit territorial tendencies. This is particularly true for females that are pregnant, have had puppies, or are actively ovulating.Territorial behavior in female dogs may extend beyond protecting puppies. Dogs that are ovulating may become possessive over toys, shoes, socks, or clothing. These household objects are often stored under a piece of furniture, and the furniture is aggressively guarded.Spaying the dog and encouraging social interaction with other animals will generally curb this undesirable behavior., If you’re on the fence regarding whether a particular breed can grow just a tiny bit bigger than you’d prefer, it helps to know that female dogs of a certain breed tend to stand one or two inches shorter than their male counterparts. They also weigh slightly less in accordance with their smaller size., Like unneutered male dogs, un-spayed female dogs can potentially have different health complications than spayed females. Some of these complications include:


Mammary cancer - A breeding female that has two seasons or more stands a high risk of developing mammary cancer in later life. This varies from benign local lumps that don't spread to highly aggressive mammary tumors that can prematurely end life.Ovarian and uterine cancer – Not all dogs are at risk of ovarian or uterine cancer. However, some dog breeds are predisposed to these types of cancer. Having your dog spayed will eliminate all risk of ovarian and uterine cancers.Pyometra - The more seasons a breeding female has, the more likely she is to develop a serious infection of the lining of the womb called pyometra. Left untreated, this can cause blood poisoning, kidney failure, and death. The treatment is surgical removal of the womb, so when taking on a female dog you should consider whether you’d be able to cover the cost of emergency surgery should it be necessary.False pregnancies - A female dog can develop a false or phantom pregnancy after her season. This means her body prepares for giving birth to puppies despite her not being pregnant. Typical signs include milk production, mothering soft toys, lacking energy, and some dogs will even go through mock labour. There are drugs that can dry up the milk, but in the long term, spaying in the best option since false pregnancies tend to get worse with each successive heat.Pregnancy complications - There is always the risk of complications during pregnancy, such as difficulty giving birth, mastitis, or pregnancy toxaemia. Each of these conditions requires veterinary attention, which can be costly if an emergency caesarian is necessary."

, Do you live in a rented premise? If so, does your landlord allow for pets? If you live in a unit and work full time, a dog is probably not the best choice of pet for you. Consider a cat because they are independent creatures who don't rely on you for interaction. Dogs become bored very quickly and when confined to small spaces, can develop behavioural problems.

, Will someone be home to care for your new puppy? Puppies need a lot of time and attention and cannot be left unattended. Does your work require you to travel? If so, what arrangements would you make for your dog? Do you have enough time to exercise your dog and provide them opportunities to socialise in public places? Dogs crave interaction and if you don't provide this, they can become destructive and develop social disorders which are very difficult to correct.

, Do you have children? Talk to your local vet about which dogs make the best pets for small children. Base your decision on breed and temperament - not on ""cuteness"". Small breeds such as Pugs and Maltese Terriers make great family pets because they are patient with children and can handle a bit of rough and tumble.

, New puppies require a lot of work and attention - you can never underestimate this. Agree upfront who will be responsible for each aspect of the dog’s welfare e.g. grooming, feeding, exercising, house training etc. For example, you can teach children valuable lessons in responsibility by getting them to feed the dog. Ensure that they continue this responsibility even when the honeymoon is over!

, Can you realistically afford to pay for expensive vet bills? The price of a dog is relatively cheap compared to the medical expenses you can expect to pay over their lifetime. Certain dogs are predisposed to certain conditions, so ensure that you research the breed from a medical perspective before you make your purchase. As a rule of thumb, large dogs generate higher bills not just at the vet, but also in terms of their food and accessories such as collars and leads. Consider Pet Insurance to safeguard you against hefty medical bills.

Decide if a deterrent dog meets your needs.,
Choose a loud breed.,
Look for an alert breed.,
Determine what size breed is right for you.",How to Choose the Right Dog Breed to Protect Your Home3," When you want to protect your home, you do not have to choose a dog that can physically protect you. Often, the noise that a dog makes when someone attempts to enter your home is enough to make them reconsider their plan.


Deterrent dogs need to be loud, alert, and can be trained to respond to potential threats.
Dogs that act as deterrents can come in any size and do not have to be large like a guard dog.

, A deterrent watchdog will bark loudly and often to alert you that someone is attempting to enter your home. They also help to deter potential intruders who know that loud dogs can let everyone know that someone is there.Loud dogs can alert everyone around that an intruder is present.


Golden retrievers are the loudest breed of dog; their barks have been recorded at 113 decibels. Hounds like beagles and blood hounds have deep and low barks that bellow. Their barks are loud and echo, which is helpful to alert others in the case of a potential intruder.

, Dogs that are laid back and easy going are not well suited to watchdog duties. You want to choose a breed that is alert and protective by nature. These dogs are constantly on guard and on the look out for potential threats. Many of these dogs have been bred to become alert over centuries, like the Rottweiler who is known for guarding Roman armies during wartime while they slept.Here are some breeds that are known for being very alert: Chihuahua, miniature schnauzer, dachshund, Rottweiler, and Samoyed., While guard dogs tend to be on the larger size, deterrent dog breeds can come in any shape and size. Small breeds that are known for being “yappy” and bark frequently can be good watchdogs, just like a larger breed with a loud bark can. Determining what size breed works best for you is a decision that should be made in your lifestyle, home size, and preferences in mind.


Some small yappy breeds include Chihuahuas, Yorkshire terriers, Maltese, and Pomeranians.
Medium size dog breeds include cocker spaniels, basset hounds, and beagles.
Larger dogs include golden retrievers, German shepherds, and Siberian huskies.

Decide if you want a puppy or an adult dog.,
Consider the advantages of getting a puppy.,
Ask yourself if you have the time and energy for a puppy.,
Know the additional disadvantages of choosing a dog from a breeder.,
Consider the advantages of an adult dog.,
Think about the advantages of a shelter dog.,
Weigh the downside of adopting a shelter dog.,
Remember the good you are doing when you adopt a shelter dog.",How to Choose Between a Shelter or a Breeder Dog," One of the big differences between shelter and breeders is the age of the dog when you take him home. While shelters do have puppies, born to pregnant dogs that were abandoned, by far the majority of the dogs they have are adults. However, the reverse is true for breeders. They are in the business of selling puppies, and their adult dogs are rarely for sale as they are either pets or breeding stock., The advantages of a puppy are that you have the dog from a young age, which gives you the chance to mold its young mind. It allows you to properly socialize the puppy, by exposing it to all manner of different sights and sounds.You may also feel you will bond better with a puppy, as you have been involved from them being very young.

, The downside of a puppy is that they are time consuming, messy, and liable to wake you at night. A puppy isn't house trained, which means you will need to take the puppy outside every half an hour during the day.


The puppy may also wake in the night, cry, and need to go to the bathroom, all disturbing your sleep.Puppies love to chew, so nothing in the house is safe unless it's hidden away and out of reach. They are also very energetic and easily bored. This means you need a lot of time to play with them and keep them amused.If you aren't sure you have the time and energy to cope with the difficult puppy phase, then consider adopting an adult dog from a shelter.

, There are disadvantages to choosing a dog from a breeder beyond those associated with adopting a puppy. These range from logistical problems, such as you will have to get the dog all of its vaccinations and medical procedures, to ethical problems, the strongest of these being that with the number of homeless dogs out there it is debatable whether we should bring more into the world by choice.


Another example is that purebred dogs often have health problems that they inherit. These depend on the breed, so you should do some research about common health problems in the breeds you are considering.

, To begin with there are no nasty surprises with the size and coat type of an adult shelter dog. Be aware that puppies grow, so what looks like a cute bundle of fluff at 8 weeks old could grow into a huge adult dog that you weren't expecting.Adult dogs are often already trained and housebroken, so all you need to do is show the dog the ropes in your home, such as where the toilet spot is, and then reinforce the training the dog already has.You should also have a good idea of the temperament of an adult shelter dog, as they usually undergo substantial behavioral assessments prior to homing. Shelters have protocols for testing out how dogs react to strange dogs, strangers, cats, and whether they are nervous or confident. From this they are skilled at matching dog to potential owner, so that you don't end up taking home an unsuitable dog. It is in the interest of the shelter to get this right, as a poor match means the dog coming back into the shelter., Shelter dogs are usually checked by a veterinarian prior to homing, to make sure they have no major health problems. Contrast this with a pedigree pup from a breeder. Unfortunately purebred dogs tend to have associated health problems, such as heart disease in Cavalier King Charles spaniels, and hip dysplasia in Labradors.


These health problems often don't appear until the pet is a young adult or middle aged, meaning your beloved pedigree pup leads a shortened life.Another advantage of an adult shelter dog is they are vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped, and desexed. You do pay an adoption fee to the shelter but this is a fraction of the cost of all these procedures added up, let alone a fraction of the cost of a pedigree puppy.When you adopt a shelter dog you will sign an agreement to bring the dog back to them. This is a positive bonus, as it gives you peace of mind.Breeders, however, are often reluctant to accept puppies back, because the older the puppy is the more difficult they are to sell. While there are excellent humane breeders out there who take total responsibility and will accept puppies back, there are also many breeders who run their establishment as a business and a returned puppy is a drain on resources.

, The downside of adopting a shelter pet is that you don't know their previous background, so the dog may have hidden behavioral issues that only show up when a trigger occurs. With a breeder dog, because you have the pup from a young age, you can control their exposure to unpleasant experiences and help build a confident, well-adjusted dog., When you home a shelter dog you are potentially saving two lives: that of the dog you bring home and that of the dog who moves into their empty kennel at the rescue. However, buying a breeder dog is encouraging dog overpopulation because breeders create new life in order to sell it like a product (albeit this is done in a hopefully caring and responsible way)."

Consider hiring a pet sitter.",How to Choose an Apartment Dog," Not all dog sizes are fitting for an apartment. Looking for smaller dog breeds will ensure that your dog remains comfortable in their new home. Even if you are getting a puppy it is important to choose a breed that won’t grow too big.


Ask your local animal shelter or kennel for recommendations on smaller dog breeds.
Chihuahuas, Pugs, Bulldogs, and Terriers are popular small dog breeds.;
, Choosing a dog that has a calm and quiet temperament will keep your dog comfortable and keep you from having to walk them every hour. Even though you want to tend toward smaller breeds, not all small breeds have calm and low-energy temperaments.Consult different websites and blogs online devoted to living in apartments with dogs.Some popular low-energy dog breeds are Spaniels, Beagles, Bulldogs, and Corgis., Living in an apartment means that you will inevitably have neighbors. Choosing a quiet dog that does not react and bark at every sound, noise, or movement they detect will keep both you and your neighbors happy. However, keep in mind that many smaller toy breeds can often be noisy.


Pugs, Bulldogs, and Whippets are known for being quieter, smaller breeds.Be sure to avoid guardian breeds. Guardian breeds are most likely to be territorial and react to almost every noise and movement. Common guardian breeds are Boxers, Rottweilers, Dobermans, and German Shepherds.All dogs vary, even if their breed is known for being quiet. Consult your shelter to see if the specific dog you are considering is actually quiet.

, Dense urban areas and cities can come with a large range of noises and people. The more a sociable your dog is the easier the transition to an urban lifestyle will be. Sociable dogs will also be more likely to engage with other dogs that they come across without displaying aggressive behavior.


Consult your shelter or adoption agency about your dog’s adoption history, if they have displayed aggressive behavior before, and what the circumstances were.
Ask questions like, “What quiet breeds would you recommend for an apartment?” or “Is this particularly dog generally quiet? On what occasions do they bark?”

, Go to your local animal shelter with questions about ideal dogs for apartment living. Some dogs, even larger ones, might have low-energy temperaments. Although breed is important to consider, meeting your dog and making sure you have a connection is just as important.


Ask questions at your local shelter, like “What smaller breeds would you recommend for an apartment?” “How often should I exercise this breed?” or “Is this breed generally known for being quiet?”
Consult your local animal shelter for any other informational resources they might have for keeping a dog in an apartment.

, Be upfront with your landlord about your desire to get a dog and ask about their pet policies. You will more than likely need to provide papers proving your dog’s registration and vaccination records. Some landlords might have restrictions on which breeds are allowed in your building or how many pets you are allowed to have in an apartment., Taking the interior of your apartment into consideration when choosing a dog is essential to providing a safe and friendly environment for them in your home. Make your apartment dog friendly and safe by dog-proofing lower cabinets and drawers. Scan your apartment for outlets and low hanging wires that your dog might be able to chew on.


Create a “crate space” for your dog by getting them a dog bed and crate and placing it in an uncluttered and clean location. Corners of bedrooms and living rooms make for great crate spaces.

, You’ll inevitably need to leave your apartment and the more you can bring your dog with you, the better. Looking around your apartment for dog friendly areas will provide you with alternatives for exercise and play. Look for nearby dog parks, public spaces, or outdoor areas of restaurants and cafes to bring your dog to.


If you are isolated in a dense urban area that does not have any local dog parks, consider enrolling your dog in a day care program so that they can get the socialization they’ll need.

, Keeping your dog busy inside your apartment is just as important as keeping them busy outside your apartment. Try using stimulating dog toys to engage your dog’s senses and mental faculties. Stimulating dog toys will help keep your dog engaged, occupied, and happy.


Try using multi-sensory treat dispensing dog toys, like Orka Chew, to keep your dog entertained and stimulated., Take into account your daily schedule, how often you travel, and if you know any other dog owners. All dogs, whether in an apartment or house, need consistent attention and care. Understanding the demands of your lifestyle will allow you make adjustments to give your dog a happy and comfortable life. Hire a pet sitter if you have a demanding work schedule, need to travel for days at a time, or can’t get out of social obligations.


Ask yourself questions, like “Am I able to adjust my schedule to make sure my dog gets the attention and care they need?” or “Are there any parks or open areas I can take my dog to for exercise and play?”

Evaluate how busy you are.,
Think about your free time.,
Look at your finances.",How to Choose Between a Cat and a Dog1," If you aren't home very often and are often busy with work, a cat might be a better option for you. Most cats don't depend on you that much for companionship and are fine with alone time. Plus, they use a litter box, which means you don't have to worry about them messing up the house when you aren't at home.


Dogs require more time. Dogs need 30 to 60 minutes of exercise daily. If not, they will learn bad habits such as excessive barking, destructive tendencies, hyperactivity, scratching, or biting. They also need to be taken out a few times a day.
This doesn't mean that you should get a cat if you are at home only to sleep. This would be cruel for your cat, who will need some interaction and care from you, such as fresh water daily and nail and fur care. They are just more low maintenance on a daily basis than dogs.;
, If you have a lot of free time and want to spend it with an animal, a dog is a better option. In fact, most dogs crave attention and don't like being left alone for too long. If you want a pet that you can go outside and run with, go swimming with, or just one that is more adventurous, get a dog.


If you prefer a more sedentary lifestyle, think about a small lap dog who is less prone to excessive exercise. This kind of lifestyle is also good for a cat.
If you travel from home a lot, you will need to arrange for pet care. If you leave your dog at home, she will need a pet watcher to come to your home at least twice a day to let her out and feed her. However, a cat can go for a day or two without being checked on as long as he has enough food and water available to him., Dogs and cats are not cheap. Both pets need basic things, such as food, water, and consistent veterinary care. Cats need litter, a litter box, scratching posts, and toys to remain happy, healthy pets. Dogs need more food, toys, and carriers for traveling. It is generally easier to take a cat with you or find a cat sitter, but often dogs have to be kenneled, which is an extra expense.Some cats, especially those with long or thick fur, will need regular grooming or a daily brushing. You may pay to have this done, or you may have to take time to do it yourself.The average cat costs $1035 the first year to own. For dogs, a small dog averages $1314 in the first year and a large dog averages $1843. This includes daily care as well as vaccinations and neuter or spaying. This doesn't take into account any emergency care."
"
Consider the size of your home.,
Think about those who live with you.,
Look for allergies.",How to Choose Between a Cat and a Dog2," Where you live can also impact which animal you have. Cats do fine in most environments, whether you live in a small house or a mansion with a huge yard. Dogs, depending on how large they are, require more space. It also helps to have a yard if you have a dog, which means you can just let her out to play and do her business in the back yard sometimes.If you live in an apartment, think about a small dog or a cat. In these cases, many landlords will demand an extra deposit to cover any potential damage done to their property by your pet.

, When deciding if you want a pet, you have to think about the people who live with you. If the people are your family or your significant other, the decision to have a pet will likely be one you make together. You have to figure out everyone's preferences and what they feel about the different kinds of cats and dogs.


If you live with a roommate, you will need to take into consideration their needs and desires about getting a pet. Can they handle a rambunctious puppy, a roaming cat, or a large dog in your home? You have to consider their quality of life when deciding to get a pet.
You also need to establish whether the people in your house are willing to help take care of the animal while you are away at work, school, or traveling.

, Before you get a pet, you have to check to see if your family members or roommates have cat or dog allergies. You don't want a roommate or family member to be miserable or to get attached to a pet you can't keep. To check before getting a pet, visit friends or family that have cats and dogs separately, so you can decide which one a person might be allergic to.


If you don't have friends with pets, visit the humane society to play with their animals.
Nothing is more heartbreaking than having to give up a loved pet because someone in the family has allergies, so always be sure before adopting or buying a pet.

You will need to provide the same care, restrictions, and resources that you provided your current dog when they first came home with you.


If others feel overwhelmed by the thought of getting another dog, or your current dog is unfriendly or aggressive with other dogs, it might not be time to get a second dog.;
, Making sure your current dog is well trained will help establish behavior for your second dog. Socializing your dog regularly, as well as house training and leash training your dog, will help them adjust to another dog living in their home. Take the time to address aggressive behavior to minimize any negative reactions your current dog might have to your second dog.Be sure to adopt a second dog only when you feel comfortable with the training of your current dog.

, If you live in an apartment or rent your home you may need to check with your landlord regarding their pet policy before adopting a second dog. Many landlords have pet limits and specific breeds they will allow their tenants to own.

, Although you most likely had to adjust your schedule when adopting your first dog, adopting a second will increase your workload more than you might expect. Be willing to schedule extra training times, dog sitters when you are unavailable, and frequent exercise.


Consider enrolling your dogs in a day care service where they can be social, play, and get exercise.

, Most dogs will react best to other dogs who share their temperament and energy level. If you have a large dog that has low energy then it might be best to pair them with another breed that does not constantly need to be walked and exercised.Remember that choosing a second dog is not only about the two dogs getting along. At the end of the day you will be taking care of them. Choosing dogs with similar temperaments will help reduce the amount of work you will need to do by being able to walk, exercise, and socialize your dogs at the same time.
Ask your shelter or adoption center how they perceive your potential dog’s personality and discuss the possibility of setting up an introduction.

, Choosing a dog that is sociable will increase your chances of having a peaceful cohabitation. Ask your shelter or adoption agency if the dog you are considering adopting has displayed any aggressive behavior toward other dogs and what the circumstances were. Some dogs have traumatic histories that will take time to overcome.


Consult your adoption agency or shelter to see if they offer behavioral classes or mediated meetings between dogs to start socializing your dog before you take them home.

, Aggression most commonly occurs between two female dog who live together. Consider pairing a female dog with a male, or a male dog with either a male or female. Age differences can also correspond to energy levels. If you have an older dog, a puppy might be too much for them. On the other hand, two puppies might be too much for you. Consider complimenting an old dog with another dog that is old enough to display moderate energy and behavior.There are exceptions to every rule. The only way to be sure of a match is to introduce your dogs and let them decide. Always supervise these meetings to prevent fights.

, Choosing a dog of comparable size is highly advisable, but not always necessary. Larger dogs, even in play, can seriously harm smaller dogs. Selecting dog’s of comparable size will often reduce the chance for harm. Some larger dogs can also be more energetic, which often implies differences in treatment and daily routines. However, it is not impossible to have two dogs of very different sizes in the same household, but it will require committed management and supervision.Be sure to consider both age and temperament in relationship to dog size. For example, older dogs of various sizes may be paired well together as they both have similar energy levels., There are many dog breeds that are known for being friendlier and more easily managed in multi-pet households. Considering choosing one of these breeds to adopt to reduce the risk of complications and increase the chances of your dog being welcomed into your household.


A few examples of pet friendly breeds are: Beagles, Australian Shepherds, Corgis, Springer Spaniels, and Labrador Retrievers.Consult your local pet shelter or adoption agency to see if they have any pet friendly breeds available for adoption.

, Ask friends or other dog owners if you can schedule regular play dates with your current dog and with the dog you are about to adopt. Exposing your new dog to many social and friendly dogs will help them get used to interacting in playful and kind ways. Try to meet in a dog park or another neutral location to minimize territorial reactions.


Try scheduling weekly or bi-monthly playdates to slowly introduce your new dog to their new family and friends.

, Choose a neutral location so that neither of your dogs have territorial reactions. A neutral location will also allow your dogs to greet each other as they would in a park or other social context. Making a good first impression is key to building a friendly foundation that can lead to cohabitation. When introducing dogs to one another keep them on their leashes at a distance and let them observe each other’s body language. Let them slowly come closer together until they meet on their own.Do not force your dogs to meet. If either one is displaying aggressive behavior or body language it’s best to separate your dogs and try another day.
Many shelters and rescues have staff who are specialized in facilitating dog introductions. Consult your local shelter for recommendations and services., If the dogs are aggressive towards each other or if other behavioral problems emerge after adoption, you should try to fix the issue before getting rid of one of the dogs. Look for a veterinary behaviorist, who can train the dogs to live in peace with one another.You can find a local veterinary behaviorist by searching the American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior database or the member directory of the American College of Veterinary Behaviorists.


, Occasionally differences cannot be overcome and dogs might remain incompatible with one another. Consult your adoption agency or animal shelter about their return policies so you are not stuck with two dogs who are aggressive toward one another.


This should be a last resort and not something to depend on. Make sure you are as certain as possible you have found a working match before finalizing your adoption.

Still, it is a good idea to think about your reasons for wanting a small dog before you make your decision. Are you looking for a dog that will sit on your lap and keep you company at night? Or are you looking for a guard dog that will bark to alert you if there are potential intruders nearby? Take some time to identify the reasons why you think a small dog is the best choice for you and your lifestyle., In addition to considering your reasons for wanting a small dog, you should also think about the type of personality you want your small dog to have. Small dog personalities vary greatly by breed, so it is important to identify the traits that you want your dog to have before you start considering breeds.Consider your activity level. Some small dogs are very energetic and require a lots of exercise and attention, while other dogs are quite lazy and will be happy to lounge around with you most of the time. Be realistic about how often you will be able to walk your dog and play with your dog.
Consider the other members of your household. Do you have children? Other pets? Frequent guests? Some breeds of small dogs are better with children, other animals, and new people than other small dogs. Think about who shares you home with you and what they need in a small dog.
Consider your ability to groom your dog. Some small dogs will require very little grooming, while others will require regular grooming in the form of baths, brushing, and haircuts. Think about whether you are willing and able to groom your dog yourself or if you have the money to pay a professional groomer to do it.

, Once you have considered the personality that you want your small dog to have, start researching small dog breeds to find one that is compatible with what you want. There are many small dog breeds and they all have different personalities, temperaments, and traits because of their breeding history.


Any small dog breed with “terrier” attached to the name has been breed to hunt or work, so they can be feisty and do best as an only pet. This is why your research is so valuable, because certain types of terrier are not so good with small children. Terriers as a whole have a strong instinct to chase cats and may not be the best choice if you have other pets.Talk to a veterinarian about to get a recommendation on a small dog breed that would be compatible with your lifestyle.

, Some small breed dogs are more prone to health problems than others. For example, dachshunds are more prone to intervertebral disc disease, pugs are more prone to respiratory issues, and miniature poodles are more prone to pancreatitis.Keep common health problems in mind as you consider breeds. Since owning a pet is a lifelong commitment, you should be sure that you are willing and able to deal with any health problems that your pet may encounter over the course of its life.


Consider whether you will be able to handle the veterinary bills if your pet is afflicted by a disease or other condition that is common to its breed. If not, you should consider a breed or a mix that is less likely to encounter major health problems.

, Many people surrender their dogs to local animal shelters simply because they cannot afford to keep them, not because they are bad dogs. Before you look into purchasing a dog from a breeder, check your local animal shelter to see what types of small dogs they have available. If you choose to adopt, you can take pride in the fact that you are providing a loving home to a deserving little dog and helping your local animal shelter in the process.


Adoption is cheaper than buying from a breeder, since some breeders may charge upwards of a $1000 for one of their dogs. Adoption costs are kept low to encourage people to adopt. The cost of adopting a dog is usually between $50-$200.Another advantage of adopting from a shelter is that the dog will already be up to date on his or her shots, spayed or neutered, and possibly even house trained.You can even learn about the dog’s personality from the shelter employees or the people who are currently fostering the dog.Adopting a dog from your local shelter may even save its life, since shelters are so overcrowded and many shelter have to euthanize perfectly good animals to conserve space., If you have decided to look at small dogs at your local shelter, find out when their visiting hours are and then go for a visit. When you go, ask to walk through the shelter and meet some of the available dogs. Some dog shelters have pictures of dogs available for adoption on their websites, which may help you to identify the dogs that appeal to you before you go for a visit., As you walk through the shelter, pay attention to how the dogs that you are interested in react to you. Do they seem playful, shy, aggressive, or fearful? Watch for positive body language such as wagging tails, pressing against the cage to sniff you, and relaxed open mouths. If a dog seems aggressive (barking, growling, etc.), you should probably steer clear of that dog., Once you have identified a dog that seems like it will make a good companion, ask to spend some time with the dog. You should allow the dog to come and investigate you. Allow him to sniff you and approach you in his own time. Pet the dog and see how he responds to your attention., Once you have had a chance to spend time with a dog, you should ask some questions about the dog to decide if he is right for you. The shelter employees and volunteers have spent lots of time with the dogs in the shelter, so they should be able to answer any questions that you have about the dog’s energy level, personality, and so on. Make sure to tell them what you are looking for in a canine companion as well., If possible, it is a good idea to pay another visit before you take your dog home with you. If you have a partner, children, or another dog who could not come with you on this first visit, make sure that you bring them along for the second visit. It is important to make sure that your new dog gets along well with everyone that is living in your home., If you decide that you want to purchase a dog from a local breeder, do your homework before you select one. Ask around to find a reputable breeder in your area. Talk to friends, a local veterinarian, local pet shops, and doggy day care centers to find out who the most reputable breeders are in your area. You should also pay a visit to the breeder to see where the dogs are kept and how they are treated before you consider one of their dogs.Reputable breeders will do certain things to make sure that their dogs are healthy and happy, which affects the health and temperament of the dog when you take it home.

, Reputable breeders will be happy to have you come to their home, meet their dogs, and show you around. If you contact a breeder and they seem unwilling to have you over to see their dogs and where they are kept, that is a red flag. You may want to avoid this breeder because he or she may not be taking good care of the dogs, which can mean that the dog will have health and/or behavioral problems., When you go to visit a breeder, he or she should show you where the dogs are kept. If not, make sure that you ask to see where they eat, sleep, play, etc. As a general rule, small dog breeders should keep their dogs in their home rather than in an outdoor run. Consider some of the following questions as well:Are the dogs’ living spaces clean and well-maintained?
Do the dogs have ample space to run and play or are they confined to small cages?
Do the living conditions seem overcrowded? (too many dogs for the space they are provided)

, The way that a breeder’s dogs react to you and to the breeder may also be a sign that this person is or is not a reputable breeder. Pay special attention to how the dogs react to you when you approach them or when the breeder approaches them. The dogs should not do things that indicate that they are fearful, such as cowering or hiding. The dogs should seem healthy, energetic, and playful., The breeder should seem like someone who loves dogs and also knows a lot about them. If the breeder seems to lack knowledge or seems uninterested in the well-being of dogs that she has now or has sold to other people, this may be a red flag that the breeder does not have her dogs’ best interests in mind. A reputable breeder should:be knowledgeable about the dogs he or she breeds. The breeder should also encourage multiple visits by you and your family members
show you documentation on the dogs used to breed her puppies
provide references from other families who have purchased dogs from her stock
be involved with local breeding clubs specific to the types of dogs she breeds

not always have puppies available, but be willing to put you on a waiting list for one of her puppies in the future

, Reputable breeders will not just sell their dogs to anyone with money. They will have certain requirements for the people that want to purchase one of their dogs. Consider the questions that the breeder asks you to determine if he or she is reputable. If the breeder is reputable, you should be able to answer yes to all of the following questions:Does the breeder require you to explain why you want a dog?
Does the breeder ask you to explain who will provide the dog’s needs such as walking, feeding, and training?
Does the breeder ask you to sign a contract saying you will spay or neuter the dog unless you plan to breed it?
If you rent, does the breeder ask you to provide proof that dogs are allowed in your apartment?
Does the breeder ask you to provide references?
Does the breeder provide you with a health contract and give you plenty of time to look it over before signing?
Does the breeder ask you to sign a contract saying that you will return the dog to him or her if you are no longer able to care for the dog?

Choose your puppy.",How to Choose a Yorkie Puppy," The average Yorkshire terrier can live anywhere from 12 to 16 years.This dog will be in your life for a long time, so don’t get a puppy if you’re not prepared to make a long-term commitment. Furthermore, dogs who don’t get enough care and attention on a day-to-day basis often develop behavior problems like excessive barking, chewing, and digging in the yard.While Yorkies don’t need as much exercise as other breeds might, they do need a lot of attention and love.


If you don’t have the time to give your pet all the attention it needs to be happy and well-adjusted, wait until you’re ready to bring a dog into your family.;
, When you get a Yorkie, you’ll have to pay more than just the one-time purchase price. All dogs have ongoing needs throughout their life, including good quality food, toys, grooming, licensing fees, and routine medical checkups. You’ll also spend a lot of money during the first year on a crate, a carrier bag, training sessions, spaying/neutering, vaccinations, etc. The ASPCA estimates that in the first year, small dog owners will spend about $1,314 on their new pet, then $580 yearly after that., There's a great deal of variation in size, temperament, and needs from breed to breed. Even if you love all dogs, you should think carefully about whether a specific breed will be a good fit for you and your family. Yorkshire terriers have many positive traits:They are a ""Toy"" breed, meaning they are small lap dogs that won't hog the couch or be able to overpower you when they get excited.
They're highly adaptable, and do well in large homes and apartments alike.
Though each dog will have its own personality, in general, Yorkies are cat-friendly.
Yorkies are a highly intelligent breed, and take well to training.
They're incredibly affectionate companions who love to be around their families.

, Though there’s a lot to recommend the Yorkies, all breeds have drawbacks that might make them a bad fit for a particular household. Some things you should know about Yorkshire terriers before bringing one home include:These are territorial dogs who bark a lot. While this makes for a good watchdog, early training to curb excessive barking is important for a happy household.
Though they love to relax and cuddle, Yorkies are very high energy and love to dash about the house.
Their long coats mean owners must make a commitment to regular grooming and be willing to deal with shedding fur.
They may be affectionate, but Yorkies can also be a bit snappy at times.
This, combined with their small size, might make them a bad fit for families with small children in the house.
All purebred breeds have health concerns. The Yorkie's include knee problems, collapsing trachea, dental issues, hypothyroidism, hypoglycemia, and Legg-Calve-Perthes disease.

, A healthy adult should weight between 4 and 7 pounds. That said, ""teacup"" Yorkies — though not an official breed — are dogs that have been bred specifically for their small size. They may weight 1-3 pounds when grown. The size of the grown dog can only be estimated at birth, so there's no guarantee that your ""teacup"" Yorkie won't grow to be 5 pounds in adulthood.


Note that breeding for the ""teacup"" size is often done at the expense of the dogs' health. You may have to deal with higher medical expenses with the smaller dogs.

, You have three options for locating a Yorkshire terrier puppy: breeders, breed rescues, and general animal shelters. Each of these sources has its own pros and cons:


Breeders: a breeder can provide the dog's lineage if a strong pedigree is important to you. However, breeders can be expensive, and unethical breeders might not provide the best care for your puppy in its earliest days. A bad breeder may also breed unhealthy dogs.
Breed rescues: look for Yorkie-specific rescue centers in your area. These animals need good homes, so if you want to save an animal, a breed rescue is a good option. However, you will not have access to the dog's pedigree, and many dogs might be mixed-breed. You may also find more adults than puppies.
General animal shelter: it will be hard to find a purebred Yorkie in a general animal shelter, and you’ll likely find more adults than puppies. However, if the shelter’s a kill shelter, you might save your dog’s life. Furthermore, shelters are usually far cheaper than breeders or breed rescues.

, Many rescues and shelters have websites that are updated regularly with the new dogs available for adoption. Keep an eye on these websites for the puppy you want to rescue.


If you don’t see a suitable puppy on the websites, call the rescues and shelters to see if you can be put on a notification list. They may be willing to call you if a Yorkie puppy comes into their care.

, If you choose to buy your puppy from a breeder, you should conduct a thorough investigation into how ethical the breeder is. There is no license for breeding — anyone with a litter of puppies can call him- or herself a breeder. You want to make sure you only buy a puppy from someone who takes the responsibility of breeding animals seriously. A quality breeder will let you ask questions even if they don't have any puppies for sale. They may be able to refer you to someone who does have puppies at the moment.


Ask the breeders how long they’ve been breeding Yorkies, and whether they’ve seen any health issues in the dogs they’ve bred.
Do their dogs have a good pedigree, and will the breeder provide pedigree papers to ensure the puppy doesn’t come from an inbred line?
Do they dock, or cut off, their puppies' tails? Docking is an unnecessary cosmetic procedure that’s illegal in some countries. This is a form of mutilation, and that breeder should not be encouraged in any way.
If you want to raise Yorkies yourself, ask if the breeder requires you to spay/neuter their puppies.
Do they have a return policy, in case your situation changes or you discover a health issue in your dog?
Have they already begun the litter’s vaccination program? What shots have they had, and what will you have to get them?

, A breeder can say whatever they’d like over the phone, but you should visit your top choices in person to see for yourself that they are trustworthy operations. A good breeder will socialize puppies from a young age so they trust humans. Though some puppies might be shyer than others, in general the litter should be comfortable around people. Ask to see the whole litter with its mother to make sure the family is kept together and happy, and that the puppies weren’t weaned too early.


Make sure the facilities are clean, and that each dog has comfortable living quarters with its own food and water bowl.
You should not see more than 1 or 2 Yorkies crowded into a single kennel.
Check that the dog areas are tidy and free of feces or urine. A good breeder will clean their kennels daily.
If the operation seems unprofessional or questionable, cross that breeder off your list.

, Because they are more interested in money than the quality of the dogs’ lives, they do not provide adequate care for the animals in their care. Puppies from mills often come home with giardia, parvovirus, and other diseases that would be addressed by a proper breeder. They often overbreed and inbreed their dogs, resulting in genetic health conditions that will reveal themselves as the puppy grows up. Because puppy mill breeders don’t spend time with their animals, mill puppies are often unsocialized, and even fearful of humans.


Puppy mills are inhumane. Do not, under any circumstances, support a breeder who treats his or her animals improperly.

, To find the right Yorkie, you need to see how they act with their siblings. Check the puppies for shyness. If 4 out of 5 puppies run away or act afraid of you, they may have a genetic predisposition for shyness. Odds are the 1 brave puppy has the same genetic coding, so you should look for the perfect Yorkshire Terrier in another litter or with another breeder.


Watch the puppies play with each other. Normal puppies are curious, friendly, and like to play.
Look for warning signs: is the puppy anxious? Fearful? Aggressive?

, Ask the breeder if you can spend some time with each of the available puppies individually. To find the right Yorkie, you need to make sure the puppy is healthy and evaluate how they act when not surrounded by their siblings.


Inspect the puppy's fur, eyes, rear end and ears. A healthy Yorkshire Terrier puppy will have clear eyes, a clear nose, a shiny coat, and clean ears. An ill puppy may have a matted or shabby coat, discharge, a cough, a potbelly, and dirty ears.
Test the puppies' hearing. Make a loud noise and see if the puppy reacts. A puppy with good hearing will react right away and then become curious about what caused the sound.

, Puppies require frequent vet visits for vaccinations and checkups in their early months. Have the puppies already been treated for heartworm and parasites or been given their vaccinations? If not, you will have to pay for all of those procedures out of pocket.

, Remember that you are choosing a Yorkie puppy, the puppy is not choosing you. If you select the puppy that runs right up and jumps all over you, you may end up with the most energetic puppy in the litter, and have regrets later on. Choose the puppy that has the best personality and is not too bossy nor too timid. A Yorkie with a good nature will wag its tail, not bully its siblings, and not growl or bite.


Do not choose a puppy that has any behavioral or health concerns.

Research different breeds.,
Check the temperament.,
Get a pet.",How to Choose Between a Cat and a Dog3," Before you can get a pet, you need to find the right breed of animal for you. Think about the kinds of breeds you think you'd like and then research them. You can do this online, through your vet, or by talking to knowledgeable people.


This applies to both species. Some cats need more attention than others. Some dogs are more vocal than others. Some breeds tend to have worse tempers than others. All these details are important if you want to find a pet that will suit you.
If you aren't sure, try the American Kennel Club's online dog breed selector program or the American Humane Society's online checklist on cat breed selection., The kind of animal you want may depend on their temperament or physical capabilities. You might want a rambunctious puppy that will turn into a big dog in need of a lot of exercise, especially if you are a very active person. If you are more a walk in the park kind of person, consider a small dog breed that enjoys slower activity.


Cat's can be very temperamental. If you want a pet to hold, pet, and snuggle with all the time whenever you want, you may need to get a small dog. If you want an animal that will snuggle with you and love on you when he wants but not all the time, a cat might work better for you., Once you have examined all the factors and know you can handle a pet, live in the right place for a pet, and know which kind you want, you need to choose a pet. Spend time searching for the perfect pet for you. Search the internet or classified sections to find pets for sell. This is a good method if you want a particular purebred animal. Also visit your local humane or rescue society to consider adopting a fine, healthy pet.


If you find one you like, contact the owner or shelter people to let them know you’re interested in the animal. Then, return to the place every day for a few days to spend time with the animal. This will help you both adapt before you take her home.Some shelters and owners will let you take the animal as a foster pet for a while until you become familiar with what she is like and decide you want to keep her.

Learn all you can about the different temperaments puppies can have.,
Take the puppy you want to test to a quiet, neutral place with no other dogs or other distractions.

,
Stroke the puppy from head to tail and lift up his feet, tail and ears.,
Pick him up, or roll him onto his back.,
Make a number of different noises with your voice, from high to low.,
Put a soft collar and a leash on him.,
Take the puppy outside if the breeder or owner allows it.,
Feed the puppy once you're inside again.,
Keep in mind that a responsive puppy will be accepting of your handling, curious, and keep looking at you and wagging its tail.,
Choose your puppy by temperament based on his reactions to the steps outlined above.",How to Choose a Puppy by Temperament," In general, puppies are classified as responsive, nervous, aggressive or independent.


A responsive puppy is adaptable and binds well with humans, which makes it a good choice for a first-time dog owner.
A nervous or shy puppy is unpredictable, and not a good choice for families with children or other busy households.
An aggressive puppy is dominant, sometimes unpredictable and does best in a household without children or other pets.
An independent puppy is stubborn and best suited to an outdoor life.;
,, Evaluate how he reacts to your handling, and whether he enjoys it.

, Put your hand over his throat. See how he reacts, and whether he's scared or resists.

, Whistle, and rattle a chain or your keys., Give him a few minutes to adjust, then try walking a couple of steps and see if he will walk with you

, See how he reacts to other people and animals.

, If he wants to eat, allow him to do so, then take the bowl away again after a few bites.

,


A nervous dog is stiff to the touch, his eyes are wide open with fear, he's scared and runs away, and won't eat. When performing the leash test, he won't move.
An aggressive dog will resist your handling and petting, will growl and bite your hand or the leash, and bark and lunge at everything.
An independent puppy isn't interested in you at all and wants to explore things on his own.

, Remember, a responsive puppy is always interested in what you do and doesn't challenge you, unless it's to play. Nervous and aggressive dogs require an experienced dog owner and a lot of attention to keep them in line, while an independent dog is best suited to be a working dog such as a guard dog, sheep dog, or hunting dog.

Think about cost.,
Ask yourself how often you’re at home.,
Reflect on your own experience.",How to Choose Between a Puppy and an Adult Dog1," If you have unlimited resources and budget isn’t a concern, feel free to skip this step. Otherwise, keep in mind that a puppy is more expensive, both up front and over the long run. If the idea of bringing home a dog in general is already making you worry about bills, go with an adult dog.Purebred puppies typically have an upfront sticker price that is much more expensive than adults.
Assuming that a puppy grows to full adulthood and fulfills its life expectancy, the long-term cost of food, vet visits, and medication will be higher than an adult.
Puppies require lots of training, which means more dollars toward treats, cleaners and pee pads, or even professional help.
Adult dogs and especially senior ones may have already developed medical issues that require regular medication and/or vet appointments.;
, Expect puppies to require much more direct supervision and training than adult dogs. Figure out how much time you spend out of the house, and for how long of a stretch you’re away each time. The less time you spend at home, the more you should consider an adult dog.Also consider which out-of-the-house activities you’re willing to sacrifice or include your dog in. For instance, if you go out to the movies every Friday night, you can easily nix this for a few months. On the other hand, if you like to jog in the park every Sunday morning, you can just as easily bring your pup along with you.
If you stay at home for most or even all of the day, also consider any at-home responsibilities that might interfere with raising your dog. For example, if you work remotely from home, are you free to walk away at any time and come back later, or are you required to be on-call for specific hours?
If you’re thinking about adopting a rescue dog (regardless of its age), these same considerations should also be applied if they have behavioral issues, since these may require just as much attention as a puppy at first.
Even a well-behaved dog that’s already been trained well will require some additional training on your part. This will help it adjust to its new living situation, learn new commands it may not have needed before, and develop a bond with you.

, Ask yourself: will this be your first dog ever? If you’ve had a dog before, how old was it when you got it? If it was a puppy, were you actively involved in its training, or did someone else handle it, like your parents, roommate, or significant other? The less experience you have, the more likely an adult dog is the right age for you.Of course, there’s a first time for everything, including raising a puppy. If you’ve had experience with adult dogs before and would like to try your hand with a younger one, go ahead.
That said, brace yourself. Your new puppy is undoubtedly going to be way more energetic and demanding than your last dog.
If, however, you have no experience with dogs whatsoever, definitely go with an adult dog. Learn the basics of caring for a dog with one that’s already more self-sufficient than a newborn.

Check the puppy's health.",How to Choose a Puppy," Do you have a stable financial status and steady income? Keeping a dog is not cheap; equipment, food, and vets fees can cost a lot.Cost will affect your choice of dog. Large dogs, for example, often cost more because they can have health issues that are less common in smaller dogs and because they eat a ton of food.
Ensure you have ""emergency funds"" available for emergency trips to the vet, surgeries, and tests. Sometimes things will happen outside of the regular schedule of check-ups and shots for puppies. You'll want to give your pet the best care possible, so make sure you are financially able to do so.;
, Do you live in the country or in a town or city? Do you have a condo, apartment, or house? Where you live and the space you have available should influence what kind of puppy you get. Puppies need space and fresh air so think about this carefully before making your decision.


For example, think about what kind of space you have in your house? A big, loud dog in a small house will drive everyone crazy. Further, it's not healthy for a big dog to be cooped up in a small space. You want to choose a puppy whose adult size will suit the space you have available.
Think about outside space. Do you have a backyard? Puppies have lots of energy, and they need space to exercise.Having a backyard also allows you to train your puppy to urinate outside. If you live in an apartment building or condo in an urban area, consider where the nearest parks, green spaces, and dog parks are.

, Do you have time to care for your puppy? A new puppy needs lots of care and training. Are you willing to plan your life around your pet's needs? If you're working 12 hour days or travel frequently, a puppy is probably not a good fit for your lifestyle.


Puppies are fun but their energy can make them time-consuming. In the first few weeks, you will need to housebreak your puppy and teach it to obey simple commands.
You'll also have to find time to take your puppy for one or two good, long walks every day. Letting them out to urinate or for a 5-minute run in the yard or park is not sufficient. Exercise that drains both the dog's physical and mental energy is key to keeping your puppy stable and happy.Vet visits will also be more common in the first year; the puppy will have to vaccinated, wormed and neutered.

, Consider the wants and needs of your family, as these will shape your choice of puppy. Does anyone in the family have an allergy to dogs or a specific type of dog, for example? Is anyone deathly afraid of dogs? Getting a puppy is a big decision so you want to make sure you're ready and choose the right one. Puppies grow into dogs and will likely be in your life for the long-term so you want to view him or her as an addition to family and something that everyone will be invested in and love.


Think about the pets you already have, if any. Consider the temperaments of your current pets and how they generally react to other dogs and animals. For example, a male cat that you've had for a very long time could easily get jealous. In addition, bringing in an energetic puppy could be stressful for older pets. It may take a while for your older pets to accept your new puppy, but often the relationship works itself out.Consider your future plans. Are you moving or thinking of moving in the next year? Moving pets - especially by plane - can be stressful and expensive, so think about whether you'll be stationary for a while. Are you pregnant or thinking of starting a family soon? Juggling puppies and babies can be challenging as both require your love, attention, and constant care. You'll want to be sure you can manage your time and are comfortable with animals around infants.Sit down and think about the next few years and really evaluate how a pet fits into the life you envision.

, Is there a good vet and emergency vet nearby? Are there any kennels in the area or friends in the neighborhood who could ""pet-sit"" if you go on vacation and can't take the puppy with you.


If you work a lot but remain committed to getting a puppy, you might think about hiring someone feed and walk the dog while you're at work.

, Do you want a big or small dog? The answer should to some degree be contingent on your evaluation of your home and neighborhood.


Big dogs like the Great Dane and the St. Bernard are calm and gentle, while breeds like the Jack Russell terrier are smaller, more energetic. However, large and small dogs both have their fans. The truth about which dog is better behaved likely lies in the eye of the beholder and depends on the individual dog.Generally, a small dog one that weighs less than 22lbs or is shorter than 16 inches. Smaller dogs tend to be popular among people living in cities, those who live in apartments, and individuals lacking a large living space., Research the type of breed and pay attention to information on temperament, needs, health, sex differences, and any other details that may affect your decision.You may also of course already have a breed in mind from when you were younger that you've been dreaming of getting your whole life.

, Purebreds are dogs whose parents and other ancestors are all members of the same breed. Mixed breeds, on the other hand, are basically combinations of different breeds of dogs.Purebred puppies are more expensive than the mixed breeds, but it's also easier to anticipate how big purebred dogs will get and what their full size will be.Mixed breed puppies are generally healthy and strong and come in a wide range of colors, types, and sizes.Purebreds are more prone to inherited diseases than mixed breeds. However, good breeders of purebred dogs test the parents for thyroid disease, anomalies of the eyes, shoulder and hip issues selecting against negative traits.Ultimately, there are advantages and disadvantages to both types of pedigrees. However, at the end of the day, how your puppy turns out will depend entirely on how you raise, nurture, and train your puppy., Some believe that male dogs are more affectionate and easier to train and that female dogs are more aggressive and protective. However, sex differences appear to be largely anecdotal. There's no study proving that a dog will behave a certain way because it is male or female..


Any sex differences may also depend on the breed, so do your research. Further, neutering the puppy can make the distinctions between male and female personalities disappear.

, There are lot of options, including pet rescue centers, pet stores, or private breeders. You can even search websites like Kijiji. Where you get your pet from will depend on whether or not you have a specific type in mind and how much money you have to spend, among other factors.


If possible, select a puppy from a healthy litter that has been brought up with its mother, rather than in kennels. This puppy will adapt more quickly to its new life in your home.
Choosing the right owner or breeder is vital. A breed club is a good place to start your search, as they may have a list of litters available. The club could also put you in touch with respected breeders in your area to get the ball rolling. You could also try attending a dog show to meet breeders and owners to get more information.Never buy from a puppy mill. They breed much too often from the same female and often don't care for the puppies properly. Puppy mills breed to make money and do not usually care about the health and happiness of the dogs; further, they may not tell you about any fatal diseases or health concerns because they just want your money.

, Once you've decided where to get your puppy from, inquire into the background of the institution or breeder. Figure out whether they know a lot about dogs and seem invested in promoting the well-being of the animals.For example, if your buying a purebred dog, talk to the breeder. Good breeders spend a lot of time with their animals and should be able to tell you about each puppy's personality. If you're buying a mixed breed, ask as much as you can about the puppy's parents - that way you will have a good idea of what it will be like when it grows up. Inquire also into the health history of the parents.

, Before you pick puppy over another, watch the puppies closely to see which seem energetic or lazy, affectionate or aggressive, anxious or calm.Do more than just look; play with all the puppies and get to know them. Look for the ones that walk up to you and licks your hand while wagging their tails.
After observing the entire litter, you’ll probably have a sense of which puppies you’re most interested in. You can then assess each puppy separately, in a quiet area where he or she won’t be distracted by noise, food or the other puppies.Make sure that your puppy is used to being handled from birth and has had contact with people; this makes it more likely that your puppy will grow up to be friendly.Be cautious of puppies who are very shy, cower, try to bite, have tantrums, or defecate or urinate when restrained. These puppies are likely to continue to react this way unless they receive carefully planned training., You’ll increase your chances of getting the right puppy if you rely on both your heart and head. Take into consideration both your feelings toward the puppy and your objective observations of his or her physical and behavioral health., Inquire about your chosen puppy's health and whether its had his/her shots. You can also do a physical examination yourself. Here are some things for you to keep in mind:Energy level: A healthy puppy will be alert and interested on what is going on around him/her.
Hearing: A puppy with good hearing should react if you clap your hands behind his/her head.
Vision: A puppy with clear vision should see a ball or other toy that rolls past in his or her field of vision.
Body condition: A healthy puppy's tummy should feel soft when you press it gently. The puppy should look well fed and have some fat over his rib cage.
Genitals: The puppy should not have any feces or pus visible in the genital area.
Eyes: A healthy puppy should have clear, bright, and open eyes without crust or discharge.
Ears: Check the puppy's ears and teeth. They should be clean.
Coat: A puppy's coat should be attractive without dandruff, dullness, flakiness or red patches. The fur should be shiny and healthy.
Do a flea check. Look for small, black specks in the puppy's fur. Don't get too upset if you find one though - it's easy to get rid of fleas.

Decide how exclusive of a relationship you want.,
Factor in the dog’s medical needs.,
Evaluate the dog’s behavioral history.,
Consider the dog's size.",How to Choose Between a Puppy and an Adult Dog2," There’s nothing wrong with wanting to be your dog’s one and only owner. So if you’re deadset on raising a newborn from scratch so you can be your best friend’s ONLY best friend in life, then go for a puppy. With that said, keep in mind:


Having previous owners won’t prevent an adult dog from being just as loyal and loving toward you.An adult rescue dog’s traumatic past can often be overcome with patience, training, and love, resulting in a happy, healthy pet.
The hidden benefit of many adult dogs is that they have already been excellently trained.
There is no accurate predictor of how a dog will develop, so puppies may not mature into the adult dog that you expected.

, This may seem counter-intuitive, but if you’re worried about having to go to the vet unexpectedly and/or repeatedly, consider leaning toward an older dog. Of course, an adult dog (and especially a senior dog) may be more likely to have a definite medical condition, but take this as a positive. Instead of leaving it up to chance, know exactly what you’re getting into regarding any pre-existing issues, how often the dog will need a check-up, and what medication it will need.As with humans, puppies’ immune systems aren’t fully developed, which means they may fall ill much easier than adults. This is one of many reasons why you should pick an adult dog if you’ve never owned a dog before.
Additionally, puppies may carry genetic defects from their parents that may not be evident when they’re young. However, as they age, these defects could manifest into later medical issues.
Of course, with rescue dogs you often don’t know their full medical history. However, many if not all animal shelters routinely exam new arrivals and share the results with potential adopters.

, Whether you’re talking about a puppy or an adult, this is a little trickier than determining their medical history. There’s no foolproof way to predict exactly how a dog will behave in your home, but regardless, take the time to get a sense of a dog’s personality before deciding that this is the one for you. Get a sense of how much work you will have to devote to helping them socialize with people and other dogs and learn basic obedience training.Adult dogs are, of course, more mature than puppies and easier to assess after puberty. However, an animal shelter is a new environment for them, so they may not act as they normally would in a home environment.
Similarly, if you’re considering adopting an adult directly from its previous owner, differences between your two homes (such as noise levels, frequency and number of guests, and a lack of children and/or other dogs in one home) may cause the dog to act differently in your home.
Puppies’ behavior can be predicted in general terms by breed, as long they’re purebred. Mixed breeds, however, are much harder to predict. In either case, their behavior will be largely dependent on the amount and quality of time that you spend training and socializing them.
Always observe a potential new pet interacting with other dogs and people. Then ask the store, shelter, or owner if you can take the dog on a walk to see how it acts when it’s alone with you. If possible, arrange for a test visit in your own home to see how they react to it.

, Although there is no 100% guarantee either way, expect smaller breeds (such as miniature poodles, shih tzus, and Jack Russell terriers) to live the longest at upward of 14 years. Expect larger dogs (such as bull dogs, Great Danes, and greyhounds) to live the shortest, for as little as 7 years. If you're wary of bringing a puppy home, choosing a smaller breed can help you find a dog that still has plenty of years left. However:Although smaller dogs also typically finish puberty earlier than larger dogs, on a mental and emotional level, dogs still mature at about the same rate (by age two or three), regardless of size.Larger dogs are recommended with families with young children, since they're less likely to feel threatened or be harmed by kids who are smaller than them. However, the shorter life expectancy may be difficult to deal with."
"
Talk with your partner.,
Take kids into consideration.,
Avoid puppy mills.",How to Choose Between a Puppy and an Adult Dog3," If you have a significant other who lives with you and will be “sharing” your dog, have a conversation about what you each want out of a dog. Caring for any pet is a big responsibility, so figure out if this one will be evenly shared between the two of you, or if all that your partner intends to share is living space. Discuss matters like:


Whether they’re willing to tag-team the constant supervision and training that a puppy would require, or if they would be more comfortable with an older dog that is more likely to behave itself when left on its own..Whether they have any experience caring for dogs. A lack of experience may place more burden on you (meaning an older dog may be the way to go if you have other commitments). A history of caring for dogs, however, could offset your own lack of experience (which means that a puppy may be back on the table).
How long of a commitment they’re willing to make. Depending on the breed, dogs may live as long as 14 years or even longer.While your partner may be eager to bring a dog home, they may be hesitant about such a prolonged commitment, especially if they’ve never cared for a dog before.

, If you have children in the house, your decision may be easier. If the children are young, go with an older dog. If they’re old enough to more or less take care of themselves, an older dog may still be the way to go (depending on how hectic everyone’s various schedules are), but consider teens as a possible extra hand to help raise a puppy if you’re heart is set on one.Training and socializing dogs effectively means being consistent in your approach. Since puppies require the most work (and therefore the most consistency), only consider them if your kids are mature enough to exercise self-control.Obviously, if you have kids, your primary concern should be them. Regardless of how old they are, weigh considerations like how much money and time you can dedicate to a new dog versus how this will affect similar demands on you from your children.
Puppies are usually very playful, which may make them seem like ideal playmates for young kids. However, dogs often use their jaws to play-bite, which might confuse and scare very young kids. This is another reason why a calmer adult dog is more suitable.
Adult rescue dogs with behavioral issues may require the same level of attention, patience, and consistency as puppies.

, If your final decision is to bring home a puppy, try to find one either direct from a responsible breeder or a legitimate animal shelter. Be aware that many pet stores get their puppies from mills, which often keep the parents in unsavory conditions. Instead of supporting this heartless practice, either adopt a rescue dog or research the breeder. A responsible breeder should:Wait until the puppy is at least eight weeks old before offering it for sale.Should be willing to give you a complete tour of their facilities.
Share both the puppy’s and the parents’ medical histories and tell you who their vet is.
Ask you questions about your own situation to ensure that you and the puppy will be a good fit.
Allow parents time to recuperate from giving birth, meaning they should not have puppies available 365 days out of the year.

Does its energy level suit the amount of exercise you can provide? Careful consideration of these questions will ensure your puppy's well-being and will also impact the happiness of your household.;
, Puppies love to explore with their mouths. To keep your puppy and house safe, you'll need to take a few precautions.


Remove breakable items from the area where you plan to keep your puppy.
Keep all electrical cords raised or covered, and close all low windows.
Lock away toxic cleaning supplies/chemicals.
Get a trash can that is too tall for him to get into and too heavy to knock over, or store the trash can in a cabinet.
Consider getting a folding gate or exercise pen to keep him confined to a certain room or area.

, The kitchen or bathroom is an ideal place for his bed during the day because those rooms are usually warm and have washable floors. At night, keep your puppy in his crate in your bedroom. This will allow you to hear him during the night, so you will know if he needs to go outside to relieve himself.

, These are better than glass because they do not chip and stay cleaner. If you have other pets, be sure to give each pet their own food and water bowls to avoid conflict. At feeding time, you will separate them to prevent fighting over food and to ensure each pet gets the nutrition they need.

, You might consider a crate with a crate pillow, a snuggle nest, or a wicker basket with a lot of towels. Whichever option you choose, make sure it is always soft, clean, comfy, and dry. Have a blanket on hand in case of cool weather. To avoid conflict, each pet should have their own bed.

, Your puppy will be a ball of boundless energy, so make sure you get plenty of toys, including both chew toys and soft toys. The toys should be sturdy enough to prevent choking hazards. Don't give rawhide to puppies as a toy; use it only as a treat and watch him as he chews.

, Training treats should be healthy, small, and easily chewed or swallowed. Their purpose is to communicate quickly that the puppy did something you liked, but you don't want to wait around for them to finish eating when you want to continue the training.


Consider “Bil-Jac” or “Zuke’s Mini Natural” treats.
Look for treats about the size of a pencil eraser head. If your treats are larger, break them up into smaller pieces.
Make sure you get a variety: crunchy and soft. The soft will be good for training, and the crunchy will help clean teeth.

, Kibble, canned food, home cooked food, and a raw diet are all options for a puppy, but discuss each with your veterinarian. When you first get your puppy, ask the breeder, rescue group, or shelter what food your puppy was eating with them. You can continue that diet when they first come to their new home. If you want to make a change, do so after a few weeks, and transition to the new food gradually, over a week or so. Changing foods abruptly can cause vomiting or diarrhea.


Buy a puppy food with no dyes, artificial flavors, or preservatives, as many dogs are allergic to these additives.
A raw or home-cooked meal is a serious commitment, as you will need to take extra steps to prepare the food and ensure your puppy's nutritional needs are met. Discuss these options with the veterinarian first.

, At the very least, every dog owner needs a bristle brush, comb, rubber gloves, nail clippers, dog shampoo, dog conditioner, dog toothpaste, dog toothbrush, and towels. Grooming isn't just about keeping your dog pretty. These tools will keep him healthy and happy, too.

, Poorly sized collars can hurt puppies' necks and injure their throats. Remember when sizing the harness or collar that your puppy will grow.

, Your puppy might be frightened when introduced to his new home for the first time. Give him extra love and attention those first few days. While wearing a light leash, let your puppy investigate different parts of the house and yard while you follow him around. You don’t have to show him everything on the first day, but the common areas are a good start.


Do not let your puppy roam free because accidents will happen.
Have your puppy sleep in your room in his crate at night so he doesn't feel isolated or alone.

, It's important to stroke your pet's body, legs, and head often throughout the day. This will not only make him feel loved, but also allow you to create a strong bond with your puppy.It will also get him used to being touched and handled.


Pet your puppy and stroke down his legs, touch his paws, and his belly so he will be comfortable with this contact in the future when you need to have him groomed or clip his nails.

, Puppies, like human babies, are fragile. Gently scoop your puppy into your arms if you need to pick him up. Keep one hand on his chest at all times and support his bottom with your other hand.

, Puppies are naturally curious, and even with the most attentive care they sometimes escape the yard and get lost. Make sure your puppy wears a comfortable adjustable collar with a tag that lists your contact information. The tag should include your puppy's name, along with your address and phone number.


Many jurisdictions require you to get a dog license. It's a good idea to get your puppy licensed even if it's not required.
Your puppy will need to have its rabies vaccination to receive his dog license.

, The microchip is tiny — about the size of a grain of rice — and is placed under the skin, behind the neck and above the shoulders. You will register the microchip with your contact information when the vet implants it in your puppy. If he ever gets lost, a vet or shelter will be able to scan the chip and call you to reunite you with your pet.


Even if your puppy has a collar and tag, experts recommend that all pets have microchips that can't be removed.

, A securely fenced yard is ideal. Experiment a little to find out which toys he likes best. Indoors, use an exercise pen to confine your dog in his own “playpen” or play area until he is house trained., While it's tempting to go for the cheap stuff, this is not the best choice for your dog. Look for foods that incorporate high-quality proteins from fish, chicken, lamb, beef, and/or eggs. Talk to your veterinarian about diet choices. If you plan to change his food, do so gradually to reduce the chance of an upset stomach.

, Give him small amounts of food formulated for puppies several times a day. The amount of food for each meal depends on the breed and size; look up the recommended amounts for your breed. Feed your puppy only the smallest amount recommended for his breed, age, and size. Increase the amount if the puppy seems too thin, or as directed by your veterinarian. The number of daily feedings depends on the puppy's age:


six – 12 weeks: three to four times daily
12 – 20 weeks: three times daily
20+ weeks: two times daily

, Very small breeds (Yorkshire Terriers, Pomeranians, Chihuahuas, etc.) may be prone to low blood sugar. These puppies often need access to food all day long (or every two to three hours) until about 6 months of age. This prevents their blood sugar from dipping too low, which can lead to weakness, confusion, and even seizures.

, Meal feeding will help with housebreaking and prevent your dog from gorging on food. Furthermore, your puppy will bond with you by associating good things like food with the humans in the household. The puppy should have a limited time, probably 20 minutes, to finish its food., Watching your puppy eat is a good way to gauge his health. If he seems uninterested in his food all of a sudden, take note of it. The behavior may be due to a simple food preference issue, but it could also be a medical concern.


It's your job to notice any change in his behavior. Follow through with a call to your veterinarian, and take the proper steps to uncover the cause of the change.

, It may be tempting, but remember that human food can make your dog unhealthily obese. Alongside the serious health risk, feeding your dogs table scraps can train them to beg — one of the hardest habits to break.


To ensure good health, feed your dog food specifically designed for him.
Ignore him completely while you're eating at the table.
Check with your veterinarian about “people” foods that are safe for dogs. These might include roasted chicken breast or fresh green beans.
Foods high in fats can cause problems like pancreatitis in dogs.

, Your puppy’s body is very different from yours. Some of the foods you are able to digest are dangerously toxic to him. If your puppy eats something toxic, call the Animal Poison Control Center immediately (888-426-4435 in the US) and your veterinarian. A partial list of foods of such foods includes:


Raisins
Grapes
Xylitol (a sweetener)
Tea
Alcohol
Garlic
Onions
Avocados
Salt
Chocolate

, Unlike food, you should leave a full bowl of fresh water out for your pets at all times. Be aware that your puppy will have to urinate shortly after drinking a large amount of water. Take him to your fenced backyard on a leash so he doesn't have accidents in your house.

, An unsafe or dirty environment can be harmful to his overall well-being and can cost you a lot of money in veterinary bills.


Wash dirty bedding right away. House-train your puppy, and replace bedding ASAP if you find urine or feces.
Get rid of harmful plants. There are many common plants that are toxic to puppies who like to chew. Keep lily of the valley, oleander, azalea, yew, foxglove, rhododendron, rhubarb, and shamrock far away from your puppy. Refer to this list from the ASPCA to learn more about which plants are safe for your home when you have pets: https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/animal-poison-control/toxic-and-non-toxic-plants


, Different breeds need varying amounts of exercise. (This is a factor you should consider when choosing a puppy). Take your puppy into the yard or garden on a leash after meals to explore and get a little exercise. Begin taking him on short walks outside the yard when your veterinarian says it is safe. It is normal for puppies to have short bursts of energy followed by long naps.


While your puppy's body is still developing, avoid rough play and strenuous exercise. Save long (over one mile) runs until he's at least 9 months old.
Give your puppy about an hour of walk-time a day, broken into two to four walks. Allow him to interact with other (friendly) dogs he meets. (Do this only once your puppy has finished his vaccination series).

, Once you have a few options, visit each clinic to see which one you like best. Choose a clinic that is friendly, well managed, and smells clean. Ask questions to the vet and the staff—they should always answer to the best of their ability. Be sure you feel comfortable with whichever vet you choose.

, When he's six to nine weeks old, take him to the vet to begin his vaccination series. Talk to the vet about distemper, parainfluenza, canine hepatitis, and parvovirus. They may have suggestions for other important vaccines as well, depending on the risks of your particular dog and your specific area.


Make sure to talk about deworming medication during your first vet visit. The veterinarian may recommend deworming for routine parasites like roundworms right away. Or, he or she may want to get a stool sample for fecal analysis to verify parasites before prescribing medication.
Deworming is a good idea not only for your puppy's health but also for your own. Many of the parasites that infect your puppy can be passed to humans and cause health problems in your family.
After your first visit, return to the vet for a rabies vaccination when your puppy is 12 to 16 weeks old. Ask your veterinarian about the recommended (and legally required) rabies vaccination protocol for your area.

, The prime socialization period for puppies is from seven to 16 weeks of age. You should strongly consider puppy preschool to acclimate him to other dogs before that period runs out.Puppy preschools provide safe, supervised play for puppies still finishing their vaccination series. Most puppies have completed their distemper/parvo series of vaccines by the age of 16 weeks.

, Talk to your veterinarian about their recommendations for the timing of-of the surgery. Vets usually recommend waiting until after the vaccines, but there may be other considerations.


For instance, spay procedures are more complex and expensive for larger breeds. The vet may recommend spaying before she reaches 50 or 60 pounds if your dog is particularly large.
Spay female dogs before their first heat cycle. This reduces the risk of pyometra, ovarian cancer, and mammary tumors., Bring treats and toys to vet appointments to teach your puppy to enjoy (or at least tolerate) the experience. Before his first checkup, introduce your puppy to having his feet, tail, and face touched. That way, it won't be so strange for him when the vet inspects him.

, The eyes should be bright, and the eyes and nostrils should be free of discharge. The puppy's coat should be clean and shiny; watch out formatting or thinning. Check your pup for bumps, inflammation, or rashes on the skin, as well as signs of diarrhea around the tail.

, Brushing keeps your pet clean and healthy and allows you to check his skin and fur for problems. Brush type and other washing and grooming requirements vary by breed. Check with your veterinarian, groomer or breeder for more information.


Brush all over the puppy, including his belly and hind legs.
Start when your puppy is young so that he isn't afraid of the brush.
Start in short lessons, using treats and toys. Brush him for only a few minutes at a time at first to avoid overwhelming him.
Do not brush the face and legs with instruments that may cause pain.

, Ask your veterinarian or groomer to show you the proper nail-cutting technique. Improper technique can hurt your puppy if you cut into the quick of his nail. This is especially important if your puppy has black nails that make it hard to spot the quick.


Nails that are too long can cause strain to your dog's wrists, as well as damage floors, furniture, and possibly people.
Plan to trim your puppy's nails every two to four weeks unless directed otherwise by your vet.
Use treats and praise, and start with only trimming a few at a time to avoid overwhelming him.

, Chew toys help a puppy keep his teeth healthy. Toothbrushes and toothpaste made specifically for dogs are also helpful in keeping your pup's teeth clean and healthy. Acclimate your puppy to having his teeth brushed slowly so that it is a positive experience for him.Don’t forget to shower him with treats and praise!

, Washing more than necessary can dry out your dog's skin and strip important oils from his coat. Gradually introduce your puppy to water and the process of getting bathed. Give him treats and praise, as always.

, Start this process the first day you bring your puppy home. The longer you wait, the more mess you'll have to deal with, and the harder it will be to train your dog. Consider using training pads for the first few days. While these should not replace taking him outside, they're useful as an intermediate stage. Consider them especially if you don't have a backyard.


Remember that a puppy has a tiny bladder and may need to go outside as frequently as every 30 minutes.
Confine the puppy with the newspapers or training pads in the exercise pen when unsupervised.
Don't let him wander the house. If you are not playing with him, place him in his crate or exercise pen, or tether him to your belt or sitting area.
Pay attention to cues that he needs to eliminate, and take him outside immediately. Take him to the same spot each time.
Praise (and treat) him immediately for using the outdoors!

, Crate training is helpful for many reasons. It curbs destructive behavior, allowing you to sleep and leave your dog alone without worrying. It is also an effective method of potty training (when used correctly).

, A well-mannered dog is a joy to have in the family. Start out on the right paw by teaching good habits early, and you and your pet will have a better relationship. It's harder to break bad habits than to create good ones in the first place.



Teach your dog to come.

Teach your dog to sit.

Teach your dog to lie down.

, Take your puppy on regular car rides to get him used to travel with you. Otherwise, the car ride can cause anxiety. If your puppy gets carsick, talk to your veterinarian about medication to manage nausea. This will make the ride more pleasant for both of you.


Make sure your dog is secured in the car. Consider a dog car seat, safety harness, barrier, or crate to avoid accidents and keep your dog safe.Remember to never leave your dog in the car on cold or warm days. The temperature inside a car can rise rapidly on warm or hot days, endangering your dog's life. On an 85°F (29.4°C) day, the temperature inside a car can rise to 102°F (39°C) within 10 minutes, even with the windows cracked. If it is too cold outside, dogs can freeze when left in the car.

, This will help you better train your dog, of course. But it will also socialize him, helping him learn how to act around unfamiliar dogs and people.

Use breed standards to assess the puppy.,
Request a health report.,
Visit puppies and parents.,
Select a pug from the litter.,
Take the pug puppy home for a trial.",How to Choose a Pug1," While some of the height and weight averages are not necessarily applicable for pug puppies, other parts of the American Kennel Club standard for pugs may be helpful when choosing a puppy. Use these standards to feel confident in selecting a puppy who is truly a pure-bred and will grow to be healthy. The pug's coat should be shiny and dense. Accepted pug coloring is full black or fawn, and fawn-colored pugs should have a fully black face mask (muzzle and area around the eyes)., An ethical breeder should have puppies wormed and vaccinated prior to sale. Before you purchase a pug puppy, ask for a report detailing all of their visits to the veterinarian, vaccinations, any past health issues and treatments they received, and providing timelines for upcoming vaccinations., See a new litter of puppies at several different points. You’ll want to watch the personality of the puppies as they grow, make sure the breeder is socializing them properly, and get to know the puppies and their parents. Watch how the pug puppies grow and interact with each other, the dam (mother), and with people. This will help you choose a friendly, healthy dog when the time comes., Once the puppies have reached the age where you can take one home, it’s time to decide which pug is right for you and your family. Each puppy will have a unique personality, but there are a number of behaviors you can look for to help you choose the right pug for you. When it comes to making a choice from a litter of puppies, there are three main dog personalities: curious, cautious, and shy.


The curious investigator pug is typically the first one to be chosen. This puppy comes right up to you when you arrive. They typically make the best dog for a family. They’ve been socialized and are not scared of or intimidated by new people or situations.
The timid, cautious pug is a great option for a family with at least one adult in the home for most of the day. As puppies, timid pugs don’t run up and greet you, but they don’t shy away either. They observe and approach when they feel comfortable. If you have the time to invest, these dogs will socialize quickly and make a great family member, though they typically show loyalty to the person who spends the most time with them.
Shy and fearful pugs are not for everyone, but they still deserve a loving home. If you have extra time to spend with them, want a companion you can take everywhere, and don’t have young children in the home, this could be the perfect dog for you. A naturally affectionate breed, once a shy pug gets used to a new owner, it will follow you wherever you go and is a great lap dog. Shy or fearful pugs are perfect for retirees and people who work from home., Most purchase contracts allow for the pug to be housed with you for a period of time, typically between 3 days and week. This trial period allows you to make sure the dog you met at the breeder’s home or adoption center is the same when it comes to interacting with you, your family, and your home. If returned before the trial period expires, you should expect to receive a full or partial refund. Review your purchase contract before taking the pug home with you, and ask for a trial period agreement if there is not one in the contract."

Decide if an active dog is right for you.,
Consider the benefits of an exercise partner.,
Think about age.,
Think about temperament.,
Consider the benefits of having a companion.,
Consider breed-specific health problems.,
Don’t forget grooming obligations.",How to Choose an Active Dog1," Active dogs are high energy and need lots of time, dedication, and training. They need at least half an hour of aerobic exercise each day. They also need access to spaces where they can exercise such as trails, dog parks, and a fenced-in backyard. If you choose an active breed, make sure you have enough time, energy, and space to dedicate to your new family member., Having an active dog means you will need to make sure it gets out each day for some intense exercise. Active breeds need at least 30 minutes of intense exercise each day like hiking, running, rollerblading, fly ball, or Frisbee. This is great for individuals who want someone to go with them on their morning run or evening hike.

, Before adopting, think about your age as well as the age of the dog you will bring into your family. Adopting an active puppy means dedicated training and lots of energy on your end. An older active dog will also need lots of your energy. An older dog that is already trained might be a good choice if you don’t have a lot of time for training., Before choosing an active dog, research the personalities and temperaments of specific breeds. For example, if you have children you will want to choose a breed that is calm, friendly, and good with kids. If you live in a crowded apartment building, don't choose a breed that barks frequently.

, Choosing an active dog can have immense benefits for your daily life. Not only will you have someone to take on your evening run, you will also have a trusty companion by your side each day. Adopting an active dog means you’ll have a canine partner that will add joy, love, and adventure to your life.

, There are certain dog breeds that are genetically prone to health conditions. Research breed-specific health problems before you choose a breed. Owning a dog is a lifelong commitment. Many health conditions can turn into big vet bills.

, Before you decide on an active dog, consider the grooming requirements of specific breeds. For example, an Australian Shepherd’s coat will need regular brushing and grooming. A shorthaired active dog, on the other hand, might require much less of your time and energy in the grooming arena. Make sure you consider the cost of grooming, too. Regular haircuts can be costly."

Pay for your puppy and take it home.",How to Choose a Jack Russell Puppy," You should know what you will be getting into when you decide to adopt a Jack Russell, to make sure the breed and your lifestyle are suitably matched.


Jack Russell Terriers tend to believe they are a lot bigger than they actually are. This means that they may tend to take on dogs that are bigger than them.
Jack Russells can be more prone to aggression than other breeds because instinctively they attack, rather than back down, when frightened.
They are one of the most enjoyable, intelligent, and stimulating breeds you could hope for; however, they are working dogs and very energetic, requiring lots of stimulation mentally and physically. This is not a good dog for an apartment or if you are gone for long periods of time.
The Jack Russell Terrier is a willful breed that is going to need a lot of training. Your puppy will require training from the very beginning, especially with learning not to snip, to be patient and stay still or relaxed, and to listen and obey. Your household must be ready for the tornado to descend, so to speak.
They also have a very high prey drive and do not make good pets in a household with cats or other small mammals, as they will chase and harm the other pets.
Jack Russell Terriers need to be occupied or they will get into trouble. They do well with any activity, including agility competitions, dog shows, obedience training, tracking, flyball, or disc sports.
They are great companions and tend to be good with children as long as the children treat the dog well, as they are not very patient with mishandling.;
, The animal's disposition should be fearless and happy. A Jack Russell should be confident, but not overly aggressive. Consider those that appear happy, energetic and bold, without being a bully or picking on their litter mates.Traits undesirable in a Jack Russell Terrier include nervousness and cowering, as they will be more likely to bite when they are scared and they will not be suited for companionship or athleticism.Avoid puppies that appear disinterested, sluggish, or weak, as these could be signs of unhealthiness.

, If the puppy is very excited and responsive to all members of your household, then it will likely be a good match. There is something to be said for dogs picking their owners, just as much as owners pick their dogs.


If the puppy doesn’t come to you, even when encouraged, it may not be the right one for you.

, Even as a puppy, the Jack Russell's height and length should be in proportion with one another, and the dog should appear well-balanced. Jack Russell Terriers are slightly longer than they are tall.


Avoid those that are thinly muscled, bony, or have a potbelly appearance, as these can be signs of a medical issue or malnutrition.
They are usually 10 to 12 inches tall and generally weigh between 12 and 15 pounds. Some are smaller or larger, depending on how they are bred, or if they are mixed with another breed., According to breed standard, the Jack Russell's head should be of medium width at the ear, narrow slightly at the eyes, and flare out again at the muzzle.The dog's nose should be black and his jaw should have strong cheek muscles. The puppy's eyes should be dark brown to black and almond-shaped.
The ears fall forward close to the dog's head and are v-shaped. Their ears should be very mobile, coming forward and together when the dog’s head is alert. (Puppy’s ears get more mobile as they get older, so you may not see much in the movement of the ears at a very young age.)
The top jaw should overlap the lower jaw slightly, but with the bottom puppy canines being in front of the upper canines when the mouth is fully closed. The rear chewing teeth of the upper jaw should line up and be just outside the chewing teeth of the lower jaw.

, Be sure the puppy's neck has clean, muscular lines and widens gradually at the shoulders, which should slope. The front legs must be straight and strong with the joints aligned.


Jack Russells were originally bred for fox hunting, to go into the fox’s den and root them out. They were bred to be fearless hunters and to have a very muscular, lithe body perfect for getting into tight quarters.The puppy should have a chest that is longer than it is wide, with a body that appears generally athletic.
Check for a straight, strong back and a loin (lower back from the back of the ribs to the upper part of the rump) that is short and well-muscled.

, The hocks, which are the joints at the back of the rear legs, should be straight from the joint to the back of the foot. From the rear, the Jack Russell should present a strong, muscular appearance, with well-rounded buttocks and thighs.


The feet should point straight forward (turning neither in nor out), and should be round and well-padded.
The tail should be about 4 inches (10.2 cm) long, carried merrily and set high on the hindquarters. If docked, the tail will be on the same level as the ears. The tail may droop at rest, but will be erect when moving., If the animal is smooth-coated, make sure there are no thin spots. Rough or broken-coated Jack Russell should not appear woolly. The coat should be at least 70 percent white. Acceptable colors for markings are tan, black or brown, but not brindle.


If the puppy’s coat is dry and flaky, doesn’t return to its normal position when pinched up at the neck, or is overall thin or with thin areas, it may have a medical issue.

, Its gait should be well-coordinated and lively. Many young puppies will be clumsy and fall over, a little more hesitant about heights or new objects, and oftentimes their head will be heavier than their back end when they are eating and drinking.


However, puppies should not have any limbs that don’t move forward and back correctly, should not fall over during normal walking, and should not have tremors to their head and neck when trying to eat or drink. These can be signs of neurologic disease in the puppy.

, There are unfortunately more ‘bad’ breeders out there (breed bad genetics, puppy mills that breed for money, breed because they didn’t spay or neuter their animals appropriately, etc.) than good ones.


If you are going to a breeder, ask for references they can talk to of other people who have bought from them. Talk to owners of other litters. If the breeder has no references to give you, you will likely not want to buy from them.
More importantly, ask who their veterinarian is. If the breeder doesn’t have a good relationship with a veterinarian, there may be problems with the breeders practices.

, You should begin by asking about the pedigree of the dog and what kind of registration papers you will get if you adopt a dog from them.


Is the puppy with its mother and father? Make sure the two are in no way related to each other.

, How well the puppy is socialized in the early stages will make a significant difference on how well it is going to get along in your household and the world around it.


It can be beneficial to ask the breeder what other animals they have been exposed to and how they did with those species. Does the breeder have other dogs and other types of animals? Does the breeder have small children? What did the puppy do and how did it act during those interactions?It's important to socialize this breed in order to decrease prey drive, especially if you have other types of animals in your home or live on a farm. The majority of socialization that makes a lasting impression happens in the 8 to 16 week range, with the peak socialization period being around 12 weeks.
They also go through another stage at puberty (6 to 9 months) and at social maturity (18 to 24 months), where it is important to monitor your puppy and correct inappropriate behavior before it becomes a consistent part of their personality., Make note of the surroundings. Get your best impression of the property, grounds and the breeder to make sure you are not at a ‘puppy mill.’


Is the puppy’s area clean? The grounds and the puppy’s areas should be cleaned and well maintained, should not smell, and there should not be any soft stool or diarrhea anywhere. Any of this could signal the puppies have not been taken care of properly and may have intestinal parasites.
Meet both the mother and father and note how they look and act towards you, your other family members and other animals. Ask the breeder about the mother and father, including health, personality and socialization. Aggression personality traits can be passed on to the offspring.

, Many work with puppy mills). If you get a puppy from a shelter or rescue you may have no idea about it's past.

, Have a return policy set up with wherever you buy from, and take the puppy to a veterinarian for a checkup as soon as possible, to make sure the puppy is healthy and to start the vaccination protocols. Depending on the age of your puppy, it will be getting vaccines every 2 to 4 weeks until it is 4 months old.The typical price range for a Jack Russell puppy from a reputable breeder is $350 to $600.

Learn the breed standard.,
Recognize common health concerns.,
Request a health history.,
Assess the pug's personality.,
Train adult pugs with a firm hand.",How to Choose a Pug2," While you may not be interested in breeding or showing your pug through the American Kennel Club, or comparable organizations in other countries, these standards were put in place to help describe the healthiest dogs in the breed. Choosing a pug that meets the breed standard is the best way to ensure you’re selecting a dog who will lead a long, happy life as part of your family.


From the tip of the shoulder to the floor, pugs stand between 10 and 12 inches.
The length of the pug from breastbone to tailbone should be equal to the height from the shoulder.
A healthy adult pug should weigh between 15 and 20 pounds depending on height.The coat should be smooth, soft, and shiny. The pug standard allows for full black and fawn colored with a dark face, but there are rare silver and white varieties.
The gait when walking or running should be even with a slight roll to the hips and back end. The pug should hold its head high and appear jaunty., Unfortunately, pugs are prone to a number of chronic diseases, and it’s important to check for warning signs of these illnesses before choosing a dog. Some of the most common diseases include hip dysplasia, obesity, arthritis, melanoma, and breathing concerns like atopy.Check the eyes for watering, a glaze or film over the pupils, and squinting.
Listen for signs of rasping or wheezing when the dog breathes. Make sure the pug is breathing through both the nose and mouth.
Watch the dog walk looking for signs of limping or uneven gait. Also, listen for clicking or grinding sounds when the dog walks., Any past or current conditions, vaccination schedules, and ongoing treatments should be provided before you purchase an adult pug. You should also ask for health history of the dog's parents as this can be indicative of future illnesses., If you decide to adopt a fully-grown pug, you'll be able to see exactly what the pug will look like and get to know their personality. Spending time with an adult pug before purchasing or adopting it will give you a good idea what type of personality the pug has. Ask for a trial period, so you can take the pug home to see how it interacts with your family, home, and other pets. Also, make sure to gather as much information as possible about past behaviors before buying the pug.


Ask if the dog has ever bitten a person, fought with other animals, or otherwise demonstrated aggressive behavior.
Ask if the dog is house trained.
Ask about past behavioral issues like chewing furniture and excessive barking., As the saying goes, you can’t teach an old dog new tricks, but this intelligent breed may be the exception that makes that rule. With persistence, even a fully grown pug can and will learn new things. The key is to be consistent in your training."

Find reputable breeders.,
Review purchase contracts.,
Learn fair pricing.,
Rescue a pug.,
Adopt a pug.",How to Choose a Pug3," It’s important to purchase your pug from a litter that has been well cared for. You don’t want to support breeders who force dogs to mate too frequently, have a number of dogs in a small area, or otherwise mistreat their pugs. While these puppies need good homes, giving unethical breeders money perpetuates the cycle. Instead, look for breeders who treat their dogs well and have clean, abundant facilities for their breeding pairs and puppies.


If a breeder is willing to answer questions, let you visit often, and provides a fair and complete purchase contract, you are likely dealing with an ethical breeder.
If a breeder avoids answering questions, won’t let you visit, requires a cash deposit before you can view puppies, or seems uninterested in how you will care for the puppy, you are likely dealing with an unethical breeder.Consider reporting unethical breeding to the Pug Dog Club of America Rescue Committee. They will be able to visit the breeder and determine whether intervention is necessary., It’s important to have all the facts in writing before making any large investment and that includes purchasing your new pug puppy. Most purchase contracts include the cost of the dog, refund and return policies, a trial period agreement, health history of the puppy and parents, and at least three generations of pedigree information. You can ask for the contract to include any other information you deem necessary, so don’t hesitate to ask for more information., The cost of purchasing a full-bred pug puppy will vary dramatically between breeders for a number of reasons, but typically puppies will cost between $500 and $2000. This is based on a number of things including quality of the dog, pedigree, and general supply and demand.


A “pet quality” pug puppy will be less expensive than a “show quality” pug puppy. Pugs who will be able to win at AKC recognized dog shows will be sold for more money than those who do not show signs of being show quality.
Dogs whose pedigree is exceptionally good will also be more costly. You should request at least three generations of pedigree to be included in the purchase contract of the pug. Puppies whose pedigree includes numerous champions or other AKC recognized dogs will likely be more expensive.
Traditional economics like supply and demand also play a major role in determining the pricing. If the breeder has a waiting list of people who would like to purchase their puppies, they are able to ask more money for each one., There are a number of organizations worldwide whose purpose is to find homes for pugs, and these dogs deserve good, safe, loving homes. Start by visiting the Pug Dog Club of America at www.pugdogclubofamerica.com. This organization offers a full list of pug adoption centers and rescues that provide quality puppies and dogs. Adoption also saves money as the new owner is typically only required to pay a fee between $50 and $100., Many local animal shelters also need to find homes for pugs. If you know you want a pug, reach reach out to local animal shelters. In many areas, the shelter will contact you if a pug becomes available. You can also use the ASPCA's pet adoption tool found at http://www.aspca.org/adopt-pet to find a pug near you. Perhaps more than any other pug, those who are in local shelters may be most in need of a new home and family. Due to overcrowding, most local shelters have to euthanize dogs that are not promptly adopted.

Find a reputable dog breeder.,
Meet the dog.,
Bring your new companion home.",How to Choose an Active Dog3," Before you buy a dog from a breeder, consider adopting from the humane society, your local shelter, or a breed-specific dog rescue organization. Adopting a dog will save you money, and often you will be saving the dog’s life. Give adoption some thought before making a decision to buy a puppy from a breeder., Before deciding to buy a dog from a breeder, visit some local animal shelters. Most municipalities have many animal shelters. Some of these may be no-kill facilities, but many will euthanize dogs that are not adopted. Visit several shelters in person and online to see if you can find a dog that fits your lifestyle and desires., If you want to adopt a specific breed, make contact with a breed specific rescue network or organization. The American Kennel Club, for example, has more than 400 rescue network groups in the United States., If you make the decision to not adopt from a shelter or dog rescue organization, seek out a reputable breeder. Make sure you have reliable referrals from others who have worked with the breeder.

If you get too close to the puppy, it might bite you, especially if it is frightened or in a lot of pain.;
, If the puppy does not seem aggressive or dangerous, speak calmly and move slowly as you get close to the puppy.Sudden movements might spook the animal.


If you have some kind of food or dog treats available to you, try to show the pup that you mean no harm to it by offering up the treats or food as a gift., While this might not be necessary, some puppies will snap or bite if they feel scared or threatened. You can gently and carefully put a muzzle over its snout to keep it from biting you while you help it. Only try this if you feel it is necessary for you to stay safe. This only works for a long-snouted dog and won't work for a flat-faced breed like a pug.


Be sure that the puppy is not vomiting before trying to muzzle it; if it vomits with a muzzle on it could choke.
You can use a strip of towel, gauze, a knee high sock, or panty hose to gently tie the dog's muzzle shut., Some injuries require immediate emergency care, and other injuries are less severe and you can care for them yourself. While there may be internal injuries that you can't see, you can try to evaluate the situation and determine what you should do next based on how the puppy looks and acts.


If you see lots of blood, or if the puppy is actively losing lots of blood, it might be an emergency situation. A puppy that simply has a skin condition such as mange will still need medical care, but it may not be an emergency.
A puppy that is easily moving around is less severely injured than if it is lying on the ground whimpering. Try to figure out if the animal can or should walk, or if it needs to be carried.

, If there is a broken bone or an open wound and you have a first aid kit, consider trying to stabilize the injury with a homemade splint, gauze pads or wrappings until you can get to the vet.If you don't have a first aid kit, you can use your own clean shirt, a towel, a blanket, or anything else that is clean and handy.


Check out this helpful wikiHow article for more information on splinting a dog's leg.
Use a clean rag or cloth to apply pressure to any bleeding, open wound. This will help to stop the bleeding until you can get help from a vet.

, If the dog can walk, lead it to your car and place it into the back seat. If the dog’s injuries are too severe, you will need to pick up the dog. In this case, try to wrap the puppy in a towel, blanket, or shirt before you pick it up and be sure to keep your face away from its mouth to protect you from bites. Move quickly and carefully, and try not to move the dog too much because you could make its injuries worse.The dog might be frightened while you move it, so speak in a calm, soothing voice to reassure it.
If it’s a small puppy, consider placing it in a cardboard box or pet carrier. This can help keep it safe while you drive. Otherwise, ask someone to come with you and have them hold the puppy wrapped in a towel or blanket.

, This will allow you to speak to a professional about the dog’s injuries and to get advice on how to get the puppy to the clinic for treatment. This will also ensure that the clinic is ready for you when you arrive with the injured puppy.Try to describe the dog's size in pounds, approximate age if you can guess, and what you think its injuries might be. For instance, the puppy may have been hit by a car, attacked by a bigger dog, or may seem to have mange or a severe case of flea or tick infestation.

, If you cannot afford to take the injured puppy to the vet, try calling your local animal control or animal welfare department. These groups can usually help, or direct you to other groups who can. You can call them directly, or call your local police department's non-emergency number for more information.


This is usually easiest during business hours on weekdays, but don't give up if you can't get ahold of someone. If you live in a major city, search online for rescue groups. If the puppy looks to be a particular breed (or a mix containing a particular breed), search online for breed-specific rescue groups in your city or state (for instance, the Boxer Rescue of Oklahoma).
You can also try using Facebook or other social media outlets to find help for the injured puppy. Many cities have pet lost and found groups or animal rescue groups, and members are often willing to help rescue injured dogs or even pitch in for veterinary bills. Search Facebook for ""dog rescue"" and the name of your city. If you have a big social network, share a picture of the puppy and a plea for help, and ask your friends to share your post.

, You should be aware that when you take the puppy to the clinic, you will have to pay for its treatment.If the dog has extensive injuries, the bill might be quite high. However, if the dog has moderate to severe injuries, veterinary aid is a necessary part of caring for the dog.

, Tell the vet that you do not know the puppy's age or medical history, how long it has been a stray, the last time it ate or drank, or the last time it received any care for its injuries. This will let the vet know that they need to make a complete examination of the dog for its overall health and wellbeing, in addition to caring for the puppy’s injuries. In addition to assessing the pup's injuries, the vet will probably test for:Parvovirus
Ringworm fungus
Bacterial Dermatitis
Mange
Internal parasites, such as worms
Ticks and fleas
Ear mites

, Some veterinary clinics will provide free services to stray animals, but in order to receive these services, you are expected to give up all rights and knowledge of the animal you’ve found.This means that you cannot wait with the animal while it is being treated, or call the veterinary office for updates.


If you do not have the funds to care for the dog, or if you are not attached to the pup, this might be a good option if it is available to you.

, In an event where you’re seeing an injured animal in pain, it is easy to forget that the vet is specially trained to handle these situations. The vet does not need your questions, advice, or help, and offering these things will only slow the vet down and make it take longer for the dog to receive necessary treatment.


In the event of serious injury, the vet might suggest euthanasia.Be sure to listen to what they have to say, ask for alternative treatment plans, and consider the level of discomfort the dog is experiencing and it’s likelihood of recovery.When in doubt trust your vet’s recommendations.

, The vet may recommend applying a certain medicated ointment or administering oral medications depending on the puppy's injury. Be sure to follow any directions that the vet gives, and don't miss any doses.


Some medications like antibiotics or skin creams have to be administered even after the symptoms of illness or injury have passed. Be sure to use the full course of medication, and don't skip any doses.

, If you are going to try to nurse the puppy back to health, you want to be sure it is clean before bringing it into your home.


You can't use a flea or tick shampoo on a puppy younger than 12 weeks or so, but some veterinarians recommend using liquid dish soap such as blue Dawn to remove dirt and grease from the puppy's fur. If the puppy has ticks, pull them off at the head using a pair of tweezers and flush them down the toilet or smash them before discarding.

, Puppies that are six weeks or less need lots of warmth, since they are used to cuddling up with their mother and littermates.


A pet crate with a few towels or baby blankets inside will serve as a warm place for him or her to get some rest while recovering from their injuries.

, Puppies' diets vary based on their age, so it is important to ask the vet for an estimate on how old the puppy might be and what the vet recommends for it to eat.


A very young puppy will need to be bottle fed using a special puppy formula, but puppies can eat dry puppy food starting at around five weeks of age. You can get the proper food at your local pet store.
Ask the vet if he or she recommends a special diet while the puppy recovers. Sometimes a critically ill or injured dog will need a critical care diet, which is easier to digest and more calorie-dense for a dog who has a lower appetite due to illness., For example, a seven week old, seven pound puppy will need to eat about half a cup of dry puppy food three times a day.


Always have a bowl of clean, cool water available for your puppy.

, It is possible that the puppy managed to escape from its home and that its owner is looking for it.


If the dog does have a microchip, make sure that you contact the owner. Sometimes the vet will offer to board the puppy until its owner can pick it up.

, If the puppy has no tags, nor a microchip, and you are unable to keep it, take it to a local animal shelter. Taking a stray animal to the shelter is still the quickest way to reunite a lost pet with its owner., If you choose to keep the puppy while you search for its owner, post fliers of the dog along with your contact information in heavily trafficked areas of your town. These fliers might help to reunite the owner with the puppy. Here are some places you might post fliers:Grocery Stores
Veterinarian Offices
Humane Society
Local Animal Shelters
Telephone poles at busy intersections
College Campuses
Social media sites, like Facebook or Nextdoor

, If someone contacts you stating that they are the owner of the puppy, ask questions to make sure this is true. You might even ask for proof of ownership, such as pictures of the pup, the dog’s ID tags, vet records, or an adoption contract.You should also offer to personally deliver the puppy to the owner’s home so that you can make sure that the pup is well cared for and lives in a loving home.

, If you are unable to locate the owner of the puppy, you may choose to adopt the dog. In order to adopt the puppy as your own, you need to check the laws for dog ownership in your city or state.]


In some areas, you will need to contact the animal control agency or the humane society to report finding the animal, prove that you’ve made a reasonable attempt to find the owner of the dog, and demonstrate that you want to adopt the puppy.
You will need to get the puppy vaccinated, licensed, and microchipped. You should also get a collar with ID tags for the puppy.[

Adopt a dog that fits your lifestyle.,
Consider the dog’s age.,
Beware of health issues.,
Think about grooming and maintenance.",How to Choose a Laid‐Back Dog1," Before you adopt a dog, you should think about where you live and how much time you have to spend with the dog. For example, a large breed like a Great Dane might not be the best choice if you live in a small apartment. You should also consider how much time you can spend with the dog. Even a laid back toy breed needs a walk every day!, Think about whether your family will be better suited to an older dog, an adolescent, or a puppy. Many older dogs are in need of loving homes and are often already trained. Puppies need extensive time, dedication, and training., Before you adopt a laid-back dog, you should research potential health issues that are common in certain breeds. These issues can quickly turn into hefty vet bills and stressful situations. Owning a dog a lifelong commitment, whether your dog is sick or healthy.

, Different breeds need different types of maintenance. A short haired dog might not need grooming beyond the occasional bath and a weekly brushing. A long haired dog, like a Shih Tzu, will need more intensive grooming on a regular basis. Consider the cost and time required for grooming a dog before deciding on a breed."

Seek and follow your vet’s treatment advice.,
Select a pancreatic enzyme powder supplement.,
Mix the powder in with your German Shepherd’s food.,
Observe an improvement in clinical signs.,
Ask your vet about giving your German Shepherd an antacid.,
Use fresh pancreas with caution.",How to Treat Pancreatic Enzyme Deficiencies in German Shepherds1," To diagnose EPI, your vet will perform a blood test called the serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI) test. If the test results indicate EPI, your vet will recommend adding a pancreatic enzyme supplement to your German Shepherd’s diet.Enzyme supplementation is the treatment of choice for EPI and will give your German Shepherd the best chance of getting better.


Trypsin is a digestive enzyme produced by the pancreas. The TLI test measures trypsin and trypsinogen, the inactive form of trypsin that gets converted to trypsin. Low levels of each substance indicate EPI.;
, Pancreatic enzyme supplements come in powder and tablet formulations. However, the concentration of pancreatic enzyme is higher in the powder than the tablets, making the powder the preferred choice.Also, enzyme tablets do not get broken down consistently once they reach the stomach, so they may not give your German Shepherd enough enzyme to get better.Gel-coated capsules filled with the enzyme powder are also available, but they are not very effective.Viokase-V is the name of the powder enzyme supplement.It is a prescription medication, so you will need to purchase it through your vet.

, The dose of the powder enzyme supplement is 1 teaspoon/40 pounds (20 kilograms) of body weight. Add this amount to your German Shepherd’s food. Since the powder is abrasive and can lead to ulcerations on the inside of your German Shepherd’s mouth, mix the powder in really well.Mix the powder in with your German Shepherd’s food at each meal time.You do not need to warm up the powder with the food. If your dog eats only dry food, add a little bit of water to the food so you can mix in the powder more easily., Common signs of EPI in a German Shepherd are weight loss (despite a normal or increased appetite) and large volumes of soft, yellow-looking feces.Your German Shepherd should start to improve within the first week of treatment with the enzyme powder. Be aware that, even if your German Shepherds regains some weight, it may not gain back all of the lost weight.As your German Shepherd’s symptoms improve, your vet will reduce the dose of enzyme powder. Eventually, your vet will prescribe the lowest dose of enzyme powder that will still be effective.Treatment for EPI is lifelong.Even though you will see improvement soon after your German Shepherd starts treatment, you will need to continue treating your dog for the rest of its life.

, When your German Shepherd eats the enzyme powder at mealtime, a large amount of the enzyme gets digested in the stomach. Fortunately, enough of the enzyme remains to effectively treat EPI. Antacids have been recommended as a way to prevent stomach acid from breaking down the digestive enzyme. However, antacids have not shown clear benefit in EPI, so your vet may not recommend them., Pancreatic enzyme powder is expensive. If lifelong treatment with the powder strains your budget, consider the less expensive option: fresh, raw pancreas that comes from either a pig or cow. Because of the risk of disease transmission with raw foods, the fresh pancreas should come from animals that are certified to be free of transmissible disease (disease that can be transferred between animals).1‒3 ounces of fresh pancreas is roughly equivalent to 1 teaspoon of enzyme powder.To make sure you add the appropriate amount to your German Shepherd’s food, purchase a food scale.
Do not cook the pancreas, since cooking would inactivate the digestive enzymes your German Shepherd needs.Fresh pancreas can be frozen for up to several months without any loss of digestive enzymes. Also, you do not need to warm up the pancreas with your German Shepherd’s food.Talk to your vet about where you can obtain safe, fresh pancreas. However, if you are concerned about the risk of disease, continue with the powder enzyme supplement.

Decide what size of dog you would like.,
Figure out what your dog's personality should be like.,
Do research on potential breeds.,
Discuss breeds and make a decision.",How to Choose a Hypoallergenic Dog1," Once you have decided to get a hypoallergenic dog, you will need to narrow down your choice even further. Begin this narrowing by deciding what size of dog you would like.


This decision may be based on simple likes or dislikes, or it may be based on logistics, such as if you need a small breed due to space considerations.
Whatever sized dog you would like, there is probably a hypoallergenic dog that size.There are small breeds, such as the bichon frise and Maltese, that are hypoallergenic. There are large breeds that are hypoallergenic, such as the standard poodle and Afghan hound.;
, Different dog breeds have vastly different personalities and energy levels. In order to find the perfect dog breed for your family, you will need to need to figure out whether you want a dog with a lot of energy, a lap dog, a dog that can be easily trained, or a dog that is independent and spirited.


Make a list of the activities you would like to do with your dog and assess what kind of dog will be best for these activities. For example, if this list includes hiking and outdoor activities, then you will need a dog that is large enough to keep up with you on a trail and will be motivated to do energetic activities. If you want a dog to snuggle with and go for short daily walks with, then you may want a smaller lap dog.
Some hypoallergenic breeds that make good lap dogs include the Maltese and the coton de tulear. Some hypoallergenic breeds that are more active include the Irish water spaniel and the Portuguese water dog., Once you have a list of the attributes you would like in a dog, you can match that list to potential breeds. Go online and do some research into what breeds are most hypoallergenic and what their other attributes are.

Consider adoption.,
Visit local shelters.,
Contact a breed specific rescue network.,
Work with a reputable breeder.,
Meet the dog.,
Take your new dog home.",How to Choose a Laid‐Back Dog3," Before you make the decision to seek out a breeder, consider adopting a dog from a local shelter or regional dog rescue instead. Adoption is cheaper that purchasing a puppy from a breeder, and there are many dogs in need of homes., Before deciding to buy a dog from a breeder, you should visit local local animal shelters. Most municipalities have many animal shelters. While some of these may be no-kill facilities, many will euthanize dogs that are not adopted. Visit several shelters in person and online to see if you can find a dog that fits your lifestyle and desires., If you want to adopt a specific breed of dog, contact a breed specific rescue group or network. For example, the American Kennel Club has over 450 rescue network groups in the United States., If you decide that you do not want to adopt a dog, work with a reputable breeder. Seek a referral and meet the breeder in person at the facility. Inspect the conditions of the facility yourself and confirm the breeder’s credentials. Confirm the documentation of your puppy’s lineage before taking your puppy home.

, If you find a dog that might be a good fit, take a trip to meet and spend time with the dog. Involve all members of your family in this process. It is important that you also involve canine members of the family. You'll want to make sure everyone gets along! Spend an hour with the new dog.

Have your vet administer vitamin B12 injections.,
Give your German Shepherd antibiotics.,
Discuss dietary changes with your vet.",How to Treat Pancreatic Enzyme Deficiencies in German Shepherds2," In addition to causing an enzyme deficiency, EPI can lead to a deficiency of vitamin B12 (also known as cobalamin). This deficiency occurs when there is a bacterial overgrowth in the gut. These bacteria 'steal' the nutrients, leading to nutrient deficiencies. To correct this deficiency, your vet would first give your German Shepherd weekly vitamin B12 injections into the muscle, then give the injections every 3 months.Your vet will periodically take a blood sample to measure the amount of vitamin B12 in your German Shepherd’s blood.It is not known whether a vitamin B12 deficiency significantly affects in dogs with EPI.Your vet will determine whether vitamin B12 supplementation is necessary for your German Shepherd.

, If your German Shepherd's gut cannot properly absorb nutrients due to bacterial overgrowth, diarrhea will occur. If your German Shepherd continues to have diarrhea with pancreatic enzyme supplementation, the bacteria are probably the culprit. Your vet will prescribe an antibiotic to correct the overgrowth.Your German Shepherd may be on the antibiotic for up to 6 weeks., Since EPI decreases the ability of dog’s gut to absorb nutrients, a low-fat, highly digestible diet used to be recommended for dogs with this condition. However, a low-fat diet would make it even harder for your German Shepherd’s gut to absorb fat. This could cause deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, E, and K) and essential fatty acids (omega 3 and omega 6).A low-fiber diet may help your German Shepherd, especially if it’s not gaining weight.Most dogs with EPI do not need a dietary change.Talk with your vet before making any changes to your German Shepherd’s diet.

Look at a shelter or rescue organization.,
Contact a breeder.,
Meet potential dogs.,
Bring your new dog home.",How to Choose a Hypoallergenic Dog2," If you are concerned about pet overpopulation and the number of dogs that are homeless, then look for your dog at a shelter or through a rescue organization. They have fewer purebred dogs but you will be adopting a dog that really needs a home.It can be more difficult to determine if a rescue dog is hypoallergenic than to determine if a dog that comes from a breeder is hypoallergenic. That being said, there are some hybrid dogs that are hypoallergenic, especially dogs that are poodle mixes., If you have a specific breed in mind, then you can go through a breeder to get your dog. One way to find a reputable breeder is to look at the websites of dog groups that focus on the breed you want. They should have lists of reputable breeders that specialize in the breed you want.


Discuss the breeders practices and standards with them before committing to buying a dog from them. This will help ensure that you are paying an ethical breeder.

, Once you have identified a breeder or a rescue, you will need to meet potential dogs to see if they are a match. Since you are looking for a hypoallergenic dog in particular, this is a good time to assess if you are allergic to them or not. Spend some time with the dog and assess whether you are having an allergic reaction.If you want to make sure you are not allergic to the potential dog, you can bring a shirt or some other piece of clothing with you when you meet the dog. Rub the clothing on the dog and then wear it for awhile after the meeting. If you have an allergy attack, it is likely coming from something on the dog.
When meeting the dog you will also need to assess the dog's temperament. Make sure the dog has a good personality and is healthy before agreeing to adopt it.

, Once you have found a dog that you like and that you are not allergic to you can pay any adoption fees required and bring it home. The decision may have taken some time but will assure that you get the right hypoallergenic dog for you and your family.


There are some things you can do to even further reduce allergens on any dog. These include bathing and grooming the dog regularly, cleaning your house regularly, and changing air filters in your home regularly as well."

Assess your allergies.,
Learn about hypoallergenic dogs.,
Spend some time with a hypoallergenic dog.,
Decide if a hypoallergenic dog is right for you.",How to Choose a Hypoallergenic Dog3," If you are considering getting a hypoallergenic dog it is probably because you, or someone in your family, is allergic to dogs. When you are around dogs your eyes are watery or itchy, your nose runs, you sneeze a lot, or your skin even turns red and bumpy. In order to decide whether the allergy is severe enough to limit your dog choices, you should assess those allergies and make sure they are associated with dogs.Get allergy testing done by your physician. This testing usually consists of skin pricks and the application of small amounts of dog allergens. If you are allergic, your skin will react. This will tell you definitively whether or not you are allergic to dogs and whether you need to consider adopting only a hypoallergenic breed of dog.

, Hypoallergenic dogs are different from other dogs in that they produce less dander. No dog will be 100% hypoallergenic, meaning that it doesn't produce any allergens, but certain breeds have non-shedding coats that produce drastically less dander.Hypoallergenic breeds do not shed their coats. This means that dander, which is attached to pet hair, does not get released out into the environment as much as it would with a dog that sheds.
Hypoallergenic dogs do require a bit of work to maintain. Because they don't have shedding fur, they must be groomed routinely. Without grooming, a hypoallergenic dog's hair can get overgrown and matted.

, In order to so see if your allergies are so strong that they even emerge around a hypoallergenic dog, you should spend some time with one. If you know a friend who has one, ask to spend some time with their dog. You may even be able to contact a local dog club that focuses on a breed of hypoallergenic dogs and see if anyone will let you meet their dog.In order to really see if you are allergic to a hypoallergenic dog you will need to spend some time with them indoors. If you only hang out with one outside, you may not get the full impact they can give when in a contained space.

, Some people who are only slightly allergic to dogs can eventually adjust to any dog that they bring into their homes. However, if you are severely allergic or don't want to risk not adjusting to a dog you are allergic to, then you should likely get a hypoallergenic dog. However, it is your decision to weigh and decide on.If you are having a hard time deciding, try making a list of pros and cons. This list could include how the lack of allergens will help you, whether or not you like the looks and temperament of hypoallergenic dogs, whether you are willing to take anti-allergy medications indefinitely, and the potential cost of getting a specific breed of dog.

Choose your German Shepherd.,
Give your German Shepherd a way to keep cool.,
Teach your German Shepherd tricks.,
Remember that a German Shepherd is large.,
Feed your GSD properly.,
Bathe your shepherd if you feel they need it, but don't do this too often as it can disrupt their natural skin and fur oils.,
Take your shepherd to the vet.,
Exercise your dog.,
Love your dog.",How to Take Care of a German Shepherd," Make sure the breeder isn't abusive, and make sure your dog doesn't have any diseases so you can give them a long, happy life at your house;
, German Shepherds, especially long-haired shepherds, are susceptible to hot weather. If you have a long-haired shepherd and you live in a hot/tropical area, provide your dog with plenty of water and shade while outside, and don't demand too much of them on extremely hot days.

, Not only will a well behaved German Shepherd be more impressive and easier to care for, but you and your dog will develop a bond if you take the time to train it. As the bond gets stronger, your German Shepherd will be more likely to listen to your commands, and will be happier to have you as a master.

, Give this breed space. German Shepherds are very active, fun-loving dogs. They need a lot of space to run around. Make sure that your yard is clear, uncluttered and hazard-free. If you don't have a big yard then take your dog daily to the local park, or make use of any other appropriate open spaces accessible from your home. German Shepherd dogs get along with other dogs well.

, Make sure you feed your shepherd twice per day, and feed it the right amount. Don't give him/her too little or too much. Make sure you are feeding a quality food which doesn't use corn for protein. Dogs drink a lot. Fill up a bowl and leave it where your dog has access to it. Check up on the bowl several times a day to make sure there is plenty of water and that it is clean.

, You can bathe him/her at home or take him/her to a groomer.

, Here are some reasons to do so:




Check-up - The vet can check the general condition of your dog and give regular injections.
Bath - the vet will give your dog a proper bath to get rid of stench and check for things like ear infections.
Nails - When your dogs nails get long it is very painful for them to move about. Take him/her to the vet to have them clipped.
De-worming/heart worm test - All dogs must be wormed every month or so to prevent them getting worms. First your dog will need to be tested for worms, and then your vet can prescribe a medication to be taken monthly. If your dog already has worms, your vet can provide a medication for treatment.
Old age - This specific breed of dog gets many problems when they get old-mainly joint problems. If your dog has trouble walking, take him/her to the vet, who will give you medicine or help your German Shepherd with therapy or, in extreme cases, surgery.



, Without exercise, the German Shepherd's amazing muscles and energy will be locked up inside with no outlet. You need to exercise your German Shepherd daily by playing fetch, taking it for a long walk or run, or even chasing your dog around the yard. German Shepherds who don't get enough exercise are more likely to get joint diseases like hip and elbow dysplasia, as well as become destructive. Beware of too much exercise at young age, as this can cause the dog to develop improperly.

, This breed is loving and needs TLC back! Cuddle with your dog daily. Don't beat your dog or yell unnecessarily at it. Never scold your dog unless you catch it IN THE ACT. Otherwise the dog will associate scolding with you, not the action.


You can't fake affection, even with a dog. So you have to have expressions and gestures to prove how much you adore him/her, to make him/her feel lovable and loved. There has to be sincere and genuine love shared between the two of you and your German Shepherd.

Look for a cough.,
Watch for a lack of energy.,
Check for breathing problems.,
Look for weight loss.,
Take your dog to the vet.",How to Treat Heart Disease in German Shepherds1," The most common sign of heart disease in a German shepherd is a cough.This usually occurs at night when the animal is resting. Fluid buildup in your dog’s lungs may trigger a series of coughing fits. If your dog coughs for more than three days, you should take them to the vet.The cough is often described as similar to a smoker's cough, due to its harsh, hacking nature.;
, Your German shepherd will probably have a lack of energy, exhibit lethargy, or show signs of fatigue. Your pet may not be as energetic or lively as they used to be, and they may lie around the house or sleep more. Due to the restricted blood and oxygen circulation, your pet may tire sooner than normal.Your dog may have difficulty exercising because of restricted oxygen flow. In extreme cases, the dog may faint or pass out during exercise.

, Respiratory problems commonly occur when a dog has heart problems because the heart has difficulty pumping oxygen to the body. Your German shepherd’s heart will have to work overtime to get blood flowing.Pooling of fluid in the lungs makes gas exchange more difficult and the dog has to put in extra effort to breathe. This may look like rapid breathing at rest and exaggerated movements of the chest wall.


Some dogs may need to use their belly muscles in order to help expand the chest to help breathing.

, If the heart disease has been around for a while, many German shepherds will have a poor appetite. Your dog may refuse to eat or want to eat less food than is normal. Therefore, your dog may start to lose weight.


In some circumstances, this can be masked by fluid accumulation in the belly due to poor circulation. However, these dogs will feel bony when stroked and have a disproportionately big abdomen.

, If you notice any symptoms of heart disease in your German shepherd, take them to the vet. The vet will perform a thorough clinical exam and assess the dog's body condition, how lively the dog is, and how well the dog is breathing. The vet will listen to the way the heart sounds with a stethoscope in order to detect heart murmurs and irregular heart rhythms. This exam may indicate if heart disease is likely and what the nature of the problem is.


Further tests are required and these can include an ECG trace to give information about the heart rate, rhythm, and the size of the chambers.
Your dog may need to wear a Holter 24 hour ECG harness. This trace is recorded over a 24 hour period and may be necessary in order to catch erratic episodes of heart arrhythmia. The dog is fitted with a special Halter harness, which records the ECG continuously.
Radiography gives information about the size, shape, and position of the heart, plus whether the lungs are congested with fluid or not.
An ultrasound exam gives a direct visualization of the heart and the blood flow to it. It allows the operator to measure the thickness of the heart muscles, study the health of the valve leaflets, and watch the dynamic flow of blood in order to find extraneous blood vessels or blood flowing in the wrong direction.

Watch for warning signs before a seizure.,
Stay calm and give your dog space.,
Make the area safe.,
Contact the veterinarian after the seizure.",How to Treat Epilepsy in German Shepherds1," Some dogs show warning signs before they have seizures. Your dog's muscles may twitch and he may have bowel problems. Pay attention for changes in your German Shepherd's behavior. The following can be signs that a seizure is on the way. Your dog seems:Scared
Worried
Clingy
Dazed and confused;
, Unfortunately, there's not much you can or should do while your dog is having a seizure. Try to stay calm while your dog gets through the seizure. Since dogs can be unpredictable and cause injury while having a seizure, you should avoid:Holding your German Shepherd
Handling or touching your dog
Letting your German Shepherd around other dogs

, While you shouldn't try to restrain your dog, you should make his environment safe. As soon as you see him experiencing a seizure, remove anything around him that could be dangerous if he bumped, ran, or fell onto it. For example, you should block off the stairs or close doors so your dog doesn't get outside.You should also keep the area quiet. Your German Shepherd is already being overwhelmed so a quiet, calm space can make him more comfortable.

, As soon as you notice your dog having a seizure, try to take a video of it. When you talk to the vet, you can show the video which will help determine if your German Shepherd did have a seizure or if he's experiencing a different condition or behavior.Keep an eye on your German Shepherd after the seizure. He may still have trouble walking or moving and may have temporary blindness or bleeding.

Protect your German shepherd puppy’s ears from damage.",How to Tape Up Stubborn German Shepherd Puppy Ears," Simply put, not all German shepherd puppy ears are created equal. For example, thin ears that do not have much cartilage may not be stiff enough to stand upright on their own. On the contrary, thicker ears probably have enough cartilage and muscle development to stand up more easily.Ears that are widely spaced on your puppy’s head may have a harder time standing upright.Smaller ears are more likely to stand up naturally than larger ears.;
, Although it is the breed standard for German shepherds to have upright ears,it is not necessary that your own puppy meet the breed standard. It is your personal preference whether your puppy should meet this standard.


Due to their structure, upright ears are less prone to ear infections than floppy ears. Upright ears also do not have be cleaned as frequently as floppy ears (about once a month versus once a week).Floppy ears tend to trap more moisture than upright ears, are therefore more prone to ear infections.Be aware that not all German shepherd puppy ears will stand up. This is known as “soft ear” and could lead to ear problems.Consult with your veterinarian or a German shepherd breeder if you are undecided on whether to tape your puppy’s ears.

, Even with the option of taping, it is preferable for German shepherd puppy ears to stand up without assistance.You cannot wait indefinitely for your puppy’s ears to stand up, though—if they have not stood completely up by the time he is 7 to 8 months old, they are unlikely to stand up at all.Be mindful that it is not possible to have 100% certainty that your puppy's ears will stand up naturally on their own.
Some puppy's ears will be upright on their own in as few as 8 weeks. For other puppies, it might take as long as 6 months before their eyes stand upright.Also, one ear may stand upright before the other.

, Fortunately, you will not need many supplies to tape your German shepherd puppy’s ears. In fact, you may already have some of the supplies at home. One of the supplies you will need is women’s large foam rollers.Rollers are available at your local pharmacy.


The large size of rollers is usually pink, but do not rely on color to choose the correct size.
Alternatively, you could use small pipe insulation tubing, which is available at home improvement stores. If you choose to use tubing, it should be about the same diameter as a large foam roller.You will also need tape. The type of tape to use is very important! The best type of tape to use is white surgical tape (two-inch wide 3M Micropore tape), which is available at your local pharmacy.Masking tape is another option, but is less preferred than surgical tape.
Do not use duct tape or electrical tape. These types of tape are too adhesive and could damage your puppy’s ears.
You will also need glue (Skin Bond adhesive is recommended) and one or two unsharpened # 2 pencils.False eyelash glue is not recommended.A popsicle stick will be needed to serve as a ‘bridge’ between your puppy’s ears after you have taped them., Remove the plastic rod from the middle of the roller. Next, insert the unsharpened pencil about 1 inch into the middle opening of the roller—this will help you stabilize the roller when you position it inside the ear. You will then apply the glue about three-fourths of the way around the circumference of the roller.Apply enough glue to coat the roller, but not so much that the glue oozes or drips from the roller. If you apply too much, the glue could run into your puppy’s ear canal and potentially cause irritation. The glue could also drip onto your hands, which would make it difficult for you to easily maneuver your hands.If you are uncomfortable with the glue, you could cover the roller with tape, sticky side out. If you prefer to use the tape, you will not need to put the pencil in the roller., Proper positioning of the foam roller is important so that you do not block your puppy’s ear canal and impair his ability to hear. Place the roller inside the ear near the bottom half of the ear flap. Make sure there is two fingers’ worth of space between the bottom of the roller and your puppy’s head.It may help to gently press the roller into the inside of the ear so that the glue or tape on the roller touches the ear.

, Holding the pencil end of the roller, wrap the ear around the roller. While continuing to hold the pencil end, start taping at the top of the ear in a circular motion and work your way down. Use firm pressure when taping the ear, but be careful not to tape the ear too tightly—not only would this be uncomfortable for your puppy, but it may also cut off circulation to the ear.Remove the pencil with a gentle upward motion before you finish taping the ear.Even if one ear is already standing upright, it is ideal to tape up both ears., Place the popsicle stick behind the top of both ears and secure it to each ear with additional tape or glue. The popsicle stick will act like a bridge between the ears to keep them upright and stabilized while they are taped., Your puppy will probably want to start messing with his ears as soon as you finish taping them up. Distracting him for about five minutes will give the glue and/or tape time to set. You can distract him with food or a few minutes of playtime.Puppies naturally have a lot of energy, so keeping your puppy still while the glue and/or tape sets will probably not work very well. Distracting him with activities that he enjoys will divert his attention from his ears, at least temporarily.

, Your puppy’s ears may need up to two weeks to remain stabilized in the upright position. During this time, your puppy will probably manage to remove the popsicle stick and might even start unraveling the tape from his ears. This is most likely to happen in the first 24 hours after you have taped his ears.If you notice the tape unraveling, or that the popsicle stick has come off, make the fixes where needed.
Cover up his ears with a plastic bag if it is raining outside when it’s time for your puppy to go out.Consider taking the tape off after seven days to see if the ears will stand up on their own. If not, re-tape the ears., It is recommended to use an adhesive remover to remove the tape from your puppy’s ears.This product can be found at your local home improvement store. Following the instructions on the adhesive remover bottle, gently and slowly remove the tape and foam roller from your puppy’s ears.


Do not forcefully rip off the tape or rip out the roller.Not only will this be painful for your puppy, but you may also end up damaging the inside of your puppy’s ears.
Do not be worried if your puppy’s ears do not stand exactly upright when you remove the tape and foam roller. His ears may be a little weak after being taped, but will strengthen over time., It is recommended to wait until after your German shepherd puppy’s adult teeth have started to come in (around 3 to 5 months) to tape up his ears. You may even want to wait until after he has finished teething (around 7 months) before taping up his ears.Taping his ears too soon may end up damaging his ears to the point where they will not stand up on their own.Because calcium is being diverted from your puppy’s ears to his teeth during teething, his ears will probably switch back and forth between standing up and flopping down.Talk with your veterinarian if you are unsure of when to start considering taping up his ears.

, During the teething process, your puppy’s ears will probably lose calcium. Without enough calcium, your puppy’s ears may have a harder time standing upright. Giving him a little extra calcium in his diet (1 tablespoon of cottage cheese or yogurt per meal) will help to replace this calcium deficiency.Even though it may tempting to do so, do not give your puppy calcium supplements. The extra calcium could deposit in his bones and lead to long-term orthopedic problems, such as bone spurs and arthritis, later in life.Consult with your veterinarian on ways to provide your puppy with extra calcium.

, Your puppy’s overall health plays an important role in the health and strength of his ears. One thing you should do is keep your puppy up to date on his vaccinations and deworming schedule. You should also feed him a well-balanced, high-quality puppy food., If you notice that his ears stand up one day and then flop down the next, encourage your puppy to use his ears more and more. The more he perks his ears up, the stronger his ear muscles will become and the more likely his ears will stand upright. Try making interesting noises and sounds (e.g., honking a car horn, clapping your hands, ringing a bell) to get your puppy to perk his ears up.Giving him chew toys and bones to chew on will also be helpful. The chewing motion strengthens the muscles at the base of the ear., Damage to your puppy’s ears can prevent them from being able to stand upright. Contrary to popular belief, massaging the base of your puppy’s ears will not encourage them to stand upright. In fact, massaging, rubbing, and playing with your puppy’s ears can actually damage them.If your puppy sleeps in a crate, try to keep him from sleeping with his head against the side of the crate. This sleeping position can damage his ears.Puppies can pull and tug on each other’s ears.If you have other puppies, keep an eye on them to make sure they leave each other’s ears alone as much as possible.
Clean your puppy’s ears regularly. Ear cleaners are available at your local pet store. Talk with your veterinarian for advice on how to clean your puppy’s ears.

Diagnose PDA.,
Undergo surgery for PDA.,
Diagnose sudden cardiac death.,
Treat sudden cardiac death.",How to Treat Heart Disease in German Shepherds2," A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a hereditary problem where a blood vessel that joins the aorta and the pulmonary artery in the fetus fails to close when the puppy is born. This is diagnosed when the vet hears a typical waxing-and-waning murmur.This defect is present at birth and usually picked up when the puppy is presented for vaccination.

, The treatment for PDA in German shepherd puppies is surgical occlusion of the abnormal blood vessels so blood can no longer avoid the heart by passing through the duct. This is done by either ligating the duct or by passing a special coil inside the blood vessel in order to block it.Putting a coil into the blood vessel is specialist surgery, but experts are able to feed the coil into the correct position by inserting it into the femoral artery, back up to the aorta, and then into the duct.
Puppies that have a corrective procedure do very well. Left untreated, the German shepherd puppies usually progress into heart failure and may only survive a few months to a year before going into heart failure.

, Sudden cardiac death is another inherited condition which can lead to German shepherd dying suddenly at the young age of four to eight months. Death usually occurs during sleep or when the dog is resting after exercise.The reason for death is an irregular heartbeat, which causes the heart to go into spasm where it is unable to pump blood.In the congenital form which German shepherds suffer from, there is nothing wrong with the physical structure of the heart. The problem lies in the electrical current that causes the heart to beat. Thus it can be difficult to detect the dog has a problem until it is too late.Potentially fatal irregular heart beats may only occur in episodes which happen sporadically. The rest of the time the dog appears normal and there is no detectable heart murmur.
Diagnosis is usually made by the dog wearing a Halter harness for a 24-hour ECG trace.

, There are limited options for treating sudden cardiac death. Half of the affected dogs die suddenly before 12 months of age. In dogs where the problem is identified, the use of intravenous doses of antiarrhythmic drugs, such as lidocaine or procainamide, can help get the heart back into a regular rhythm.However, giving the dog drugs is not practical in the majority of situations given the erratic and unpredictable timing of the episodes and there being a need to get medication into the dog immediately.
The responsible breeder would not breed from German shepherds that are known to have produced sudden death puppies.

Learn the difference between the two types of heart muscle disease.,
Diagnose the heart muscle condition.,
Treat the condition with diuretics.,
Give your German shepherd medication for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.,
Get medication for dilated cardiomyopathy.,
Monitor your dog regularly.",How to Treat Heart Disease in German Shepherds3," German shepherds are affected by two types of cardiomyopathy: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy. These two conditions affect the heart muscle but in different ways.


Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy refers to a thickening of the heart muscle. The thickened walls of the heart cause a decrease in the size of the heart chambers whose job it is to fill with blood. Thus each heartbeat pushes a smaller volume of blood around the body, leading to the clinical signs.Dilated cardiomyopathy is the opposite problem, where the heart wall muscle thins and becomes soft and baggy like a balloon that has been blown up and let down several times. The lack of tone in the muscle means the heart makes weak pumping movements and is inefficient of sending blood round the body., The two conditions are difficult to distinguish on clinical signs alone. Therefore, a diagnosis is usually made via imaging, such as an ultrasound which is used to measure the thickness of the heart wall., There are several medical treatments available which improve the ability of the heart to pump and therefore improve the dog's quality of life. One is diuretics. These are drugs that shift retained water, such as fluid that accumulates in the lungs because of inadequate blood circulation. This makes it easier for the dog to breath and helps improve circulation.Typically furosemide and or spironolactone are prescribed. An initial loading dose may be given, and then a reduced daily dose by mouth is given to keep the patient stable. This is appropriate for both hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy.
Furosemide is given two or three times daily, while spironolactone is given once daily by mouth.

, There are different medicine treatments available for hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy. One treatment option for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is beta blockers. The most widely used beta blocker for this condition is propranolol. This slightly slows the heart rate, which is helpful in cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The medicine helps give the chambers longer to fill with blood, which improves the volume pumped out with each stroke.The beta blockers are given orally twice a day.


Calcium channel blocking agents, such as diltiazem, are another medicine used to help treat hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. These help the heart muscle relax more fully between heartbeats, therefore filling with blood more effectively. The regular formulation is given three times daily, or a slow release once-daily formulation is available.

, There are a couple different medications your German shepherd can take if they have dilated cardiomyopathy. Pimobendan is an important treatment for dilated cardiomyopathy which can extend life if routine screening is undertaken and a problem identified before clinical signs develop. Pimobendan can delay the onset of clinical disease and increase life expectancy. It acts by improving heart muscle contraction and acting on blood vessels to minimize the resistance to blood flow. This means it requires less work to push blood around the body.


Pimobendan must be given on an empty stomach. This is given twice a day by mouth, every 12 hours.ACE inhibitors is another treatment for DCM. It works by opening up small blood vessels in the extremities, so there is less resistance to blood flow. This is a tablet given once or twice daily.

, After diagnosis, your German shepherd requires regular monitoring to ensure they remain on the correct dose of medication. It is common to adjust the dose of medication in order to compensate for deterioration or to decrease the dose as the dog improves.


It is standard practice to see a stable patient every three months, but ultimately this is at the discretion of your vet and your German shepherd's condition.

Distinguish between seizures and epilepsy.,
Find the cause of epilepsy.,
Get your German Shepherd examined.,
Get a diagnosis of epilepsy.",How to Treat Epilepsy in German Shepherds2," During a seizure, your dog may twitch or shake uncontrollably. Seizures can be a one-time event. If so, they're usually caused by a specific illness or injury. But, if seizures happen repeatedly, they're referred to as epilepsy.Since it's important to determine if your dog has repeated seizures in order to make an epilepsy diagnosis, track if and when your dog has repeated seizures and how long they last.

, Many things can cause seizures or epilepsy in a German Shepherd. The veterinarian will need to test for other conditions or to see whether your dog is in good health. Some common causes of epilepsy in the German Shepherd include:Eating toxic substances
Diabetes
Low blood sugar
Liver disease
Kidney disease
Brain infections (like encephalitis), injuries, or cancer
Strokes
Problems with the blood such as electrolyte imbalance or anemia

, The vet will take a complete medical history of your dog and examine him for head injury. The vet will also want to know what your dog has recently eaten. Although there aren't diagnostic tests for epilepsy, the vet will do blood work, urine testing, and possibly an electrocardiogram (ECG).These are done to rule out other conditions. If other conditions are found, your dog is diagnosed with secondary epilepsy.

, If the vet can find no cause for the repeated seizures, your German Shepherd will be diagnosed with primary or idiopathic epilepsy. This true form of epilepsy means that your dog's brain is experiencing uncontrolled bursts of energy that aren't caused by any illness or injury.Primary epilepsy usually shows up in dogs between the ages of 6 months to 6 years of age. German Shepherds can inherit the condition.

Feed three times day, then wean to twice.,
Brush your dog, don't bathe it.,
Take care of your puppy's feet.,
Get your puppy's eyes checked.",How to Train and Care for Your New Siberian Husky Puppy1," An adult husky should eat two meals a day. Puppies, however, will need to eat more often to start. Feed your husky three meals a day until three months of age, then two meals a day after that. If the puppy is struggling to finish his meals or his tummy is very full and distended on three meals before the age of three months, then divide the daily allowance between four meals instead.
At 12 to 16 weeks, you will notice the puppy just picks a little at the afternoon meal. At this point, you can discontinue it.Feed a high-quality food that is not full of artificial additives.This is important at any age, but especially so for a growing puppy.
Feeding on a regular schedule will help with housebreaking the dog, as most husky puppies will need to go outside 15 to 30 minutes after eating.Do not allow your husky to ""free feed"" at any age. Providing meals at set times, and taking the dish away when the dog is done eating, is one way to show your stubborn husky that you are in charge.;
, Huskies are naturally clean dogs. They will groom themselves, and have little odor. As a result, you can bathe a husky as seldom as once a year. But, the dog's thick coat will require frequent brushing.Most of the year, you should brush your dog once a week, taking this opportunity to clean and inspect its ears and brush his its teeth.During shedding season, daily brushing will help decrease shedding in your home., Because huskies are working dogs, their feet are very important to them. You should trim long hairs on their feet and keep their nails trimmed.Dogs have blood vessels in their nails, so it's important not to trim too short. If you aren't experienced trimming a dog's nails, it may be best to ask a groomer or vet to do it, or at least show you how., Because the Siberian husky's tendency toward eye problems, it is important to get your puppy's eyes checked at a young age. Specifically, huskies are often diagnosed with:Cataracts, a film over the lens of the eye.
Corneal dystrophy, a cloudiness over the cornea that females are especially prone to.
Progressive retinal atrophy, a condition in which the dog's eyes slowly degenerate until it becomes blind.
These conditions are often hereditary. Find out all you can about your puppy's parents to find out if they are likely to occur.

Be prepared to give your dog adequate exercise.,
Build up the amount of exercise you give your dog slowly.,
Only exercise your husky during cool weather.,
Watch closely for signs of overheating.",How to Take Care of a Siberian Husky1," These high energy dogs need a lot of exercise; it’s what keeps a husky happy. Healthy huskies need the equivalent of three to five miles of exercise four days a week.


This exercise can be in the form of running, playing with other dogs, swimming, or one-dog sledding type sports, such as bikejoring, skijoring, or swimjoring.;
, Your husky may have the energy to run all out the first day, but it doesn't have the conditioning. When biking, go slow enough that your husky can run at an easy pace.


Most dogs start out much too fast and need to be managed until they settle into a comfortable pace. It's easy to out run a husky on a bike, which puts your husky at risk for overheating, becoming overwhelmed because the pace is too fast, and fearing the exercise.

, Temperatures above 65ºF (18ºC) are bordering on too hot to exercise. If there is a breeze, low humidity, or your dog can easily cool off in water, you may be able to exercise at these temperatures.


On hot summer days keep exercise to a minimum or only exercise before the sun comes up and heats up the day.
Consider altering outdoor exercise with indoor exercise in an air-conditioned building.
Keep in mind that racing sled dogs do not work very hard unless the temperature is below 20ºF (-6ºC).
Keep warm weather exercise sessions less than 3 miles (4.8 km) long (less than 5K).

, Siberian huskies have multiple coats of fur, and were bred for working in the snow. Keep this in mind when you take them out on a warm day. These include: excessive panting, excessive salivation, bright red tongue and gums (or pale gums), thick saliva, weakness, collapse, and vomiting, which is sometimes bloody. You never want to get your dog to this point, as heat illness (stroke, overheating) can cause serious consequences to your husky.


Give your husky plenty of cool water to drink. Some dogs enjoy ice as well.
There are ways to prevent heatstroke starting with using common sense. If you are uncomfortable in hot weather your husky, with its thick fur coat, is probably much more uncomfortable to the dog, than you.
If you exercise your husky using a head halter, make sure your husky can open its mouth wide enough to pant normally. The mouth is the only pathway for reducing body heat.
The larger the dog, the harder it is to stay cool. Dogs stay cool through panting. Larger dogs have more body heat to get rid of, so it takes time for them to cool. If you have a large husky – 60+ pounds(27kg+) – take extra precautions in the heat.

Be patient.",How to Treat Obesity in Labrador Retrievers," Eating too much is the main reason why dogs gain weight.Reducing your Lab’s caloric intake will help treat its obesity. Before changing anything about your Lab’s diet, though, talk with your vet. Knowing your Lab’s current diet (quantity eaten, treats, human food, supplements) will give your vet a starting point for making necessary dietary changes., It may be tempting to simply reduce the quantity of what you already feed your Lab. However, doing this will reduce your Lab’s nutrient intake, possibly leading to nutrient deficiencies.Instead, feed your Lab a specially-formulated weight loss food. Below is some additional information about weight loss foods:The labels on over-the-counter (OTC) weight loss foods (“less active,” “weight control”) are not associated with specific nutritional standards and can be misleading. Therefore, you should purchase a prescription weight loss food through your vet.
Prescription weight loss foods tend to contain more protein, vitamins, and minerals than OTC foods, decreasing the risk of nutrient deficiencies.
Some weight loss foods are not very calorie-dense, meaning you can continue feeding about the same volume of food to your Lab without increasing its caloric intake.

, No matter how much you feed a Lab, it will always want more.If you have other pets, feed your Lab by itself so it’s not tempted to eat another pet’s food.If you have children, do not feed them when your Lab is around. It may beg for your children’s food, and succeed in getting it. Also, supervise your children if they feed your Lab; they may feed it too much and not realize it.Measure your Lab’s food with a measuring cup to ensure you're feeding your Lab the right amount of food.

, Although your Lab now needs to eat fewer calories, you do not have to cut treats completely out of its diet. Instead, you can feed the occasional healthy treat, such as apple slices, unbuttered popcorn, and bits of bananas.Ask your vet about healthy and appropriate treats before feeding them to your Lab.Be aware that table scraps should not be a treat.They are usually high in sugar and fat.

, It won’t be enough to simply feed the new weight loss food. Keep a consistent meal time and feed the same amount at each meal time.The more consistent you are with feeding the new food, the more likely your obese Lab will lose weight.

, Your Lab probably won’t be as excited as you are about the dietary changes. Below are some common problems and solutions regarding these changes:Begging or looking hungry more often: put the food in a food puzzle toy or distract your Lab with a fun activity (playing, petting)
Raiding the trash for more food: give your Lab more toys to play with
Refusing the new food: switch to the new food over at least one week (gradually increase the mix of new vs old food); use healthy treats to make the new food look more enticing

, Sometimes, a dietary change can affect a dog’s appearance and activity level.For example, the diet can change the quality of a dog’s coat. If your Lab’s coat starts looking less healthy (not as shiny), or if your Lab seems more tired, tell your vet about these changes. Your vet may recommend trying a new weight loss food.

, Exercise is the other component to treating your Lab’s obesity. It will help your Lab burn extra calories. Before ramping up your Lab’s exercise routine, talk with your vet about how much exercise your Lab can handle. To help you come up with an exercise plan, your vet will consider factors like physical limitations (arthritis, injury), other illnesses, and your ability to exercise with your Lab.If exercising with your Lab will be a challenge for you, consider hiring a dog walker or pet sitter that can spend time with your Lab.

, You may be excited about increasing your Lab's exercise, but it’s important to start gradually. Obesity can make exercise very difficult for dogs, since the extra weight makes moving around a challenge.Instead, start with short, low- to moderate-intensity exercises, like a leisurely walk.To begin the exercise regimen, take your Lab for 5-minute walks a few times a day. When your Lab can handle these walks, gradually increase the time so you can spend 30 to 45 minutes walking with your Lab each day.High-impact exercises, like playing fetch or going for a run, are great for dogs. However, it will probably be better for you to focus on less intense exercises until your Lab reaches its ideal weight.

, Overweight dogs usually breathe heavily during exercise, since they’re not in very good shape.When you walk with your Lab (or do other exercises), pay attention to how it’s breathing. If it starts breathing heavily, cut the exercise session short. Allow your Lab to rest and regain its breath.

, When your vet first determined that your Lab was obese, they likely recommended an ideal weight for it. To assess your Lab’s weight loss progress, weigh your Lab every two to three weeks.If weighing your Lab at home is not convenient, take it to your vet’s office for regular weigh ins.


A healthy weight loss rate for dogs is one to two percent of body weight per week. If your Lab is not losing weight at that rate, or not losing weight at all, talk with your vet about adjusting your Lab’s diet or exercise regimen., When your Lab is no longer obese, pat yourself on the back! Don’t celebrate for too long, though—it will still take work to make sure your Lab doesn’t put the weight back on. With your Lab at its ideal weight, maintaining the weight loss will be important.


Some dogs can continue eating as they did while on the weight loss program. Other dogs, though, may have to eat less after reaching their ideal weight. This is because their metabolism (rate of burning calories) may have slowed down while losing weight.Continue to exercise with your Lab.

, Successfully treating your Lab’s obesity will not happen overnight.It may be a number of months before your Lab achieves its ideal weight. Do not lose patience with the process or your Lab, though. The effort to treat your Lab’s obesity will pay off when your Lab becomes healthy and active again.

Follow the veterinarian's treatment plan.,
Give your dog phenobarbital.,
Treat with potassium bromide.,
Use gabapentin.,
Put your dog on Pexion.,
Try diazepam.,
Consider supplemental treatments.",How to Treat Epilepsy in German Shepherds3," Seizures caused by epilepsy are primarily treated by medication to reduce the number and severity of symptoms. Since these medications can cause side effects (like liver and kidney damage), talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits to your dog. If your dog is having frequent seizures (more than a few times a month) or if they last for long periods of time (more than five minutes), it's time to consider medication treatment.Most medications have to be given once or twice a day for your dog's life. Twice daily medication is to be given 12 hours apart since late or missed doses can cause seizures.
Your dog will need frequent vet visits to adjust medication levels.

, Phenobarbital is the most common medication used in German Shepherds with epilepsy. It works by suppressing seizure activity in the brain. Your dog will have short-term symptoms like increased hunger or thirst. Monitor your dog's diet so he doesn't gain weight. Other symptoms include:Mild sedation
Incoordination
Liver damage (long-term side effect)

, If your dog doesn't respond to phenobarbital, the vet will also prescribe potassium or sodium bromide. Potassium bromide can work with phenobarbital to decrease seizure activity in the brain. You can mix the medication into your dog's food or treats. Avoid feeding salty foods since it can make the medication less effective. Other side effects include:Sedation
Incoordination
Increased hunger and thirst
Hind-end weakness (contact the vet immediately if you see this)

, This anti-epileptic drug is usually prescribed along with other medication to control generalized seizures. It's also used to relieve pain, but may cause serious side effects like kidney damage. If you notice any of the following signs, contact the veterinarian:Diarrhea
Vomiting
Loss of balance
Sleeping an unusually long amount of time
Bulging eyes

, Since many traditional epilepsy medications cause liver or kidney damage over time, new epilepsy medications are being developed to minimize symptoms. One newer medication, Pexion, controls electrical activity in the brain, but has less chance of causing liver damage.Like phenobarbital and potassium bromide, Pexion can cause increased eating, drinking and drowsiness.

, Diazepam is used to control seizures, especially if your dog has multiple seizures without a rest in between them. If your doctor recommends diazepam, it may be given in the vein (IV) at the vet's office or you'll be instructed to give it rectally at home. Diazepam is an anti-epileptic drug that may also make your dog feel drowsy. Eventually, your dog will adjust to the sedative effect.If your German Shepherd reacts too strongly to one medication, you may need to put him on combination drug therapy (like diazepam and phenobarbital).

, Your dog will need to be on medication to control his seizures. But, there are some safe treatments you can use in addition to the medications recommended by the vet. Only try supplemental treatments if your veterinarian recommends them. Supplemental treatments include:Acupuncture
Diet such as a hypoallergenic diet to prevent food allergies from contributing to seizures.
Essential fatty acids
Nutraceuticals—various vitamin and nutritional supplements
Homeopathy
Various herbs or flower essences

Use a shedding brush once a week on your dog’s coat.",How to Groom a Siberian Husky," An undercoat rake is a rake with long teeth set widely apart. It is designed to move past the outer guard hairs on your Husky’s coat and get down to the loose undercoat hairs. Look for undercoat rakes at your local pet supply store., This is a brush with a slanted head containing fine metal pins set in a rubber cushion. You can purchase a slicker brush from your local pet supply store.The slicker brush will pull dead hairs from your Husky’s outer coat and detangle any mats in her undercoat. It also stimulates your dog’s skin and removes dander or dead cells from her skin.
The cushion will protect your dog’s skin from pressure during brushing.

, A Furminator is a special grooming brush. Though not required, a Furminator brush will make grooming you Husky less time consuming.


Only use a Furminator that is meant for longer dog coats, as a short coat Furminator will damage the longer coat of your Husky., This is a must for any Husky dog owner. Look for a high quality vacuum like a Dyson, with an animal attachment. Though a good vacuum can be expensive, they should last you for a very long time and will help you rid your home of dog hair.A vacuum will also be essential for cleaning up after a grooming session.

, In addition to the specialty grooming supplies mentioned above, you will also need basic supplies like:


Organic dog shampoo.
Lots of towels.
A portable hair dryer or a large blower.
A small pair of scissors.
Nail clippers.
Dog treats to reward your Husky after the grooming session.

, Huskies do not have a very oily coat so they do not have that usual doggy odor. Bathing your Husky too often will cause her fur and skin to dry out and turn dull.Most Huskies will take a “snow bathe” in the winter. They flip over onto their backs and wiggle and roll around in the snow. So Mother Nature helps them stay clean!

, Only do a few light passes over her coat with this brush. Avoid over grooming with a Furminator brush as it can damage the guard hairs in her coat.It is difficult to brush a Husky’s undercoat when its wet. As well, a wet matted undercoat does not dry well and can cause your Husky to get skin rashes or hot spots. So its important to give your pup a light brush before you start the bath., Lay a screen over your drain to catch the loose hairs from your dog’s coat. Otherwise you will end up with a clogged drain. Have lots of towels nearby to wipe up any puddles or splashes.Some owners prefer to take their Husky to a grooming shop to be bathed and blow dried. But it can be expensive to pay for a groomer to wash a large double coated dog like a Husky.
You can also opt for a happy medium and take your Husky to a You Wash It shop. The shop supplies big washing sinks and blowers, and you supply the Husky, the shampoo, and the towels. It’s less expensive than the groomers and you have access to special equipment to get the job done.

, Wet her head as well. Be sure to tilt back her head so water does not get in her eyes.Avoid getting water in her ears.

, Huskies do not require special conditioning shampoos, as their hair is not long enough to get any major tangles. Look for an organic shampoo that will be gentle and soft on your dog’s coat.You can also apply an oatmeal conditioner to your Husky’s coat if it looks a little dull or ratty. The oatmeal will also soothe any itchy spots or hot spots on your dog’s coat.Be sure to also clean the inner surface of your dog’s ears, using a cotton ball soaked in mineral oil, to prevent ear mites., Make sure you get as much of the soap out of her coat as possible. You may need to rinse her coat several times., Give your wet Husky a light towel off. Set the blow dryer on cool air and blow dry her coat. Be prepared for lots of flying hair from your Husky’s clean coat. If possible, have a vacuum nearby., Once your dog’s coat is completely dry, brush it to remove any dead fur released during the bath.You can also use a slicker brush to brush out your dog’s coat.

, Place a sturdy table that is at least 48 inches long in an open space, like a garage or a driveway. Like more dogs, Huskies tend to fidget when they are groomed, so the extra length of the table keeps them from sliding off.You can also put the Husky on a counter top or workshop table in your garage if you don't have access to a 48 inch long table.
Attach a neck loop to a pole on one side of the table. You can tie a stripe of cloth or soft fabric to the pole to make the neck loop. If you can find a neck loop with an adjustable arm (available at most pet stores), this is a better option as you can adjust the neck loop so your Husky can relax her head as you groom her. Never adjust the neck loop so high that your husky is forced to hold his head up.
Attach another pole to the opposite end of the table. Then, attach a longer neck loop or a white rope to the pole. This will serve as a hip loop to keep your Husky still as you groom them. If you have someone else who can assist you as you groom and hold your Husky still at the hips, you may not need a hip loop attachment.

, Loop the neck hold over her head so it sits comfortably around her neck. Then, loop the hip loop over her hips to keep her in place.

, Then, trim the hairs growing between the pads on the undersides of her feet so her feet appear neat and clean., Knowing where to trim your dog’s nails takes some practice and skill. If your dog has clear nails, look for the live quick, which will be pink. Cut the nail no closer than 2 millimeters from the quick or the flesh under your dog's nail.If your dog has dark nails, avoid cutting to the quick by trimming one little sliver of nail at a time, starting with the tip. As you cut slices off your dog’s nail, look at the edge of the cut nail. Once you start to see a gray or pink oval, stop trimming.
Most dogs dislike getting their toenails trimmed. It helps to prepare your pup by making sure she is comfortable with you touching her paws. A few tasty dog treats will also help keep her calm and still.

, This will keep her eyes clean and free of dirty.If your dog has constant eye discharge, bring this to the attention of your vet. If your Husky’s eyelashes are interfering with her eyes, your vet can trim them for you.

, They act as sensory devices for your dog, as they vibrate to warn your dog when she comes into contact with a solid object or surface.v

, Use a fine tooth metal flea comb to gently part the hairs in her coat. Look for small black or brown dots.Dip the comb in a glass of hot water periodically to drown any fleas that end up on the comb.
If you discover a large amount of fleas in your dog’s coat, you may need to look at How to Get Rid of Fleas.

, Give your Husky a few reassuring pets and then use the hair dryer or the blower on her coat. Use the cool air setting on the blow dryer. Start from her front paw and work your way up and across the coat. Point the blower nozzle or the blow dryer head straight into her coat, so you can see skin in the center.
If the hair looks like a smooth flat circle all the way around, with no fuzziness to the hair, you don’t need to blow dry your dog’s coat anymore as there is no extra hair in her undercoat to remove.
If there are any fuzzy or clumpy areas on your dog’s coat, you will need to blow them out.
Hold the undercoat rake in one hand and the blower in the other hand. Point the blower or hair dryer at the skin and bring the rake to the bottom half of the circle it creates. The visible bit of skin will be the center of the circle. Groom downward, with a light grip. Brush lightly, and don’t pull or tug at the hair.
Avoid grooming in one spot for too long. Move around your dog’s body and work on different spots.
With this method, you should be able to groom a full coat in less than an hour. The blower helps you to get directly to the undercoat and brush it well.
Once you have finished blowing your dog’s hair, you should be able to back comb or back brush her hair smoothly and easily. You should also be able to run your fingers through your dog’s coat and not feel any unevenness or lumps.

, By nature, Siberians are very clean dogs and will clean themselves on a daily basis. They also shed their entire undercoat least once a year, called “blowing the coat.” This process can last up to six weeks from start to finish. Your job, as an owner, is to clean up after your Husky’s shedding and brush out her coat to encourage shedding and strong hair re-growth.Though your Husky may appear hot during the summer in her thick coat, never shave or over groom them. Her coat is designed to keep her cool in the summer. Her undercoat insulates her and her top coat provides protection from harmful UV rays, so it should never be cut short.

, These consist of a hoop made of metal attached to a plastic handle. It’s a must have tool to upkeep your Husky’s coat and make sure it looks its best.With swift, light side to side motions, run the shedding brush over your Husky’s coat.
It helps to have a second person close by with a vacuum as you groom your Husky with the shedding brush. This will prevent hair from flying all over the place and keep hair off your furniture and your carpet.

Take your dog to a veterinarian.,
Approve life-saving procedures.,
Discuss surgical options.,
Give attentive after care.,
Reduce risk factors in the future.",How to Treat Gastric Torsion and Bloat in Labrador Retrievers1," There is no home remedy or medication that you can give to a dog suffering to bloat. The treatment is surgical, to decompress and reposition the stomach. For this procedure, time is of the essence. Because of this, if you suspect bloat, take your dog to the vet immediately.


Your first action should be to phone the vet to warn them you are in the way in, and then take your dog directly to the clinic.
If your normal veterinarian's office is closed, for instance the incident happens in the evening, take your dog to an emergency veterinarian.;
, The first thing your vet will likely do is put the dog on a drip and give the dog high-rate intravenous fluids in order to control the shock and protect organs from shutting down. After this initial stabilization, the vet may try and pass a stomach tube.If the vet is able to pass a stomach tube then it provides an escape route for the gas, and to stomach pump out the gut contents.


If the dog is co-operative, they may try to put the tube in using a gag (to stop the dog biting the stomach tube), although in many cases sedation is needed.
Sometimes if the twist is not a full 360 degrees, passing a stomach tube and then rolling the dog over can correct the twist.
If it's not possible to pass a stomach tube the vet passes a large bore needle or a special catheter through the body wall into the stomach as an emergency measure to relieve the gas pressure.This buys some time and helps stabilize the dog.

, It is essential that the dog has the stomach repositioned, and this can only be done by a laparotomy. The dog is given a general anesthetic and the vet opens into the belly. The direction of twist is identified and the stomach counter-rotated. Once in a normal position, the vet checks to see if any part of the stomach wall needs resecting as the tissue is dead. In addition, the spleen gets dragged out of position with the stomach and may need removing.The vet will flush out the repositioned stomach either via a stomach tube, or by incising direct into the stomach.


Since there is a risk of re-twisting, the vet may opt to give an anesthetic and perform a preventative procedure called a gastropexy. This involves suturing the stomach to the body wall in such a way that it can't physically flip over again., The period immediately after surgery is a dangerous time, as toxins flood into the bloodstream once the stomach is back in position. This can lead to irregular heart beats and a possible heart attack. The vet will monitor the patient and keep them on an intravenous drip to try and correct any rhythm disturbances with intravenous drugs.After the in-hospital recovery period, you will need to care for your dog as it recovers fully at home. Give it lots of love and attention but treat it gently and let it rest. Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for after surgery care as well.

, Certain factors have been identified as increasing the risk of bloat. While it is not possible to completely protect against GDV/bloat, you can lower the chances of it occurring by taking the following steps:Feed your dog from a bowl on the floor. There is an increased risk of bloat with dogs feed from a height.
Use a slow feeder bowl. Bloat is associated with gasping down air, in the manner greedy eaters do.
Feed your dog 2 or 3 meals a day, as one large meal is associated with increased risk.
Do not exercise for 90 minutes after eating. The weight of food in the stomach makes it more like to flip over.
Feed your dog a diet that is low in fermentable ingredients, such as grain or soy.
Do not allow the dog to gulp down lots of water after eating. Like eating food too fast, this can introduce too much air to the stomach.

Prepare your home and yard to prevent escapes.,
Give your puppy lots of exercise.,
Introduce your puppy to other people and animals.",How to Train and Care for Your New Siberian Husky Puppy2," Huskies are the escape artists of the dog world. You'll need to prepare your home for this, doing anything you can to make it hard for them to run away.A husky requires more or less constant vigilance. It will also require a fence that is at least 6 feet high and difficult to dig under. Concrete or strong mesh at the base of the fence works well., Because of their active nature, Siberian husky puppies need a LOT of exercise.


Huskies were bred as working dogs, so they are easily bored if they do not have a task. To keep your husky happy, you will need to make sure it gets 30 to 60 minutes of vigorous exercise every day.Huskies are great dogs to jog with once they get a little older. They love to run, play, and to chase things.
Huskies are energetic and become bored easily. If you don't provide adequate exercise, the consequence will be an unhappy dog that howls constantly and tears apart your home., Huskies are naturally friendly. But like any dog, a husky puppy will need socialization to develop a comfort with people and other animals. Make sure to take your puppy out into the world a young age and introduce it to lots of people and other dogs.


If your puppy seems nervous or suspicious of other dogs or people, a puppy socialization and training class can be a good idea. These classes help your dog learn the right way to interact with others.Socializing your dog at a young age will have a major impact on its personality later in life. Undesirable behaviors like biting, barking, and ""resource guarding"" are often a result of poor socialization."
"
Brush your dog regularly.,
Keep bathing to a minimum.,
Never shave your husky.,
Protect the dog's paws.",How to Take Care of a Siberian Husky2," This will help keep its coat in good condition but it will also reduce the amount of fur it sheds in your home. Consider using a Furminator comb, which is an incredibly effective tool for getting the loose fur from the top coat and undercoat., You can bathe your husky, but sometimes a good brushing and a waterless shampoo is all your dog really needs. When you bathe your dog with shampoo you break down the protective skin oil. Only bathe when absolutely necessary (like after an interaction with a skunk) and make sure his or her fur dries thoroughly to prevent skin problems., Fur helps regulate body temperature. Most huskies have a double coat, which consists of a thick undercoat and a guard hair layer. These layers keep your husky warm and cool.


Only under medical circumstances should you ever shave a husky.
The skin of Nordic dogs is like that of light skinned humans, meaning that it does not protect them from the sun's harmful rays( no pigmentation). When you shave your husky you leave the skin unprotected from the sun.
Also, every time you shave your husky, the undercoat will grow back less successfully and the outer layer of fur will grow back less soft and more apt to get tangles and knots.

, Always check the pads after exercise to make sure they are not damaged by the road or trail surface. Hot surfaces can burn the paw pads severely and rough surfaces can cut the pads. Look carefully at each pad and between each toe. Also double check the nails to make sure they are not so long that they inhibit natural foot movement.Also, dog paws have a few sweat glands. The warm foot, which becomes moist from the sweat gland, against cold snow can lead to the snow getting stuck between your husky's paws. This can cause skin damage. Dog booties can be used to stop this from occurring but if you don't have them, just make sure the dog's paws are clear of snow right after exercise.

Look for the signs of GDV/bloat.,
Take your dog to the vet if in doubt.,
Understand how seriously and quickly bloat affects a dog.",How to Treat Gastric Torsion and Bloat in Labrador Retrievers2," Bloat occurs after eating, as the weight of food in the stomach makes it more pendulous. The risk is greatly increased if the dog is exercised soon after eating. The signs to look for include:Restlessness, pacing, and difficulty settling as if in discomfort.
Drooling saliva.
Trying to be sick but not bringing anything up.
Rapid breathing and a racing heart, even at rest.
Progressive swelling of the belly (this isn't always obvious until the later stages).
Pale gums.
Collapse.

, Untreated bloat is ultimately fatal, often in less than 24 hours. Also, the longer treatment is delayed, the greater risk of complications even if treated. Thus, it is crucial to seek emergency veterinary attention if you suspect that GDV is even a possibility.


It is better to have a false alarm than to wait and see what happens and have the dog deteriorate.

, Bloat is such a serious condition for a number of reasons. Initially, not only is the stomach twisted with fermenting gut contents trapped inside, but the blood supply to the stomach is also twisted and impaired. This cuts off the blood supply to the stomach and its tissues start to die. The body rapidly goes into a state of shock, which in itself can be life-threatening.As the stomach swells, this compresses the major blood vessels to the abdomen and impedes blood returning to the heart, which worsens the shock. Also, toxins from the gut contents get into the bloodstream, and this plus electrolyte disturbances can trigger irregular heartbeats which can lead to a heart attack. In addition, micro blood clots form, which lodge in the organs and send them into failure.
A combination of shock, blood clots, and a necrotic (dying) stomach and (possibly) spleen, mean that some dogs die after only a few hours of illness.

Set appropriate boundaries.,
Potty train your puppy.,
Crate train your puppy.,
Leash train your puppy.,
Train with a clicker.",How to Train and Care for Your New Siberian Husky Puppy3," Because huskies are so stubborn, it is important to set boundaries right away. They need to learn that you are in charge.


Do not let your puppy sleep in your bed, as this creates confusion about its role in the family. You may make an occasional exception when the dog gets older.Have everyone in the household feed the dog a handful of kibble. This teaches your husky that everyone in the house can control its access to food.Be consistent with all rules you set. If you are not, the dog will learn that it can sometimes get what it wants if it tries hard enough. Make sure everyone else in the house on the same page.Be patient. Your dog can be trained if you are firm and consistent. Huskies often enjoy training tasks because they are work dogs., Like any new puppy, your Siberian husky will have to be housebroken. There are three main components to potty training a dog:


Monitoring your puppy. Keep a close eye on your puppy when it is inside to prevent accidents. This is easiest if you confine the dog to small part of your home.If you catch your dog in the act of urinating or defecating inside, make a loud noise and say ""no!"" Then, promptly take the dog outside.Frequent trips outside. A puppy will need to go to the bathroom more often than an adult dog. To minimize the risk of indoor accidents, take the puppy out as often as you can, and on a regular schedule.Rewarding the desired behavior. When your dog goes to the bathroom outside, praise the dog and give it a reward in the form of a small treat. This will help it understand where it should do its business, and reinforce the behavior.Using a clicker can help your dog learn this faster (see below).

, An important part of potty training your dog is crate training. This is when you teach your puppy to be content spending time in its crate. Dogs will not want to soil their own space.For huskies, this is also a good way to minimize damage to your home when you can't be there.When you can't keep an eye on your puppy, put it in its create with a treat or kibble and a chew toy. After awhile, the dog will begin to enjoy spending time there, and may even retreat there if things get stressful.Crate training is easiest if you start by offering your dog a treat inside its crate without closing the door. After a day or so of doing this repeatedly, you can try closing the door for short periods of time. You can then build up to longer periods in the crate.Puppies under ten weeks old should not be confined to a crate for more than an hour. From weeks 11 to 14, your puppy can spend up to three hours in a crate. At weeks 15 and 16, up to four hours may be acceptable. After 17 weeks, a puppy can spend up to five hours in a crate.Never use going to the crate as punishment if you want to successfully crate train., Leash training is also crucial for huskies. Because of their tendency to run off, you must teach them to be cooperative walking on a leash.


Huskies can easily run off and get lost if not on a leash.Get your dog used to the collar by putting one on it while it is eating. The dog will develop comfort and even a positive association with the collar.Then, start by just walking it around the house a little, giving it treats whenever it walks at your side and doesn't pull on the leash. Once you've got that down, try it outside!, As with other puppies, clicker training is a good way to teach huskies commands and obedience.In clicker training, every time your dog does something desirable on command, you click the clicker and give it a treat. the combination of the sound and a reward helps your dog more quickly learn what you want it to do.Start by teaching your dog to associate the click with a treat. Just click at random intervals, then immediately provide a treat.Once your dog has learned this association, you can start using the clicker-treat combination to reward desired behaviors.

Look for symptoms on your husky's coat.,
Look for symptoms in your dog's eyes.,
Get a veterinary diagnosis.,
Get treatment for ocular uveodermatologic syndrome.,
Discuss the risk of autoimmune disease in your pet with your vet.,
Repeatedly screen dogs that are at higher risk of uveodermatologic syndrome.,
Track symptoms you suspect are caused by uveodermatologic syndrome on the skin.,
Take your dog to its vet immediately if you suspect its eyes are affected.",How to Diagnose Autoimmune Disorders in Siberian Huskies," Uveodermatological syndrome may be suspected if patches of your husky's skin lose their pigment. This can occur on the head, such as on the nose, lips, hard palate, or eyelids. It can also show up on the scrotum or anus., Your dog's eyes may be red and itchy and it may have impaired vision. This can cause your dog to rub its eyes or to loose its ability to navigate around the house.The ocular signs can even come on rapidly over 24 hours and consist of sudden blindness.

, A definitive diagnosis can be made by the vet taking a skin biopsy (removing a small pinch of skin) and sending it to a lab for analysis. The lab worker will pick out the absence of pigment cells and the presence of inflammatory cells. The biopsy will also rule out other problems that could mimic uveodermatological damage, such as skin cancer, allergies, or generalized inflammatory conditions.Your vet cannot do a biopsy of the eye to verify the diagnosis. Instead, the vet may start treatment with drugs to reduce inflammation, on the assumption that the condition is uveodermatologic syndrome. In addition, the vet may run tests to rule out conditions such as glaucoma (increased pressure within the eye) and a specialist may draw off a sample of fluid from inside the eye to rule out infection or cancer.

, The ocular form may be treated with corticosteroids either as an eye drop, or injection or tablets. For severe cases additional immunosuppressive drugs may be needed, such as azathioprine.Swift treatment may reverse the inflammation and save the dog's sight. This means that after a careful examination and being reasonably confident there are no contra-indications for starting steroid treatment, the vet may start treatment on the basis of a strong suspicion and the chance to prevent blindness.Treatment is not necessarily warranted for the skin form, as the effects are purely cosmetic.

, Uveodermatologic syndrome is an autoimmune disease. An autoimmune disease is a condition that is not infectious or something the dog catches or acquires. It happens because the body's immune system turns on itself to attack normal tissue.The dog's immune system is designed to detect invading pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, or fungi, and attack and destroy them. The invader is called an ""antigen"" and it is this antigen that activates the immune system. To defend the body ""antibodies"" are produced, designed to deactivate and destroy the invading bacteria or virus.What happens in autoimmune disease is the body reads its own tissues as antigens (foreign materials or threats to health). It then mobilizes its defenses against these tissues in a case of mistaken identity., Some breeds are at increased risk of this syndrome, including the Husky, Akita, and Samoyed.Here the immune system targets two specific areas, which are the melanocytes (pigment producing cells) in the skin and the delicate structures of the eye.

, Certain areas are the body are more likely to be affected and these include the nose, pads, eyelids, scrotum, lips, and hard palate. These areas stop producing pigment and so previously colored areas turn white.This is however only of cosmetic significance and is not painful or injurious to health.


If these symptoms increase consult your veterinarian about the condition.

, This is more serious than the skin form. The immune system attacks the eye leading to severe inflammation both externally (seen as the eye changing color or glowing red) and internally (loss of vision). The eye has limited ways to defend itself and the inflammation can lead to cloudiness across the cornea or front of the eye and also damage to the light-receptive layer at the back of the eye. Both of these impair vision and, if untreated, can lead to permanent blindness."

Examine your husky’s skin.,
Determine if your husky is losing his vision.,
Look at your husky’s eyes.,
Take your husky to the vet.,
Start treatment immediately.,
Administer medications as prescribed.,
Take your husky to your vet regularly.,
Monitor your husky for treatment complications.",How to Treat Autoimmune Disorders in Siberian Huskies," Uveodermatologic syndrome targets the pigmented cells in a husky’s eyes and skin.Loss of pigmentation around the nose, eyes, lips, and anus is usually one of the first signs husky owners notice on their dogs.The footpads and scrotum can also lose pigmentation.In the areas that have lost pigmentation, you may also notice hair loss.;
, Vision loss, which can be sudden, is another common sign of uveodermatologic syndrome.If your husky is bumping into the furniture or walls around your home, he is probably losing his vision. Vision loss could make his walks more challenging.


Uveodermatologic syndrome can cause irreversible blindness due to an increased loss of pigmented cells., Uveodermatologic syndrome can cause many changes in the eye, some of which you will see, and some that occur deeper in the eye. Noticeable eye changes include a cloudy and fluid-filled cornea, enlarged blood vessels in the sclera (the white of the eye), and a swollen iris (colored part of the eye).Your husky may squint his eyes, since they will be more sensitive to light with this syndrome. You may also see tears coming from his eyes.Deeper in the eye, your husky’s retina (multiple layers composed of light-sensitive nerve cells) could detach from the middle part of the eye. This occurs when the syndrome is severe.Your vet would be able to detect the changes occurring deep within your husky’s eyes.

, As soon as you notice signs of uveodermatologic syndrome, take your husky to your vet for a diagnosis. Your vet will do a general physical exam and an eye exam. In addition, they will analyze your husky’s blood and urine, both of which will likely be normal. Your vet will also take some skin samples that will be analyzed by a veterinary specialist.The skin sample will be a skin biopsy, taking in an area of affected skin. Your vet will apply a local anesthetic (numbing agent) to the area before taking the biopsy. If your vet wants to take a skin sample from the eye area, your husky would need be fully sedated or anesthetized., Uveodermatologic syndrome requires immediate treatment to prevent permanent eye damage.Treatment is focused on suppressing the immune system to stop the attack on pigmented cells. Treatment is aggressive at first, then gets tapered over time.Several immunosuppressant drugs are available. Your vet will determine which immunosuppressant drugs will work for your husky, along with their dosages.Steroids, which suppress the immune system, are commonly used to treat uveodermatologic syndrome. They are given as eye drops, injections into the conjunctiva (the inner lining of the eyelid), or by mouth.Treatment for uveodermatologic syndrome is lifelong., Your vet will show you how to give your husky his treatment. Initially, he will need several medications to get the syndrome under control, so be very diligent about administering all of his medications.You may notice your husky responding rapidly to the treatment, but this response may not last very long.If your husky needs eye injections, your vet will likely perform them.
You can give your husky pills or eye drops on your own.

, When your husky begins treatment for uveodermatologic syndrome, he will need to go to the vet twice a week. During these visits, your vet will conduct some laboratory tests, examine your husky’s eyes, and determine if the medications' dosages need to be adjusted.After the initial twice-weekly visits, your vet will recommend a schedule for follow-up visits.


As long as your husky is on treatment, your vet will need to regularly monitor and adjust the medications’ dosages.

, Immunosuppressive therapy can have complications. For example, glucocorticoids, a type of steroid, can cause excess drinking and urination, muscle wasting, and liver disease. Azathioprine, another immunosuppressant, can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and yellowing of the eyes (a sign of liver disease).If your husky is experiencing treatment complications, take him to your vet.


Other effects of steroid therapy include delayed wound healing, skin disease (mange, hard plaques on the skin), and thin skin.With long-term immunosuppressive therapy, a dog can develop infections, particularly bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs).Clinical signs of UTIs include frequent and painful urination and bloody urine; dogs do not always show signs of a UTI.Different immunosuppressant drugs can cause different side effects. Ask your vet about the specific complications of your husky’s prescribed drugs.

Allow your puppy to spend time around different people and experience various sights and sounds.Puppy kindergarten class is a great way to teach your Husky puppy how to interact with other dogs.Enroll your puppy Husky in puppy kindergarten when he is four to five months old.Other than puppy kindergarten, you can socialize your puppy by exposing him to different situations in his environment, such as the sounds of passing cars and honking horns. You can also invite your friends over to help him become comfortable with new people.Taking your puppy to a park is another good way to expose him to different people, sights, and sounds.
Observe your puppy as he explores his new world. If he appears frightened or wary of certain experiences, do not continue to expose him to those situations.;
, By nature, Huskies are very independent and intelligent dogs.However, they can also be stubborn,which can make training difficult. Obedience classes are ideal for training your Husky.Enroll your Husky in a ""junior"" obedience class when she is 4 months old and follow up with adult training around 12 months.For a well-behaved dog, it is imperative you begin training your Husky at a young age.
Be aware that your Husky may use her intelligence to differentiate between training class and home — she may perform the training exercises perfectly in class, then misbehave when she gets home.Frustrating as this may be, continue to practice and reinforce her training at home.

, This is particularly important if you have a Husky puppy. Crate training will help the housetraining process go more smoothly—he will not want to urinate or defecate where he sleeps.In addition, crate training will turn his crate into a safe space to go if your Husky feels scared or needs to rest.Your Husky’s crate is not a place of punishment.Sending him to his crate when he misbehaves may cause your Husky to develop a negative association with his crate.

, If you let your Husky off her leash, she will likely dash away from you to go for a good run or happily pursue something far away.She may love you as her owner, but, if given the chance, her love of running and chasing (and maybe even her predatory instincts) may take over.Because of this, leash training your Husky is essential.


Leash training will also prevent your Husky from pulling on the leash. If she begins to pull, you can either stand still and call her back to you or smoothly and immediately walk in the opposite direction of the pull.Do not jerk or pull back on the leash — this may encourage your Husky to pull even harder.
Do not use a retractable leash — this could cause your Husky to pull even more, since pulling will let her go further.If you have a puppy, let her sniff and ""explore"" her leash and collar in the house before you try walking her outside.Obedience training classes can help you leash train your Husky.

, Huskies are pack animals and expect to have a clear leader of the pack.Your Husky should see you as his leader. A good way to establish this leadership is to make him wait to eat.By controlling when he eats, your Husky will see you as the sole source of his food and resources, and thus his leader.Another way to establish your leadership with your Husky is to lead during your walks with him.By taking the lead, you are confidently showing him that he is to follow you, rather than the other way around.
Do not be surprised if your Husky occasionally tries to become the leader of the pack. If he does, remember to be firm and consistent with your leadership.Do not establish your leadership through bullying or hitting your dog.Your Husky is unlikely to trust and respect you as his leader if you try to establish your leadership through physical intimidation.

, Huskies are working dogs, with their origins in Siberia where they pulled heavy sleds over long distances.Thus, it comes as no surprise that Huskies require daily, vigorous exercise (at least 30 to 60 minutes) to release pent-up energy.Long walks are a great way to exercise your Husky.To encourage your Husky’s ""working dog"" side (and if you are feeling adventurous), tie her leash to a bicycle or wheelbarrow and let her pull you.Do not attempt this if she is not well trained.
Playing fetch and going hiking with your Husky are other good ways to exercise her.If you live by the water, you can take your Husky swimming.Be mindful that Huskies are very energetic dogs, and are almost always ready to play and exercise.Make sure you have the energy to keep up with her!

, Huskies are master escape artists.If you let your Husky exercise in the backyard, prevent his escape by enclosing your yard with a six-foot fence.This may not be enough, however — your Husky’s love of digging may lead him to try to dig his way out of your yard.To prevent a ‘""digging"" escape, have your fence sunk at least several inches into the ground.You could even place concrete or strong mesh wiring at the base of the fence to prevent digging.Contact a fencing company to reconfigure your fence such that your Husky cannot dig his way out.
If your Husky has managed to dig some holes, you can fill them with cinder blocks to discourage further digging.Always supervise your Husky when he is out in the yard. Although your Husky loves the outdoors, leaving him in the backyard unattended will probably make him feel lonely and bored, which could lead to destructive digging., Huskies are very social animals.Your Husky would love to have another dog with whom she can play and exercise. An ideal playmate will be a dog that is about the same size as your Husky and can keep up with her.Allow your Husky to meet other dogs so that she can choose a playmate., Huskies have a double coat, which makes them best suited for cold climates.This does not necessarily mean that you should not own a Husky if you live in a warm climate — you will just need to use more caution when playing and exercising with him during the warmer months of the year.


If you live in a warmer climate, exercise your Husky only in the early morning when it is not too hot outside.Your Husky could overheat if he is outside for too long during the heat of the summer. Try to keep him inside during the hottest part of the day.

, Your Husky is very intelligent, and will need mental stimulation to keep her happily busy and entertained. Kong toys are especially good for Huskies: they are durable and mentally challenge your Husky to figure out how to get the food out.Fill the Kong toy with your Husky's favorite treats.
Be mindful that Huskies can be very destructive. Choose durable chew toys that will keep your Husky busy, but cannot be easily destroyed.
Other than toys, teaching your Husky various tricks (e.g., playing dead, playing fetch) will provide her with plenty of mental stimulation.

, Huskies were originally bred to survive on a small amount of food. Therefore, your Husky will not need to eat a lot of calories to be healthy and have the energy to play and exercise.Feed your Husky either once or twice daily and avoid exercise for at least 90 minutes after eating.Your Husky may need more or less food, depending on such factors as her size, age, and health status.If you have a Husky puppy, begin by feeding her three times a day — early morning, early afternoon, and evening. When she is three to four months old, she will likely cut herself back to twice-daily meals.
Human food and canned food may cause your Husky to become a finicky eater and/or develop diarrhea.If you purchased your Husky from a breeder, he or she can recommend dog foods for your Husky to eat.You can also ask your veterinarian and other Husky owners for food recommendations.

, By nature, Huskies are very clean dogs. They have little to no dog odor and groom themselves frequently, so you will not need to do much extra grooming.However, Huskies do shed quite a bit, particularly during the spring and fall when they blow their coats (complete shedding of the undercoat).The ""blowing coat"" period lasts for at least three weeks.Brush your Husky with a slicker brush at least once a week throughout the year to remove dead hair and keep his coat fresh and shiny.Slicker brushes are available at your local pet store.

Do not shave your Husky's coat in the summer. You may think that shaving his coat will help cool him off, but you are actually removing his protection from harmful ultraviolet rays., Since Huskies do an excellent job of keeping themselves so clean, they rarely need baths. You will probably need to bathe your Husky only once a year.If you are not able to bathe your Husky on your own, you may prefer to take her to a dog groomer.

, Your Husky’s nails should be trimmed once every one to two weeks.If your Husky’s energy and size make it difficult for you to trim his nails on your own, schedule a nail-trimming appointment with your veterinarian. Keep in mind that he may keep his nails naturally trimmed down with his exercise and play., If you can manage it, brush your Husky’s teeth at least two to three times a week.You can purchase veterinarian-approved toothpaste through your veterinarian.Brushing your dog’s teeth will not only keep her breath fresh, but will also prevent plaque and tartar buildup, both of which can lead to serious dental and systemic diseases.Consider talking with your veterinarian for extra guidance on brushing your Husky’s teeth.
If you are not able to brush your dog’s teeth, you can schedule a dental cleaning with your veterinarian. However, this requires general anesthesia and can be very expensive.

Use the proper tools to train a husky.,
Train a solid recall.,
Manage the high prey drive of a husky.",How to Take Care of a Siberian Husky3," The best tools for walking a husky are the front clip harness and the head halter. Harnesses also work, but if you want your dog to learn to pull use the harness for that job. Your husky can learn to pull in a harness and walk nicely with a head halter.


Train with the right equipment. Don't let your husky pull you with while wearing a collar or head harness (even just down the road on your skateboard). The dog can damage its neck and back. Always use a harness.

, Training your dog to come when called is called a recall. Recall training should only be practiced outdoors if your dog is on a leash. To be successful in the recall start practicing it as early as possible. Force-free methods - methods that reinforce with things your dog likes - work best in creating a solid recall.


One of the best way to train a solid recall is to start training your husky at a young age. Make sure it’s on a leash in an enclosed area (fenced in yard) and at a time when it is more relaxed—after a moderate amount of exercise is a great time. Keep some small tasty treats (tiny slivers of cheese or cooked chicken breast) in your pocket. Let your dog wander around then call its name saying “Come (insert name).” When he or she comes praise it and give it a treat.
Work on this training for short periods of time (5-10 minutes) over the course of a week. When your dog is coming consistently to you, you can stop giving treats and only giving praise when it comes to you. It’s an invaluable and potentially lifesaving lesson to learn.
Every time your husky has a chance to run free, either by choice or by accident, it will learn that running free is fun and it will want to be free to run as much as possible. Limit this from a young age if possible.

, This is especially important around cats and other small animals the dog might mistake for prey. In order to manage your dog's natural instinct to hunt, you need to keep your dog contained, train it to respond to your commands immediately, and give it outlets for its energy.Keep a husky contained for its own safety and the safety of other animals in your area. Keep it on a leash when in public and make sure any yard it is free to roam in is fully fenced.Train your husky to come on command. If your dog is stalking prey or actually attacking another animal, it's important to be able to get the dog's attention and stop it from continuing bad behavior. Voice control over your dog's actions is of utmost importance. It can take a lot of work to get your dog really well trained but it is worth the effort.Give your dog a lot of outlets for its energy and its prey drive. On a regular basis play fetch or tug of war with your dog, or simply give it lots of toys to play with. If you can focus the dog's energy on fake prey instead of real prey, you lessen the chance the dog will attack another animal.Sometimes a husky and cat relationship can work out without a glitch, but often it is a constant management situation. If you are really skilled at keeping doors shut, gates locked, litter boxes cleaned, and protecting your cat at all times, you can probably have a cat and husky in the same house.
If you have poor management skills, don't get a husky if you already have a cat. Huskies and cats live together peacefully if they are each properly socialized and introduced to one another.

You may notice that the coughing is worse at night or when he's resting. Coughing is usually caused by fluid buildup in the lungs.Coughing may also be a result of an enlarged heart pushing up on your dog's windpipe.;
, If your dog is short of breath because of a heart condition, he'll breathe quickly. The lungs may be filled with fluid and his breaths may seem shallow and rapid. This is because the ability of his lungs to absorb oxygen is compromised.


Normally, a large-breed dog takes up to 25 breaths a minute at rest., If you take your dog for a run, check to see if he lags behind. The increased demands on the heart to pump blood throughout the body will cause your dog to slow down or even faint when he exercises. You should also check his heart rate to see if it's racing.


German Shepherds should have a heart rate of around 80 to 120 beats a minute. If your dog's heart is beating faster than this, it's considered to be racing, especially if he's not exercising at the time., In addition to not being excited about exercising, your German Shepherd may seem lethargic. This is because his heart is putting strain on the rest of his body to function. Your dog might not want attention and may even seem depressed.For example, your once playful dog may suddenly want to be on his own and resist going for walks.

, Look for a swollen and enlarged abdomen which is a sign that fluid is building up in the belly (distended belly). This fluid accumulates because the right side of the heart is struggling.You may also notice the membranes in your dog's mouth look blue or purple, instead of healthy pink.

, It's always important to watch for any weight loss or gain in your German Shepherd. Weight loss might be caused by your dog losing his appetite because of an underlying medical condition (like heart disease). Weight gain may also be caused by heart disease, even if it's less likely a symptom.It may be hard to tell if your dog has gained weight or is experiencing edema. Edema happens when your dog's tissues swell.

, Severe symptoms of heart disease in a German Shepherd may appear with no warning. These include fainting, collapse, or even sudden death. These may happen if your dog's heart can't pump enough blood to his brain.If your dog faints, the veterinarian may be able to prescribe medication to make his breathing easier. Don't wait to get medical treatment for your German Shepherd.

, If your German Shepherd has any symptoms of heart disease, take him to see the veterinarian. It's best to catch heart disease early on so you have more treatment options. Your veterinarian may recommend that you take your dog to a specialist for a specific diagnosis.


Since heart disease symptoms are similar even for a variety of diseases, it's important to get a proper diagnosis.

, The veterinarian will do a physical exam to check your German Shepherd's general body condition. Specifically, the vet will check your dog's pulse and use a stethoscope to listen to his lungs and heart. The vet will listen for heart murmurs which are caused by abnormal blood flow in the heart and for heart rhythm.


The vet will try to identify where the heart murmur is loudest. This can help determine what's causing the abnormal blood flow.

, If the vet hears no heart murmur or irregular heart beat, but suspects heart disease, your dog may need a proBNP blood test. This test shows the levels of a certain heart protein in your dog's blood stream. The higher the level means your dog's heart is distressed.If your dog has low levels of proBNP, this can rule out heart disease.

, If the vet does hear an irregular heartbeat, your dog may need an electrocardiogram (ECG). This records the electrical activity in the heart which are interpreted alongside an ultrasound scan of the heart. This way, the vet can check the electrical activity against a picture of your dog's heart to see how the heart valves close. The vet can measure the thickness of the heart walls and check for tumors or abnormalities within the heart.A skilled ultrasonographer can also see abnormal blood vessels or recognize blood vessels which are narrower than they should be. This can help make a diagnosis.
The ultrasonographer can also use a color-mode on the scan to watch the flow of blood through the heart. This helps identify where blood is flowing incorrectly and in what volumes.

, Your German Shepherd may have a hard time pumping blood throughout his body if his aorta is deformed. The aorta is the main artery leaving the heart. If the valve into the aorta is narrowed, as in AS, a backpressure is created in the heart making your dog work harder to circulate blood.Medication is the most common treatment for AS, which treats the irregular heart rhythm and may include antibiotics to prevent infection. Surgery is not recommended., Your German Shepherd may have a heart deformity that's causing a heart murmur or another health condition (like problems eating or with blood circulation). These deformities may include:


Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA): This is a temporary blood vessel in a fetal puppy that should close shortly after he's born. If it stays open, blood may bypass your dog's lungs.
Vascular ring anomaly (also known as persistent right aortic arch): This is another blood vessel that should close before your dog is born. If it stays open after birth, the vessel traps your dog's esophagus which makes it hard for him to swallow food down into his stomach.Mitral or tricuspid valve disease: These valves separate the heart's atria from the ventricles. If they don't fit perfectly together, then blood can leak in the wrong direction, causing a heart murmur.

, If your dog has abnormalities in the heart muscle itself, he may have dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. With Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), the heart muscle tires and becomes baggy. With hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle thickens, causing the chambers to get smaller and hold less blood.Treatment usually focuses on improving your dog's diet and exercise habits. Most vets don't recommend surgery unless your German Shepherd develops congestive heart failure.

, Older German Shepherds are prone to a vascular tumor (hemangiosarcoma) that attacks the vessels lining the heart. This tumor is the most common type in dogs and usually isn't noticed until it gets big enough to cause complications. Your dog may have abdominal swelling, irregular heartbeat, and anemia.Treatment for hemangiosarcoma is difficult. Veterinarians usually recommend chemotherapy and possibly draining the site of the tumor. Because the tumor is on the heart, treatment may only be able to add a few months to your dog's life."

Consider the causes of pancreatic enzyme deficiencies.",How to Diagnose Pancreatic Enzyme Deficiencies in German Shepherds," Your German Shepherd's stools can appear soft or semi-formed. It might seem like your dog has diarrhea, especially since he may be defecating more often than usual. EPI stools look bigger and runnier, containing a lot of moisture. The color will look like a strange mustard yellow or will be very pale.The stools may also look fatty which can attract scavenging birds.
A German Shepherd's stool should normally be brown, shaped like a sausage, and be compact enough to hold together if you were to pick it up.;
, Your German Shepherd's appetite might be great, but he may lose a lot of weight very quickly if he has EPI. At first, your dog might just struggle to keep weight on. But, as the condition progresses, he might lose weight so rapidly that you can see his bones through his coat.You'll need to pay extra care to your German Shepherd if his coat is long or thick, since it may hide weight loss.

, Your dog's coat might be in poor condition so it may feel harsh or look starry. The fur can feel dry, brittle, or dull. You may also be cleaning up more hair since your dog may shed more with EPI.Coat condition can worsen with EPI since many nutrients are lost through the stools. This also causes a vitamin imbalance that can dull your dog's coat.

, If your German Shepherd has EPI, he may eat his own feces (which is called coprophagia). Your dog is driven by instinct try to reclaim lost nutrients by eating his stool. In rare cases, your dog may try to eat non-food items like plants or dirt (this is known as pica).Don't punish or shame your dog if he does this. Instead, you might try to limit his access to the feces. For example, you might immediately remove or clean up the feces so he doesn't get a chance to eat it.

, You may be able to tell that something is wrong with your dog because his personality seems different. Your dog might become aggressive or appear nervous. EPI can cause these changes in behavior because your dog is being malnourished and is constantly hungry.


Because of this behavior, your German Shepherd might become more protective of his food and less tolerant of human intervention. He may not like being touched., Certain breeds are more likely to develop EPI because they inherit genes that cause the condition. Dogs that have the hereditary form of the disease start showing signs of a problem between the ages of 1 and 4 years old. Since most German Shepherds have this form, it's important to watch for signs of EPI if your dog is young.Dogs can also develop EPI later in life because of pancreatitis.
Collies and English Setters are also prone to developing EPI.

, If your dog has soft or loose stools for more than a few days, he'll need to be checked out by the vet. Quite a lot of damage can be done to the pancreas by the time you notice signs of EPI. The sooner your dog is diagnosed, the faster he can be treated and the better he'll feel.Your dog's symptoms can develop gradually or he may suddenly develop diarrhea and weight loss. These developments depend on how well the pancreas is coping with bacterial overgrowth., The vet will take your German Shepherd's medical history and ask about issues like worming and recent changes in diet. The vet will physical examine your dog, feeling his abdomen to check for bowel obstructions or cancer. These could interfere with digestion and cause the weight loss. If everything feels normal, the vet may run screening blood test to check blood count and organ function.


An initial blood screening can rule out other problems like lymphoma, liver, and kidney disease. At this point, the vet is ruling out what conditions are not affecting your dog., Once the vet has ruled out conditions your dog doesn't have, the vet will order another round of blood tests (checking trypsin-like activity, folate and cobalamin levels) to evaluate your German Shepherd's bowel function. This will tell the vet how healthy your dog's bowel is, if there's a bacterial overgrowth, or if he's deficient in the vitamin cobalamin.This information can help your vet make an EPI diagnosis.


Before blood tests were used, fecal tests were used to make an EPI diagnosis. Blood tests are now preferred because they're more accurate and comprehensive.

, While there's no way to cure the cause of the enzyme deficiencies, the symptoms can be managed by diet. The vet will recommend low-fat foods that suit your German Shepherd's digestive system. You'll also need to mix replacement digestive enzymes into every meal. This can help your dog digest food and absorb nutrients.


Many dogs also need a 3 to 4 week course of antibiotics to balance the gut bacteria. Your dog might need monthly injections of B vitamins to keep his bowel wall healthy., Your German Shepherd's pancreas lies alongside the portion of his gut that leaves the stomach (known as the duodenum). The pancreas squirts digestive juice out of narrow ducts into this part of the small intestine to help your dog process food and nutrients.


The pancreatic juices are specific to digesting fats and protein. They're made up of the enzymes amylase, lipase, and trypsin., Your dog's genetics and illnesses (like recurrent inflammation of the pancreas) which scar tissue can cause EPI. These can prevent the pancreas from making enough enzymes to break down fats and proteins in food.EPI can lead to an imbalance in the gut's pH, causing an overgrowth of bacteria. This can make it harder to digest food and lead to diarrhea.

Learn the physical characteristics of huskies.,
Understand the husky temperament.,
Prepare for howling.",How to Train and Care for Your New Siberian Husky Puppy4," As with any dog, it is valuable to know the important physical characteristics of the breed. Siberian huskies are sturdy dogs bred for physical labor in cold climates.


Males, on average, will grow to a height of 21 to 23.5 inches. They will weigh 45 to 60 pounds.Females will grow to to an average of 20 to 22 inches and will weigh 35 to 50 pounds.Huskies don't suffer from a lot of health problems. However, there are some conditions you should be aware of. In addition to eye problems, they also may develop hip and elbow dysplasia.This is when these joints become malformed, resulting in pain and trouble walking.
Huskies shed a lot, especially when the weather starts to get warm. Prepare to clean up a lot of dog hair.Barring accidents, you can expect your husky puppy to live an average of 12 to 15 years.You should be prepared to care for the dog for at least that long.
Huskies do not do well in extremely hot or humid conditions. You should rule out a move to Arizona or Florida any time in the near future., There are several personality and behavior characteristics that are helpful to know about as you train and socialize your new puppy.


Huskies are extremely energetic and free spirited. They are active, high-energy dogs that get bored easily.This is why your husky may damage your home or yard and destroy your possessions if left alone for a long period of time. This also makes them ill-suited for life in small apartments.Huskies are strong-willed and intelligent. This can make them great companions, but can also make them more difficult to train than other dogs.Huskies are friendly and loyal. They are pack animals and do best with a family rather than a single owner. They are also friendly with strangers., Huskies seldom bark, which is great news. The bad news is, they do tend to howl quite loudly.Proper training and exercise will minimize this behavior.But, especially early on, expect a lot of loud howling.

Transition your pregnant dog to puppy food early.,
Gradually offer your puppies puppy food.,
Encourage your pup to eat their puppy chow.,
Remove the mother while they feed on puppy chow.,
Keep a close eye on your pups.,
Switch the mother back to regular dog food at 4 weeks.,
Completely wean your puppies off their mother's milk.,
Mix dog replacement milk into their dry puppy chow.,
Consider using a blender.,
Feed the puppies 3 times a day during the puppy weaning process.",How to Wean Puppies," On one hand, you’ll need your pregnant bitch to gain roughly 15-20% of its original weight by the time it gives birth to its litter. Puppy food is high in protein and basic nutrients and as such will help your dog gain that much needed weight. With this in mind, you don’t want to cause your dog to gain too much weight. You might choose to begin feeding your pregnant pooch puppy food when you discover her pregnancy or if you know that your dog is prone to weight fluctuations, you might decide to wait until 2-3 weeks before its whelping (the birth).


Moreover, you should choose the puppy chow that you plan on feeding your puppies. This will make it easier for the puppies to transition to puppy food — in terms of their overall health and more specifically their GI balance.;
, Begin when they turn 3 weeks old. You won’t completely — cold turkey — wean them off of their mother. You’ll begin by giving them puppy food for approximately 10% of their daily caloric intake. They’ll continue to nurse off of their mother, while they get used to eating their puppy food. Over the next 2 to 3 weeks, you'll feed them puppy food more and more and they'll nurse less and less.


Do not rush weaning for any puppies that are slow to eat on their own. This can lead to malnourishment. It's better to let them continue to nurse from their mother and slow the puppy weaning process a bit., Most likely, if you place the puppy in front of its food, it will eat it. Some puppies, on rare occasions, may resist eating the puppy chow. Simply pick up the puppy and place it in front of its food. Do this once or twice. Eventually, your puppy will chow down on the food., Start by separating the puppies from their mother for 1 hour, 2 or 3 times a day. Take the mother to another part of the yard or house. Leave the puppies with their food bowls. They’ll undoubtedly whine at first. Eventually, they’ll learn that their food bowls contain delicious and healthy food. You are mimicking the process that occurs in the wild, so don’t feel bad., During the weaning process, monitor their health. Make sure that they are gaining weight equally. Check for vomit and diarrhea. Consult your veterinarian if any problems or questions arise., As with all the other steps, the key is gradual change. Begin by replacing 1/4 of her puppy food with her regular adult food. This will help her digestive system cope with the change and it will continue to give her milk the nutrients of the puppy chow. Over the next couple of weeks, switch her entirely back to her normal adult dog food., At around 7 weeks old your puppy should be completely weaned. They should also be eating dry puppy food and drinking water., You can purchase this milk from any pet supply store or your vet’s office. Soak the dry puppy food with dog replacement milk and put it in a large, shallow pan when the puppies begin to walk around at about 3 weeks of age. You want it to be accessible to the puppy. They won’t be able to get to the food, if you use a larger, deeper bowl.Dog replacement milk will provide extra nutrients and will help to keep the young puppies from choking on dry kibble when they start to sample the food.

, For puppies, this soggy mixture of puppy chow and replacement milk might still be too much. Take a blender and blend up their food until it is the consistency of human infant cereal. 2 cups of high quality dry puppy food, 12.5 oz liquid puppy milk replacer, and about a 2 cups of water, combined in a blender, will feed about 6 puppies.After 1-2 weeks, you can introduce them again to dry food.

, Puppies under six months of age should be fed 3 times daily; after 6 months, they may be fed 2 times a day.Make sure that you are feeding them at even increments and at the same time each day. You want to get your new puppy on an eating schedule. This will manage their food expectations and keep them from begging all the time. When you shift them to 2 meals a day, you can just get rid of the lunch (middle) meal.

Gather your supplies.,
Weigh the puppy.,
Measure out the correct amount of milk into a microwaveable bowl.,
Use the syringe to suck up the milk replacer.,
Attach the feeding tube to the syringe.,
Measure out the length of the tube you will insert into the puppy’s mouth.",How to Tube Feed a Puppy1," You will need a 12 cc syringe, a soft rubber feeding tube, and a 16-inch urethral catheter with a diameter of 5 French (for small dogs) and 8 French (for large dogs). These are the items you will use to create your feeding tube device. You will also need puppy milk replacer that contains goats milk, like ESBILAC®.


You can also buy an already assembled feeding tube from your local veterinary office or pet store.;
, You will need to determine the puppy’s weight so that you know how much milk replacer to give him. Place him on a scale to determine his weight. For every ounce of the puppy’s weight, give him 1 cc or ml of the milk replacer.

, Add one extra cc to be careful. You will want to heat the milk replacer up so that it is easier on the puppy’s stomach. Place the milk into the microwave for three to five seconds so that it reaches a lukewarm temperature.

, Draw the milk up until you have the measured amount of milk, plus one extra cc. The extra cc will be used to ensure that puppy doesn’t get any air bubbles, which could cause bloating or gas pain.


Once the syringe has drawn up all of the milk replacer, press down gently until a tiny drop comes out of the syringe. Doing this will ensure that the syringe is working properly.

, You will need to attach the end of the rubber feeding tube to the end of the syringe.

, To do this, place the tip of the rubber tube up against the side of the puppy’s bottom, or last, rib, and run the tube from there to the tip of the pup’s nose. Pinch the tube where it touches the puppy’s nose and make a mark there with a permanent marker. "

Be aware that epilepsy often presents in young dogs.,
Watch for distress.,
Look for sudden aggressive behavior.,
Monitor for seizures.,
Look for other odd behavior.,
Watch for clusters of seizures.",How to Diagnose Epilepsy in German Shepherds1," Epilepsy often occurs in young age. In German shepherds, typically the first seizure happens and the signs of epilepsy show from under one year of age to four years old.However, in some cases, the dog may be as old as six before presenting., Either before or after the seizures, your dog might show signs of distress. This might cause him to be vocal or whine. Your dog might also show signs of fear before or after a seizure., You should be aware that the abnormal electrical behavior in the brain can cause your German shepherd to behave strangely before, during, and after a seizure. This behavior can include being aggressive and attempting to bite in a dog that is otherwise sweet-tempered., The main symptom for canine epilepsy is seizures. German shepherds can have different types of seizures associated with their epilepsy. These are:


Focal seizures: Typified by highly localised bizarre behavior, such as repeatedly irrational rubbing of one part of the body in a compulsive way, or 'fly-catching' behavior where the dog snaps at invisible objects in the air. This are also known as partial seizures.Generalized seizures: These affect the whole body. The dog is unconscious and unaware of what's happening to him or around him. The dog is unable to stand and collapses to one side. The body goes rigid, the limbs often paddle, and the mouth may chomp. Typically this lasts for 30 seconds to three minutes, after which the dog recovers and regains consciousness.Status epilepticus: This is where the dog enters a seizure but does not wake up, and the seizure continues indefinitely. It is essential to seek veterinary attention as brain damage can occur during status epilepticus., If you are unfamiliar with seizures, you might not realize that your dog is having a seizure. Look for the following behavior in your dog:Confusion or disorientation
Aimless walking
Blindness
Increased thirst or appetite
Falling down onto his side
Becoming stiff
Salivating profusely
Urinating and defecating randomly

, Seizures often occur in cluster or groups, within a 24 hours period. German shepherds with epilepsy are prone to groups of seizures spaced apart. How frequent these groups are depends on the individual. For example, a dog with mild epilepsy may have one seizure every six months, whilst a severely affected individual may have groups of seizures every couple of weeks.


After the first seizure contact your vet, who can medicate your pet to make another seizure the same day less likely.

Feed your husky a balanced diet.,
Feed your husky a seasonal diet if it is an outdoor dog.,
Provide water for your husky at all times.",How to Take Care of a Siberian Husky4," In general, it's best to feed your husky a mixture of commercial dog food and raw food. They need a diet high in protein, so feeding a well-balanced commercial food combined with raw red meat can fulfill their dietary needs.You could spend a good portion of your life researching dog food and trying to figure out what is best. If you are unsure about what to feed your dog, consult with your veterinarian. He or she should have a good suggestion for you.
Never feed a dog cooked bones! They can splinter and injure, or kill, your dog. Raw bones, on the other hand, are great for a husky to chew on., A good rule to follow is to add fat and protein during the cold months and hard training, and to subtract fat and protein during the warm months. This may be as simple as feeding one brand of food in the winter and another in summer.


Only feed after exercise. Feeding before exercise puts your husky at risk of gastric bloat and torsion.This serious condition can kill a dog. A good rule to follow is to feed 30 minutes after exercise or four hours before exercise.

, Every dog needs unlimited access to water in order to stay healthy and hydrated. This is especially important to remember in cold climates and cold winter months, when water dishes may freeze. Ether move your dog's water dish into a warm area that it can always access or invest in a water system that will not freeze."
"
Enrich your husky's life with lots of activities.,
Keep your husky healthy.,
Decide whether your dog will live inside or outside.,
Set up a warm dog house if your husky spends time outdoors.",How to Take Care of a Siberian Husky5," This will help to keep your husky happy. Most mushing dogs get several miles of exercise four times a week. If you don't mush full time, you need a little help keeping your husky happy. Enrichment means something that engages your husky in an activity that uses his or her brain. Bones, toys that can be stuffed with food, buster cubes, doggy daycare, long hikes, and dog sports are all great ways to keep a husky happy.


Huskies are known as being escape artists. This really translates to a bored dog finding something better to do. If your husky is already an escape artist, or you want to avoid your husky learning to be an escape artist, they must get enrichment.
Huskies are capable of learning agility, fly ball, Frisbee, and other dog sports besides mushing.
One thing you can do to entertain you Husky is to design an agility course.

, Take your dog to get a veterinary exam on a regular basis. Your veterinarian can assess your dog's overall health and tell you what, if anything, to keep an eye on.


Also make sure your dog is flea and tick free. Fleas can cause skin irritations and carry parasites. You have to be diligent about combing through your husky’s dense fur coat to keep on top of a possible flea infestation.
Huskies that live outdoors are at a greater risk of parasite infestations and diseases. Make sure your husky has flea, tick, and heart worm protection, and has an annual veterinary checkup. These issues are easily prevented with timely veterinary visits.

, Huskies can live indoors like any other breed. Even mushers have started building dog barns (small horse style barns) for their teams. It has been discovered that dog teams recover better sleeping in the warmer barn versus sleeping outdoors during training. With training, your husky can be taught to live indoors.


Even though huskies function well in cold climates, they are not immune from the cold. You cannot leave a husky out in the cold all of the time. At the very least they need warm dog houses or other shelters to warm up from the cold.
In addition, you certainly do not want to leave a husky outside during very hot weather. A husky's thick coat does not allow them to cool down enough to survive in hot weather. If you live in a warm climate, do not have your husky live outside, as it needs protection from the heat.

, Huskies do get cold and need a warm dog house to head into during cold or rainy weather. The dog house needs to be weather proof including a leak proof roof and walls. It should be raised slightly off the ground (using bricks, paving stones, or treated lumber) so air can circulate underneath and to keep water from pooling.


A blanket or dry straw (changed/washed weekly) should also be placed inside the house.
In addition, the house should be small enough so the dog can retain body heat, yet large enough that it can stand and turn comfortably.

Insert the catheter slowly but efficiently.,
Feed the tube into the puppy’s mouth.,
Feed the puppy.,
Remove the tube.,
Help the puppy to defecate.,
Check the puppy for gas or bloating.,
Repeat this feeding process every two hours for the first five days.",How to Tube Feed a Puppy2," You should cover the table in a towel in case there is any spillage. Let the puppy lie down on all fours, so that she is lying on her belly with her front legs outstretched and her back legs tucked up under her. Put a drop of the formula on the inside of your wrist to make sure that it is lukewarm and not too hot.

, Hold the puppy’s head firmly in between your index finger and thumb so that your fingers are located at the corners of the puppy's mouth. Tip the head slightly upward so that you can see what you are doing. Hold the end of the tube on the puppy’s tongue and let her taste a drop of the milk. Doing this will help coat the esophagus and get her ready to eat., You will not want to go too slowly or else the pup may gag. Guide the tube over the tongue and down into the back of the throat. You will know you are on the right track when the puppy starts swallowing the tube. If she coughs or gags, remove the tube and try again., Stop feeding the tube downward once the marked part of the tube reaches the pup’s mouth. Check to make sure that the pup is not coughing, crying or gagging. If she is not, secure the tube by placing it between your index and middle fingers., After securing the feeding tube, depress the plunger of the syringe and feed the puppy one cc or ml at a time. To know when to let the puppy rest between cc’s, count to three seconds in your head while slowly depressing the plunger. After the three seconds, check to see if there is any milk coming out of the puppy’s nose. If there is, withdraw the tube as this means that the puppy is choking. After you have checked, depress the syringe for three more seconds.


Hold the syringe perpendicular to the puppy for the most efficient feeding method.

, Once all of the milk has been fed to the puppy, slowly remove the tube. To do this, gently pull it out while still holding the puppy’s head. Once the tube has been removed, place your pinky in the puppy’s mouth and let it suck on your finger for 5 to 10 seconds. Doing this ensures that the puppy will not throw up.

, If possible, bring the puppy to her mother. Her mother will lick the puppy’s anus, which will help the puppy to defecate. If the puppy is an orphan newborn, use a wet washcloth or cotton ball to simulate the mother’s licking. Doing this is very important, as defecating will help the puppy remove any waste dammed up in her intestines.

, Do to this, lift the puppy and stroke her belly. If it is very firm, she has gas or bloating. If this is the case, you will need to burp the puppy. To do this, lift the puppy by placing your palm under her belly and lifting up. Stroke her back and rump to help her to burp.

, After the five days are up, feed the puppy every three hours.

Provide your vet with a seizure log.,
Give a history.,
Perform blood tests.,
Rule out other conditions.,
Run a neuroscan.,
Eliminate all other conditions.,
Treat the condition.",How to Diagnose Epilepsy in German Shepherds2," It is important to keep a diary of how many seizures your dog has, and how often it has them. This guides the vet as to how strong the medication needs to be and if the dose is adequate.If at all possible, provide a video of the seizure for your vet to see.

, The vet starts by taking a history in order to rule out possible exposure to toxins which could cause seizures. Your vet will ask you various questions about your dog’s activities, places you two have gone walking, any places he may have gone alone, or materials he may have gotten into and ingested.

, Unfortunately, there is no single test that gives an answer as to whether the dog's seizures are epileptic. To diagnose epilepsy, the vet starts along a logical path to rule out all conditions that can cause seizure. After a history, the vet may perform screening blood tests.These trouble shoot organ function, so as to gain an idea of whether the liver, kidneys, and other organs are functioning normally or if there could be a problem which causes natural toxins to build up and trigger seizures.

, Based on the results of the blood tests, the vet may pursue clues. For example, if the blood creatinine levels are low, the vet may want to run additional liver function tests to rule out a portosystemic shunt. The vet may want to check blood thyroid levels since low thyroid hormone can trigger seizures.He may also look at blood electrolyte levels to check for abnormalities due to disease which could cause seizures.
If the vet is worried about infection, such as meningitis, causing seizures, he may collect a sample of the fluid which bathes the spine and brain and analyze that.

, If all the tests come back normal or negative, the final test is to run either an MRI or a CT scan. This provides a picture of the structure of the brain, and can rule out conditions such as a brain tumor or cysts on the brain., Since epilepsy is a diagnosis of exclusion condition, your vet will only diagnose epilepsy after ruling out everything else. Once all the other tests have come back normal, the vet can then definitively diagnose epilepsy., The treatment depends on the severity and frequency of the seizures. Anticonvulsant drugs are the mainstay of treatment. The aim of medication is to reduce the frequency and severity of the fits while maintaining the dog's quality of life.Anticonvulsant medications have side effects, which includes sedation, so the vet may suggest a compromise whereby the dog's fits are controlled but not totally eliminated, but he is not so sedated that his regular day to day life is not impeded.
The vet may also prescribe suppositories of diazepam to give your German shepherd during a seizure, to calm the brain waves and reduce the risk of another seizure breaking through in the footsteps of the first one.

"
"
Know how common epilepsy is.,
Understand the difference between epilepsy and seizures.,
Be aware of epilepsy requires a diagnosis of exclusion.",How to Diagnose Epilepsy in German Shepherds3," Figures suggest that epilepsy is relatively common. Out of every 200 dogs, one is likely to have epilepsy, which is the equivalent of a 0.5% incidence.German shepherds are at increased risk, which means that in a group of 200 German shepherds, more than the expected one dog could have epilepsy.

, It is important to understand that epilepsy is a condition, whereas the terms seizures or fits are symptoms. Seizures or fits are also not a diagnosis in their own right. Many people inaccurately use the words epilepsy and seizures interchangeably, but this in incorrect.A dog with epilepsy has seizures, but a dog who has seizures does not necessarily have epilepsy. Seizures can be triggered by a variety of different reasons. This is an important distinction to grasp, when wondering if your German shepherd has epilepsy or not.
In order to reach a diagnosis and start the dog on appropriate treatment, your vet will want to rule out all causes of seizures or fits.

, Epilepsy is described as uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain for which no explanation is found. This makes epilepsy a ""diagnosis of exclusion,"" which means that all other possible triggers for seizure activity have to be eliminated before a diagnosis of epilepsy can be made. This is only possible with exhaustive medical testing, including blood tests and an MRI scan to look at the structure of the dog's brain.As an owner, your first step is to recognize your dog is having seizures and take the dog to the vet.
You may have seen idiopathic epilepsy used when referring to the German shepherd. The word idiopathic means unknown cause, which is what epilepsy is, so strictly speaking, the word idiopathic is superfluous and not needed.

Clip your dog before it gives birth.,
Provide a comfortable space for your dog.,
Look for signs that your dog will give birth.,
Keep your vet updated.,
Look after your dog.",How to Whelp and Raise a Single Puppy1," About a week before your puppy’s expected birth date, you should clip your dog’s hair to prevent birth fluids – which are difficult to remove – from getting matted in it. Trim your dog’s hair around the vulva and belly using a pair of dog shears. The hair from the tail to ankles should be uniformly cut short., Like humans, dogs need to be comfortable and secure when giving birth. But the birthing process can also be messy, so you should provide a space for your dog that can be easily washed or discarded. For instance, if you have some scraps of carpet, you could lay them in one part of the room where the dog will give birth., When your dog is close to giving birth, she will stop eating for about 24 hours before whelping. Other signs include licking the vulva and mild abdominal cramping. You can detect abdominal pain due to your dog’s mild whimpering.Your dog might also shiver, pace back and forth, pant heavily, and vomit.Do not look for signs that may or may not appear. Specifically, some dogs experience a drop in rectal temperature when they are close to giving birth – from the normal temperature of 101-102 degrees Fahrenheit down to 100-101 degrees Fahrenheit. However, many dogs do not experience this drop in temperature. Whether you do or do not detect this drop in rectal temperature, there are other, more reliable signs that your dog is close to giving birth, so use those instead.
Look for the water sac. The water sac is a grayish, balloon-like blob that emerges from your dog’s vulva. Your dog might nip or tug at the sac, allowing the clear fluid to escape. This means your dog will give birth in about one hour.

, If it’s the first time your dog has had puppies, she might strain, and you might worry. However, just call your vet to inform them of the situation. Say to your vet, “My dog’s water sac is visible. I will update you on her progress.” Call back every 15 minutes or so to inform the vet about any progress your dog is making.Your vet should recommend that you bring the dog into the veterinary clinic if she hasn’t given birth after one hour or if she is yelping in extreme pain.Don’t worry if the puppy is born tail-first. Both head-first and tail-first are normal.
If you think your dog is experiencing anything abnormal, contact your vet immediately.
Your vet should already be apprised of your dog’s situation well in advance of her birth. Make sure you have a home or emergency number for your vet just in case your dog gives birth over the weekend or at night.

, A strong mother means a strong and healthy puppy. After your dog gives birth, she should be kept on fluids for 24 hours. Chicken broth and dog soups are the order of the day. Ensure your dog resumes normal activity soon after giving birth – including eating, looking after its puppy, and voiding (defecating and urinating) regularly.Your dog might get a mild fever for the first day or two after giving birth. However, the fever should not exhibit any symptoms. If it does spiral into a more serious fever, you’ll notice your dog vomiting, voiding indoors, and showing little interest in its puppy or its normal activities. Contact your vet if this is the case.
Feed your dog a puppy food. Puppy foods have a high calorie content that the new mother will need to recover from the act of giving birth. Continue feeding your dog in this way until your puppy is weaned.
Provide clean, fresh water daily.
Dark red, green, or bloody discharge might persist in small amounts for up to two months.
Check your dog’s mammary glands to ensure they are not hard, swollen, painful to your touch, or exuding pus. You should see a bit of milk dribble out of each teat when squeezed gently.

Feed puppies a healthy diet.,
Make sure your puppies get rest.,
Provide fresh water.,
Discourage unwanted behaviors.,
Groom your puppy regularly.",How to Take Care of Teacup Puppies1," Teacup puppies should be fed a diet rich in fiber. Look for canned or dry foods that contain ingredients like eggs, chicken, fruits, veggies, and omega 3 fatty acids. Also, make sure the dog food you choose contains Karo syrup. Teacup puppies are prone to low blood sugar and this ingredient can help counteract that.Talk to your vet about what kinds of puppy chow to purchase. They may have suggestions based on your puppy's specific breed.
The label of your chosen food should have feeding instructions that let you know how much a puppy should get each day.;
, Teacup puppies tend to play hard. They tend to feel very tired after activity, especially strenuous play. If your puppy is falling asleep, it is important you give it time to rest.Provide a comfortable bed for teacup puppies. After playing with your puppy, place it in its bed. Leave the puppy alone and let it rest for a few hours.
Teacup puppies need about 14 hours of sleep a day. Limit playtime to hour long sessions to keep your puppy rested.

, Teacup puppies are like any other dog in that they need fresh water out all the time. Make sure to provide a water bowl that your puppy can easily reach. Refill the water bowl each time you notice the water is murky or running low.


As teacup puppies are small, watch the size of the water bowl. Make sure it's short enough that your puppy can drink from it.

, You should start training a puppy right away so it learns good behavior. Many owners ignore negative behaviors from very small animals, as small dogs cannot cause as much damage. However, you want your puppy to be well behaved so make sure to discipline it for doing things chewing household objects, unwanted barking, going to the bathroom inside, and being aggressive towards people or other animals.If a teacup puppy engages in bad behavior, simply say ""No"" firmly and then ignore the behavior until it stops. If you are consistent, your teacup puppy will eventually learn which behaviors are inappropriate.
You should not scold, yell at, or isolate a teacup puppy as punishment. This is ineffective and will only create stress.

, How often you need to groom your puppy depends on its age. Shorthaired teacup breeds, like some chihuahuas, will not need grooming as often as longhaired breeds like Yorkshire terriers and toy poodles.Longhaired puppies should be brushed as their hair becomes tangled with a slick brush. You should also clip out any mated fur during the brushing process.
Short haired puppies only need a light brushing on occasion.

Identify any risk factors the mother dog may have.,
Have an ultrasound done on your pregnant dog.,
Look for symptoms of anasarca on a newborn puppy.,
Give immediate care.,
Take the puppy to a veterinarian immediately.,
Treat the fluid retention.,
Give the puppy palliative care.",How to Treat Newborn Puppies with Edema (Water Puppies)," While it is not known exactly what causes anasarca, some dog breeds are more likely to get the condition. Your puppy has more of a chance to develop anasarca it is a brachycephalic breed. This type of dog has a short, compressed snout and wide skull, and includes bulldogs, Boston terrier, and pugs for example.If you have a brachycephalic dog that you are breeding, you should make sure the dog is getting proper prenatal care. However, because the condition is not totally understood, even with proper care the puppies may be born with anasarca.;
, In order to assess whether a pregnancy is going well, your veterinarian may want to do an ultrasound. With an ultrasound your veterinarian may be able to assess whether any of the puppies have anasarca.Even with a clear ultrasound, one or some of the puppies may be born with anasarca. This condition can develop at any point in the pregnancy but often occurs very late in the pregnancy., If one or more of the puppies have anasarca is will be clear after birth. The puppies will be physically swollen, sometimes being two to four times bigger than other puppies in the litter without the condition.Puppies with anasarca can become so big that they get stuck in the birth canal. These puppies will need to be born via cesarean section., Make sure to hold the puppies' head up and extend its neck, so that its airway is as clear as possible.Also keep the puppy warm and try to stimulate urination by running your finger across its genitalia every couple of minutes.


This should be continued until the puppy is under veterinary supervision.

, For a puppy with anasarca to have a chance of survival, it needs to be treated by a veterinarian. If your dog gave birth at home, then you need to take the puppy to a veterinary office right away.


If your normal veterinary office is closed when the mother dog gives birth, then you should take the affected puppy to the closest veterinary hospital.

, As soon as a puppy is born with anasarca it should begin treatment to stand any chance of survival. Treatment usually includes giving the puppy a diuretic to reduce the amount of fluid the puppy is retaining. Puppies with this condition are also usually given potassium and their temperature is raised to 100 °F (37.8 °C).The bodies of puppies with anasarca are also gently massaged to promote circulation.
If the condition is mild, the puppies can go on to live normal lives.
Even with prompt treatment, however, a puppy with a severe case of anasarca has a very slim chance of survival.

, If the puppy has a severe case of anasarca, it has a very low chance of survive. If this is the case with your puppy, then you should focus on making sure it is comfortable and pain free instead of focusing on recovery.Consult with your veterinarian about the health of the puppy and whether it has any chance of recovery. If it doesn't, then your veterinarian will have some suggestions about how to stop the puppies' suffering. This could include keeping it warm and giving it medication to alleviate any pain. In some cases, this could mean compassionate euthanasia.
Prepare yourself that the outcome may be death. In many cases of anasarca, the puppy is still born or dies quickly after birth.

Remove the fluid membrane.,
Use a syringe to remove visible fluid.,
Clear fluid from the lungs.",How to Whelp and Raise a Single Puppy2," When your dog produces its puppy, the puppy will be covered in a thin membrane (the placental sac). This is the sac that it grows in while gestating inside your dog. Your dog should instinctually remove this membrane from the puppy. However, if your dog doesn’t remove the membrane almost immediately, the puppy could suffocate. Watch the situation and remove the membrane yourself if necessary.To remove the membrane, simply wipe the puppy’s face with a damp cloth. The membrane is not unlike plastic wrap, and tears easily. Wiping your puppy’s face will poke a hole in the membrane and allow your puppy room to wriggle free. If your puppy remains partially stuck in the membrane, manually pull bits of it away until your puppy is free and clear., If your puppy is coughing, it might have placental fluid in its mouth. Check its mouth and throat for fluid. If you see any, use a bulb syringe to remove it. Gently open your puppy’s mouth with one hand and squeeze the bulbous end of the bulb syringe with your other. Insert the pointed end of the syringe into your puppy’s mouth and gently release the bulbous end of the bulb syringe so that it sucks up any liquid in your puppy’s mouth., If your pup is making a raspy noise, swing it with a gentle rocking motion. This rasping is caused by fluid collecting in the puppy’s lungs. To remove this fluid, place the puppy in the palm of your hand with its face cradled snugly between your middle and index fingers. Cup your other hand securely over the puppy’s body and make a downward swinging motion with the puppy still in your hands. This will allow the fluid to clear from the lungs.You might need to do this several times to help the puppy stop rasping.

Dry your puppy.,
Cut the puppy’s umbilical cord.,
Put your dog and puppy in a whelping box.",How to Whelp and Raise a Single Puppy3," Your puppy will be wet from coming down the birth canal and floating in placental fluid. Use a soft, warm towel to dry your puppy’s hair and stimulate circulation. Be gentle when drying your puppy, as it is quite vulnerable to injury at this early stage., The umbilical cord is a long tube connecting the puppy’s abdomen to the mother’s uterus. While your doggie is pregnant, the umbilical cord carries nutrients to the developing puppy. But after the puppy is born, there is no need for the umbilical cord. Your dog should gnaw the umbilical cord until it comes off.But in the event that your dog doesn’t, you should do it yourself.Measure the umbilical cord away from the puppy’s body to a length of ½ an inch (1 centimeter). Tie the cord with a piece of thread or unwaxed dental floss so that it is squeezed slightly. Snip the cord at the place where you tied it. The remaining bit will shrivel up and drop off in a few days.

, A whelping box is like a doghouse that accommodates a dog and her new puppy. It should be in a safe location inside the house and provide enough room for your dog to lie down. You can buy or make a whelping box.Sturdy, reusable whelping boxes are best if you intend to have other dogs give birth. Disposable whelping boxes of cardboard are best if your dog will not have any more puppies.
Whelping boxes should have sides that are tall enough to contain puppies, but low enough that your dog can enter and exit at will. For instance, perhaps your whelping box is a square-shaped affair with sides of 15 inches (38 centimeters) on three sides and 4 inches (10 centimeters) on the fourth side.
If you’re making your own whelping box, line it with a large plastic bag and place warm towels or blankets on top of it. Do not add wood shavings as a substrate for the whelping box.
Once your dog is secure with the puppy in the whelping box, she should begin nursing. If your dog does not begin nursing, contact your vet.
Keep the whelping box clean. Change the towels/sheets as needed.

Allow your puppy to sleep.,
Keep the puppy warm.,
Keep your dog and puppy together.,
Start grooming your pup weekly.,
Take your pup to the vet.,
Begin setting boundaries.,
Socialize your puppy.,
Introduce food to your puppy.",How to Whelp and Raise a Single Puppy4," Puppies will spend most (90%) of their time sleeping. The other 10% of their time will be spent eating. Don’t insist that your puppy wake up and play with you, or try to teach it tricks at this early stage. As the old saying goes, “Let sleeping dogs lie.”, Puppies are sensitive to heat and cold. Your whelping box should be about 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29.5 degrees Celsius). Use a heat lamp suspended above the whelping box to keep the whelping box toasty. Measure the temperature within the box using a thermometer.You might need to adjust the distance of the heat lamp from the whelping box in order to achieve the desired temperature. For instance, if it’s too cold, move the lamp closer to the whelping box. If it’s too hot in the whelping box, remove the heat lamp some distance away.
After a week, drop the temperature of the whelping box around 80-83 degrees Fahrenheit (26.5-28 degrees Celsius).

, In its first days and weeks of life, your puppy will need constant care from its mother while awake. These early experiences will help your puppy develop positive socialization skills and stay healthy., After two weeks, you should start taking a close look at particular grooming and hygiene issues that will need ongoing care. Specifically, you should find time to brush your dog’s teeth, trim its nails, and brush its coat.


Trim your pup’s nails weekly. Trimming the nails can be traumatic for adults, but if you begin trimming your puppy’s nails, it will learn that trimming is an easy process that they can expect regularly. Start trimming your puppy’s nails after it is two weeks old. You can use regular human nail trimming scissors to trim your puppy’s nails.Older dogs usually need specialty trimmers like guillotine trimmers to get their nails cut. Puppies have softer nails, though, and don’t need special trimmers.Puppy teeth start coming in after two weeks.

, If there are no immediate health issues, you don’t need to take your pup to the vet until it is six weeks old. At that point, it will be ready for several vaccinations, including distemper, Bordetella, parainfluenza, and measles.Over the course of the next few months, your puppy will need to receive additional shots and get regular checkups.
If you have any questions about how to raise your puppy, ask your doctor when you visit. For instance, you might ask, “What sort of food should I give my puppy?” or “When should I begin giving my puppy exercise?”

, Puppies form habits that can be very hard to break later in life. If you don’t want your adult dog to enter a certain area of the house, don’t allow them to enter it as puppies. If you don’t want your adult dog to jump up and beg at the dining table, don’t allow them to do it as puppies.If your puppy does something you don’t want it to, say, “No” sternly. Set your puppy in its crate or another area where you want it to run and play.

, If you have a single puppy and its only company is its mother, it will get lonely and bored without having another dog with an equal amount of energy. Contact friends who also have puppies so your pups can play together. Set up a playdate and let them romp in an enclosed space like the backyard.A variety of socialization experiences help your puppy develop a healthy temperament and a sense of self-confidence.
However, do not take your pup to the dog park – you don’t know what sorts of dogs your puppy might encounter there.

, After two weeks, your pup will start showing teeth. Start replacing one of your puppy’s meals with a bowl of milk replacer each day. Look for specialty puppy foods at your pet store and ensure that your puppy’s food is soft and mushy.You can soften food that you think is not soft enough by mixing it with a few spoonfuls of water.
After your pup is three weeks old, you can begin to feed it standard meals of puppy dog food.

Have puppies vaccinated and dewormed.,
Talk to your vet about dental care.,
Schedule more frequent vet visits.",How to Take Care of Teacup Puppies2," As soon as you get a teacup puppy from a shelter or breeder, take it to a vet. If your puppy has not already received a full round of vaccinations, get it vaccinated to prevent diseases like rabies. If your puppy has not been checked for worms, bring in a stool sample to have it evaluated for parasites. If your puppy does have worms, your vet can apply a deworming treatment.If you found your puppy at an animal shelter, there is an increased risk of worms. It's important to bring a stool sample to your vet to check.

, Teacup puppies tend to have very fragile bones. This can make them prone to dental issues. Have your puppy's teeth examined by a veterinarian. If your vet believes your puppy is at risk for dental issues, they will go over treatment options with you.Your vet may suggest special food or treats.
Your vet may also want you to brush your teacup puppy's teeth regularly.

, Unfortunately, due to their small size, teacup puppies can be very fragile. Your puppy may be prone to heart and lung problems, in addition to issues with bone density. While your puppy is growing, you will need to see a vet more frequently to make sure your puppy is heathy. Your vet can let you know how often you should bring your puppy in. The precise number of visits depends on your puppy's current health, breed, and age."

Protect your dog from trauma.,
Monitor children's interaction with teacup puppies carefully.,
Be careful when taking your pet outdoors.",How to Take Care of Teacup Puppies3," Teacup puppies are very delicate. You should be very careful when holding a teacup puppy. If a teacup puppy is dropped, this could cause serious damage. Be very careful to handle your teacup puppy gently. You should only hold your puppy when necessary and avoid holding it up too high off the ground., Children may play rough with puppies, which can easily injure a teacup. Watch young children carefully as they handle a teacup puppy and step in if they're getting too rough.It may be a bad idea to get a teacup puppy if you have very young children.

, Teacup puppies are more vulnerable to hazards like cars and other dogs. They are also at risk for being stepped on if they get underfoot. Make sure to keep a close eye on your puppy during walks to keep track of where it is. Gently pull on the leash to direct it away from other dogs or oncoming traffic."

Inspect the puppy for further physical development after two weeks.,
Make sure the puppy is getting socialization at three weeks old.,
Start weaning the puppy by four weeks old.,
Begin house training at four to five weeks old.,
Assess whether the puppy is ready to go to a new home at seven to eight weeks old.",How to Track the Development of New Puppies," When a puppy is born you should assess its physical and behavioral status. This will allow you to know if it is on the right developmental track.Look over the puppies to make sure they do not have any obvious birth defects. Check the mouth, anus and skull for abnormalities. Cleft palates, which are deformities of the upper lip shelf, and “swimmer” bodies, characterized by flattened and widened chests, are common.Make sure the puppies are breathing on their own.
Check that the puppies are staying close to the mother for warmth and that they are feeding. If they don't automatically suckle, encourage them to do so by placing them on the hind teats. If they are still having issues suckling, consult a vet--you may have to bottle feed them.;
, The neonatal stage is the first week after birth. A newborn puppy is both blind and deaf during the neonatal phase. It is normal for a puppy to have closed eyes and move around very little. In fact, it is a puppy's sense of smell that allows it to find the mother in order to stay warm and feed.In addition, the puppy will not be able to go to the bathroom on its own. The mother dog needs to promote urine and feces elimination during this phase. This is done by the mother dog licking the genitals of the puppy.

, From birth to two weeks old the dog only responds to warmth, touch, and smell. The puppy can't regulate its own body temperature, so it relies on its mother to keep it warm. If the puppy is eating a lot and keeping close to its mother, then this is a good developmental sign.You should not have to handle the puppy very much in the first couple weeks of life. It's behavior should consist of eating and sleeping mostly.

, If you do not think that your puppy is developing properly, then you should talk to your vet about it. For example, if you don't think that your puppy is suckling enough or you find that it is not staying close to the mother, and thus not staying warm, then you may need to supplement its food or warmth.

, About five to seven days after birth, the puppy should begin to crawl around. Its eyes should open between five and 14 days after birth, and its ears should open between six and 14 days after birth.During this period, the puppy will spend less time cuddled up with its mother and more time exploring its surroundings.

, After about a week, your puppy should try to stand up. It will usually take the puppy another week or so to begin walking, which will be wobbly and uncoordinated at first.Once the puppy begins walking, it will explore its surroundings even more.
If your puppy is not standing at all after a week, then you should have it looked at by a veterinarian. This could be a sign that its development is delayed and you should try to find out why.

, Baby teeth, also known as milk teeth, should begin to show up in your puppy's mouth at 14 to 21 days old.Additionally, after two weeks the puppy should be able to eliminate its waste on its own.


Also, your puppy should begin wagging its tail and playing with its litter mates when it is over two weeks old. These are good signs that show it is on a good developmental path.

, During the socialization period, which occurs between seven weeks and four months, it is critical for the puppy to be exposed to a variety of people, animals, and environments. Successfully socializing the puppy requires effort on your part, but will impact the dog's personality and comfort in new situations for the rest of its life.During this socialization phase, the puppy should be walking easily and playing with its littermates, in addition to interacting with others.
Introduce your puppy to new people, sights, sounds, smells, and textures. Have your puppy meet people of different ages and people wearing different types of clothing, like sunglasses or baseball caps. Allow your puppy to walk on different types of floors, like carpet and tile. Gradually introduce new stimuli so your puppy does not become overwhelmed.Puppy classes, dog parks, and friend’s houses are great opportunities for socialization, but avoid taking your puppy to public places like these until after it has completed its vaccination series., At four weeks old, the puppy should have all of its baby teeth, which can irritate the mother.You should gradually switch the puppy to a diet of puppy food. A slow transition is key because it allows the puppy's digestive system to adjust to digesting the puppy food instead of its mother's milk., Once the dog is about a month old, you can begin house training. This usually takes four to six months, but may take up to a year for some puppies.At this point the puppy should still be around its mother. Taking the puppy out when the mother goes outside to go to the bathroom can be good modeling for the puppy.
Note that smaller breeds have smaller bladders and faster metabolisms, and therefore will need to go outside more frequently. As a result, smaller breeds often take longer to house train. Be patient, and don’t expect too much too soon., Many puppies go to their permanent homes when they are about eight weeks old. If your puppy is fully weaned, playing and active with its littermates, and has a clean bill of health, then it is probably ready to go to its forever home. This is a point in the puppy's development that it can adjust to changes and bond with new humans.


There are some breeders that wait until about twelve weeks to send their dogs to their new homes. Sometimes, this is merely a matter of choice. Other times, puppies may need a little longer than 8 weeks to mature, especially small breed puppies."

Watch for pain in the hips.,
Look for lameness affecting the back end.,
Check for muscle atrophy.,
Monitor for movement hesitation or reluctance.,
Look for narrow hips.",How to Diagnose Dysplasia in German Shepherds1," A common sign of hip dysplasia is painful hips. You may hear whining when your dog walks, or see a decreased level of activity.Your dog may have a tendency to rest the sore leg when standing. He may also move back on forth from one leg to the other.
Some dogs may react aggressively if you go to stroke or touch the hip area because of pain.
In young dogs, the first sign of pain might be that the German shepherd has difficulty climbing stairs or jumping into a car. They may also not be able to run and exercise freely, as you would expect in a young dog.;
, Dogs can present at a young age, from six to 12 months, with sudden back end lameness. Other dogs may not present until they are middle aged as their mobility gradually worsens as they age.The lameness may be worse after periods of exercise.Lameness can affect just one leg if one side is worse or both back legs.
Your dog may stand with a markedly dropped back end. He may also move in a bunny-hop manner, swinging both back legs forward as the same time instead of moving them independently.If your dog is an older dog, he may walk with a limp.

, When you look at your dog from behind, you may notice there is muscle wastage on the most severely affected leg. You may also notice muscle atrophy of the thighs.Because of this, the shoulder muscles may be larger because they will take up the slack.

, Your dog may hesitate before he moves his back legs. For example, he may hesitate or take longer to push himself up when he’s sitting on his back legs. He may also hesitate to run or jump.Your dog may have trouble squatting when he goes to the bathroom. He may also fall over when trying to use the bathroom., Many dogs with hip dysplasia have narrow hips, and their back legs are spaced extremely close together."

""On a deeper level, when we pay close attention, dogs mirror us back to ourselves in unmistakable ways that, if we are open, foster understanding and change.""
""You can't become a better trainer without becoming a better human being."";
, Dogs are very perceptive and will pick up on your negative emotions. Before training your dog, take a few deep breaths and clear your mind. Visualize the training session you're about to have with your dog. When you feel calm and ready, proceed.

,, Use gentle looks to foster acceptance and trust. Use piercing and sustained eye contact when your dog has done something it should not do, and knows it should not do (such as snapping at strangers).

, It's not just a set of exercises contained within sessions, though that is important.

, Learn about wolf behavior. Investigate the breed of your dog, and what that breed was intended to do.

, Many people use praise to ""bribe"" their dog, and that's something a dog can easily see through. Praise your dog generously and genuinely. Find out what kind of praise animates your dog; experiment! Use both physical and verbal praise.


""Praise is an attitude, a stance. Dogs who live in an atmosphere of praise come to love the human voice. They are more trusting and accepting. They are approachable by strangers but not demanding. Dogs confident of praise from their owners do not live o the edge of an emotional abyss, always seeking out attention and sulking when they do not get it. If praise is part of your attitude toward your dog, you have a rich and exciting relationship ahead.""

,


Never call a dog to you to discipline him. Always go to the dog, even if it means you have to chase him.
Don't use objects to discipline or punish.
Don't use your dog's name when correcting behavior.
Discipline in proportion to the offense. Verbal discipline and leash corrections can fix most offenses.
Make eye contact as you discipline.
Be dramatic.
Stop paying attention to the dog for about 30 minutes after a stern correction. Just be passive and avoid eye contact, you do not need to be aggressive or vocal at all. Then make up with your dog by taking him for a walk or giving him his favorite toy. It doesn't have to be dramatic, just resume your normal relationship.
""Watch yourself - owners who are physically or verbally domineering wind up with cringing, neurotic dogs. Discipline, like praise, must be meaningful. It must communicate the owner's displeasure clearly, and on the dog's level of understanding and perception, for unacceptable behavior.""

If your Rottweiler’s joints are bothering him, he’ll start slowing down or completely avoid certain activities. For example, he might be unable to handle long walks, and may refuse to go on walks at all.In addition, he may be more reluctant to go up and down stairs.If your Rottweiler used to excitedly greet you at the door, he might walk more slowly toward the door, or simply stay where he is.;
, Rottweilers with hip dysplasia have a characteristic ‘bunny hop’ gait, during which the back legs move at the same time, rather than one at a time.With elbow dysplasia, your Rottweiler may have a ‘paddling’ gait (legs swinging out to the side) if both front legs are painful.Limping is common with either form of dysplasia.


Your Rottweiler might have a stiff walk first thing in the morning. This initial stiffness usually goes away as the day goes on.With elbow dysplasia, your Rottweiler will have trouble flexing and extending his front legs, which likely contributes to the paddling action., Elbow dysplasia occurs when the radius and ulna (the two bones below the elbow) grow at uneven rates in the front legs. This unevenness causes the bones to fit improperly into the elbow joint, creating pressure and pain. Your Rottweiler will try to relieve this discomfort by twisting the affected leg out to one side. Unfortunately, twisting the leg out worsens the dysplasia., Your vet will perform a full physical exam, then perform a more focused orthopedic exam. During the orthopedic exam, your vet will move your Rottweiler’s legs and joints in different directions, as well as watch how your Rottweiler walks (and runs, if possible).


X-rays will help your vet see how much your Rottweiler’s joints have been affected by the dysplasia. Since your Rottweiler may be in a lot of pain, he will need to be sedated for the x-rays.On an x-ray for hip dysplasia, the top of femur (thigh bone) does not fit into the hip socket,and may have extra bone growth.For elbow dysplasia, your vet would see bone fragments in the joint.Realize that joint degeneration and pain do not always go together. For example, a painful dog that can’t walk very well may have only mild joint degeneration., Dysplasia treatment is divided into medical (non-surgical) and surgical. Controlled exercise is an effective form of medical treatment, since it can maintain muscle tone, improve joint stability, and improve range of motion. Short walks and swimming are great low-impact exercises for your Rottweiler. How much exercise he can handle will involve some trial and error.Try to walk your Rottweiler on the grass, which provides more cushioning than asphalt.Avoid high-impact activities, like running and jumping.Exercise your Rottweiler every day.Talk with your vet about long each exercise session should be.

, Large dogs put more pressure on their joints. Rottweiler’s are naturally large dogs, so if your Rottweiler is carrying around extra weight, he’s putting even more pressure on his joints. Help him lose weight by switching him to a reduced calorie diet, which you can purchase through your vet or at your local pet store.


If you’ve been feeding him store-bought treats, which tend to be high in fat, switch him to healthy treats or take treats out of his diet entirely. Carrot sticks and orange slices are healthy treats.Daily exercise will help your Rottweiler lose weight.
Weight loss in dogs should be gradual. Your vet can determine your Rottweiler’s ideal weight and how long it should take him to reach that weight.

, Dietary supplements called nutraceuticals have become increasingly popular for treating joint problems in dogs.Nutraceuticals containing chondroitin and/or glucosamine, which are effective at repairing damaged joint cartilage, are commonly used in dogs.Omega-3 fatty acids help improve joint health.Many nutraceuticals are available, but not all of them are high in quality. Ask your vet to recommend high-quality products for your Rottweiler.

, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to reduce joint pain and inflammation in dogs. Long-term NSAID use can cause digestive problems such as gastrointestinal bleeding, so your vet will probably not have your Rottweiler on NSAIDs throughout his life.While your Rottweiler is on NSAIDS, your vet will run blood tests to check his liver and kidney function.Tramadol relieves pain and doesn’t have many side effects. Steroids reduce pain and inflammation, but can cause serious side effects, such as weight gain and weakened bones.Whichever medication your vet prescribes, follow the prescription instructions carefully.

, Physical therapy and massage are effective at improving muscle tone and enhancing blood flow in joints.Your vet can recommend various physical therapy exercises for you to perform on your Rottweiler at home.


A massage can feel like a little piece of heaven to your Rottweiler. Make the massage area quiet and comfortable. When you massage him, use gentle pressure around his joints.It may take a while for your Rottweiler to get used to the massage. Be patient as he gets accustomed to you touching him in this way.

, Your Rottweiler will appreciate a warm and comfortable place to sleep if he has dysplasia. Consider purchasing an orthopedic foam bed, which will be easy for him to get into and out of and will not create painful pressure points around his joints. Place the bed in a warm and draft-free area of your home.When your Rottweiler is not in his bed, you could use heating pads around his joints to warm him up and relieve pain. Wrap the heating pad in a towel to prevent his skin burns.Limit the use of the heating pad to 15 or 20 minutes.

, Surgery is frequently recommended for elbow dysplasia. The main goals for elbow dysplasia surgery are to correct unevenness between the radius and ulna and repair joint damage.Several different types of elbow dysplasia surgery are available, including total elbow replacement.Several surgical options also exist for hip dysplasia, including total hip replacement or removal of the head (top) of the femur.Your vet will be able to recommend the ideal surgery for your Rottweiler.
Obese dogs typically do not make good candidates for surgery.If your Rottweiler is obese, your vet may recommend that he lose a certain amount of weight before having surgery.
Depending on the complexity of the surgical procedure, your vet may refer you to a veterinary surgeon.

, Surgery may be the best option for your Rottweiler’s dysplasia, but it is not be risk free. For example, surgery to remove the head of the femur can result in decreased range of motion and loss of muscle mass.Potential complications of a total hip replacement are hip dislocation and nerve injury.With total elbow replacement, there is a risk of the surgical plate or screws breaking or dislocating.Your Rottweiler may or may not develop complications after surgery. However, it is good to understand the risks before moving forward with surgical treatment.

, When you take your Rottweiler home after surgery, you will need to restrict his exercise and keep him away from stairs and slippery surfaces. Do not allow him to play with other dogs.In addition, you should perform the recommended physical therapy exercises and engage in low-impact exercises (e.g., short walks).Your vet will prescribe pain medications for your Rottweiler after surgery.
Your vet will want to see your Rottweiler after surgery to take out his sutures (if necessary), and assess the improvement of the dysplasia.

Take your German shepherd to the vet.,
Examine the dog’s mobility.,
Provide a health history.,
Perform a physical exam.,
Get any additional exams.,
Treat the condition.",How to Diagnose Dysplasia in German Shepherds2," If you notice that your German shepherd has any mobility issues, take him to the vet. You want to find out if it is due to hip dysplasia or another related issue., One of the first things your vet will do is watch the way your dog moves. The vet will watch him walk and run, and also examine how the dog copes with stairs. This will help the vet to see which leg is most painful and how badly affected it is.

, One of the things your vet may need is a health history. This will include the dog’s overall health, when the symptoms started, and any past injuries.The vet may also ask for breeding information to find any genetic connections.

, The vet will perform a physical examination. The exam includes testing your dog's nerve reflexes by turning the paw upside down and pinching the toes. This helps to ascertain that the problem is physical with the joints rather than neurological with the nerves.The vet will then carefully manipulate the legs, flexing and extending each joint to test if the movement is normal or restricted. This also helps to confirm which areas are tender or sore.
Your vet may also draw blood and take a urine sample.

, Based on the exam, the vet may suggest taking radiographs of the dog's hip joints. This is best done under anesthetic because to take meaningful x-rays means putting the dog's legs in positions which would be too painful for the conscious dog.While the dog is anesthetized and relaxed, the vet can perform special tests that involve testing the amount of movement out of the joint to see if it is within normal limits or not. A joint which moves out of joint a significant amount is going to be more painful, because the bones are constantly banging against each other.
One problem with diagnosing hip dysplasia is that the radiographs need to be interpreted in light of the clinical signs, such as lameness, and the amount of the discomfort the dog is in.

, Hip dysplasia is a painful condition, so your vet will prescribe pain relief for long term use. Typically this is a medication from the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory (NSAID) family.Your vet may recommend physical therapy for the joints, and exercises good for hip dysplasia, like swimming.
If the problem is severe, there are a number of surgical procedures which can be done. These range from a femoral head excisions, where the femoral head is removed so it no longer bangs against the acetabulum, to a total hip replacement."

Start early and short.,
Reward your pet.,
Learn the right kinds of commands.,
Be consistent.,
Train for the right amount of time.",How to Train Your Rottweiler Puppy with Simple Commands1," Puppies can be taught simple commands starting at seven to eight weeks of age. The key to training is to make each session fun and short. A minute or two for each month of age up to 6 months is a good ballpark figure. Trying to do more than that will not benefit you or the dog because his attention span can’t handle it., Reward based training is one of the most positive and effective way to train your Rottweiler puppy. Positive reinforcement, such as a small piece of a tasty treat or lavish praise, should be given immediately when the puppy obeys the command. Keep a bag of small, tasty treats handy, such as tiny cubes of cheese or very small pieces of cooked chicken, to immediately reward your pup for any steps towards learning the new command or cue.


Once the puppy is consistently obeying your command, the treats can be given intermittently then gradually phased out, replaced with consistent praise.
If you fail to reward immediately, the puppy will become confused as to what you expect from her or him., The commands used need to be short, one or at the most two words. Keep your voice friendly. Always praise your puppy for any attempt in the right direction, and absolutely never yell or hit your puppy. Your pup is obeying you because he wants to please you at this point, so remind him that he is pleasing you with his obedience.

, Each of these principles can be used for all the commands you use for training. The key to the reward system is to reward immediately, be consistent, and use simple command words. The best time to conduct a training session is when the puppy is relaxed and alert. Never train when the puppy is sleepy, wound up, or not feeling well. You want his mind completely on the training session and his attention on you.

, When you start training your dog, perform the commands for 10 to 15 minutes at a time. During this time period, spread out which commands you teach. Try five to 15 repetitions of one command, then move on to another one and do five to 15 repetitions of it. Once the time is over, reward your pet and praise him. You can do this up to three times a day with different commands.


You should also start with shorter time periods he has to stay in each command as well. When you are first teaching him to sit, for example, try to make him sit for three seconds before rewarding him. As he learns, move the time up, increasing until he can stay for 30 seconds or longer."

Understand that dysplasia can occur is a variety of places on the body.",How to Diagnose Dysplasia in Rottweilers," For young dogs, the first sign is usually that the dog has wobbly rear legs, has difficulty climbing stairs, or is unable to jump into a car. It may also not be able to run and exercise easily, as you would expect a young dog to do.


Dogs that are 6 - 12 months old can present with sudden back end lameness, or their symptoms may just gradually worsen.;
, If both hips are affected, the dog may stand with a clearly dropped rear end. It may also move in a bunny-hop motion, swinging both back legs forward at the same time instead of moving them independently., Pain may cause the Rottweiler to be less tolerant than it was previously.


Rottweilers need a lot of exercise. If they are unable to do this they can grow bored and may display a tendency toward aggression.
Some dogs may react aggressively because of pain, if you go to stroke or touch the hip area.

, In older dogs, the key symptom of dysplasia is back end lameness. Thus, a dog may walk with a limp and when you look at it from behind you may notice there is less muscle mass on the most severely affected leg.Dogs with hip dysplasia have a tendency to rest the sore leg when standing. They may also exhibit hesitation before moving from a standing position.

, If you notice your Rottweiler has mobility issues, then the next step is a vet check. The vet will watch the dog walking, running, and how it copes with stairs. This will help the vet to see which leg is most painful and how badly affected it is.


The vet then performs a physical examination, which also includes testing the dog's nerve reflexes by turning the paw upside down and pinching the toes. This helps to if the problem is physical (with the joints) or neurological (with the nerves.)
The vet then carefully manipulates the legs, flexing and extending each joint to test if the movement is normal or restricted. This also helps to confirm which areas are tender or sore.

, Based on this exam, the vet may suggest taking x-rays of the dog's hip joints. This is best done under anesthetic, because meaningful x-rays require the vet to put the dog's legs in positions which would be too painful for a conscious dog. Any time a dog is put under anesthesia there is a risk to the dog's health and an added cost that you will need to approve.


Also, while the dog is anesthetized and relaxed, the vet can perform special tests. These involve testing the amount of movement out of the joint to see if it is within normal limits or not. A bone that has moved out of its joint is going to be more painful, because the bones are constantly banging against each other.

, To reach a diagnosis of hip dysplasia the x-rays must show problems associated with hip dysplasia and the dog must have a long-term lameness problem. One problem with diagnosing hip dysplasia is that the x-rays need to be interpreted in light of the physical symptoms (lameness) and amount of the discomfort the dog is in.


Some dogs have what appears to be poor hip anatomy that is discovered by accident when the dog is radiographed for a different reason, and yet they have no lameness or apparent pain in the hips.
The vet assesses the x-rays by looking at things like the shape of the femoral head (round vs square), how deeply the femur sits in the hip bone, and the angle at which the femoral head joins onto the thigh bone. The latter matters because dysplastic hips often have a poor angle which means when the thigh muscles contract they pull at an odd angle., Hip dysplasia is a painful condition and so your vet will prescribe pain relief for long-term use. Typically this is a medication from the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory (NSAID) family.


If the problem is severe, there are a number of surgical procedures which can be done. These range from a femoral head excisions (where the femoral head is removed so it no longer bangs against the acetabulum) to a total hip replacement., It is important not to breed dogs that have hip dysplasia, as it will be passed onto their puppies. To reduce the incidence of hip dysplasia, good breeders now screen breeding stock for the condition. Thus, only dogs screened by the Orthopaedic Foundation for Animals and found to have good hips scores should be used for breeding.By breeding from Rottweiler's with healthy hips, in time, the breed's health will improve and countless owners will be spared the heartbreak of seeing an active dog struggling to move and in constant pain.Make sure any Rottweiler puppy you purchase comes from a reputable breeder who actually follows these guidelines. This is important for the future health of a dog you adopt. It is also important to avoid supporting breeders who continue to encourage this problem through bad breeding practices.

, The deterioration can be hastened by a poor diet that is not balanced to provide the slow, sustained bone growth of a large breed such as a Rottweiler. To this end, it is best to feed a special diet designed for ""large breed growth."", Excessive amounts of exercise in a puppy can also make the joints more vulnerable to damage. This can accelerate the onset of the disability caused by dysplasia.Try to give your dog low-impact exercise. This means exercise that is easier on the joints, such as walking or swimming. This will allow the dog to burn off some of its energy, while not threatening the future health of its joints.Older dogs with bad joints need to have controlled amounts of exercise as well, but they usually do not have the energy or youthful enthusiasm that makes this kind of exercise likely.

, This is the abnormal development of the joints, usually as a result of genetic disease being passed down from parent to pup. A healthy hip joint is a ball and socket design, which consists of a round femoral head (the top of the thigh bone) fitting neatly in the acetabulum (the cup on the pelvis which forms the hip joint), so that the hip joint moves smoothly without any grating or bumping.A dysplastic hip joint has a number of features including a poorly shaped femoral head that has flat edges or is square-shaped, sitting in a shallow acetabulum. This means when the hip moves it catches and rubs, which causes discomfort and pain., Dysplasia is a slowly progressive disease, where poor joint anatomy gradually deteriorates over time with the development of secondary arthritis.As the animal ages, the continued trauma to the hip joint causes premature arthritic changes with new bone being laid down. This compounds the problem and impedes hip movement even more.Remember, dogs as young as 6 months can be affected. Don't assume that problems in a young dog cannot be dysplasia.

, In the Rottweiler, it is the hip joints that are commonly affected. In other breeds different joints may be affected, such as the elbows in Labrador retrievers."

Determine whether medical treatment is right for your Rottweiler.,
Restrict your Rottweiler’s activity.,
Give your Rottweiler pain medication.,
Add joint health supplements to your Rottweiler’s diet.,
Manage your Rottweiler’s weight.,
Perform physical therapy.",How to Treat Osteochondrosis Dissecans in Rottweilers1," After diagnosing your Rottweiler with OCD, your vet will discuss various treatment options with you. Medical treatment is effective with mild OCD, when the articular cartilage is cracked or there is only a small cartilage flap in the joint.It’s also recommended for dogs that are not good surgical candidates (weak immune system, heart disease).Talk with your vet to decide if medical treatment is a good choice for your Rottweiler.;
, If medical treatment is right for your Rottweiler, you will need to restrict its physical activity for at least several weeks after diagnosis. This will help the damaged cartilage heal in the affected joint. Limit your Rottweiler’s activity to short leash walks. Other than walks, your Rottweiler should rest as much as possible.Do not play any high-intensity games, like fetch, with your Rottweiler.
Dogs with OCD are usually reluctant to play and exercise, so it probably won't be hard for you to limit your Rottweiler's activity., Pain is a common sign of OCD. To help your Rottweiler feel more comfortable, your vet will prescribe a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which will reduce pain by reducing joint inflammation. Examples of NSAIDs are carprofen and meloxicam.If your Rottweiler doesn’t like taking pills, try hiding the pill in a treat.
NSAIDs can affect a dog’s liver and kidneys. While your Rottweiler is on NSAIDs, your vet will want to take periodic blood samples to check liver and kidney function., Several supplements are available that can improve your Rottweiler’s joint health. These supplements frequently contain chondroitin and/or glucosamine. Chondroitin is naturally found in the body and is a component of cartilage.Glucosamine also occurs naturally in the body and helps build cartilage.In addition to glucosamine and chondroitin, omega 3-fatty acids support joint health by reducing inflammation.Joint health supplements are available at your local pet store or through your vet.
Talk with your vet before adding supplements to your Rottweiler’s diet. They can give you recommendations on high-quality supplements.

, Excess weight puts more pressure on joints. If your Rottweiler is overweight, this can worsen its OCD. Help your Rottweiler lose weight by feeding it a weight loss food, available through your vet or at your local pet store.


Be aware that over-the-counter weight loss foods may not provide your Rottweiler with the same level of nutrition as prescription weight loss foods.Limit your Rottweiler’s treats. Rather than feeding your Rottweiler store-bought treats, which can be high in fat, feed it healthy treats (unbuttered popcorn, orange slices).Exercise is also important for weight loss. Choose low-impact exercise, like leisurely walks, to help your Rottweiler lose weight.

, Your vet will recommend doing passive range-of-motion exercises to prevent your Rottweiler’s joints from becoming too stiff. To perform these exercises, lie your Rottweiler on its side and gently move the affected joint through its normal range of motion.Your vet will prescribe exercises depending on which joint (shoulder, elbow, ankle) is affected.
Perform the exercises five to ten times, two to three times each day."

Teach ‘No bite’.,
Command ‘No chew’.,
Tell him to be ‘Quiet’.,
Teach ‘No’ or ‘Stop’.,
Command ‘Sit’.,
Tell him to get ‘Down’.,
Teach ‘Stay’.,
Tell him to ‘Come’.,
Command ‘Paw’.",How to Train Your Rottweiler Puppy with Simple Commands2," The first training sessions should be to teach the puppy not to bite. You should have plenty of toys for your Rottweiler puppy on hand at all times. Puppies go through a teething stage and will bite your fingers or hand during play. If he does nip, say “No bite.” Play act that the puppy has hurt you, with mock yelping or squealing. After that, get up and leave. This gives the dog the message that biting ends the game. Avoid tapping a puppy on the nose as this will over excite him and make him more likely to bite.

, Chewing is a natural behavior for a puppy, but it can be destructive on a household. Diversion from an item you don’t want chewed to another you would rather the puppy chew on works well. For example, if you find your puppy chewing on a book, take the book away, put it out reach, and give them a toy to chew on. As remove the book, say “no chew.” Your puppy will eventually understand what he can and cannot chew., You may want your puppy to bark when visitors or un-welcomed guests come to your home. However, your puppy should learn the command “Quiet” for those times when barking is a nuisance. Keep your bag of small treats with you at all times and when the puppy begins to bark, say “Quiet.” When the puppy hushes immediately, give him the reward so he associates the word “Quiet” with stopping barking.


This may take some time, but he will eventually understand that you expect him to hush when you say quiet. Consistency and patience is the key in making this work for the both of you., It is important for your dog to learn the meaning of 'no' or 'stop'. You can use either one, but the use of it must be consistent. Rottweiler puppies are very playful and love mouth items. If your puppy nibbles on you or things other than toys or picks up items he shouldn’t, it is very, very important for him to learn 'no!' or 'stop'.


When teaching this to your puppy, always be firm and consistent. Once you have voiced the command, immediately move your dog away from whatever it is doing and once again say 'stop'. Walk away from your puppy, but don't take your eye off of him. If he goes back, repeat this process. This will be frustrating but you must do it. Otherwise, your puppy will grow up not knowing right from wrong. , After learning the “no” or “stop” command, you will want to teach your Rottweiler how to 'Sit'. Sitting makes grooming, feeding, playing, and relaxing much easier. It is also one of the easiest things to teach. Put a treat in your hand, letting the puppy see the treat. Have your puppy stand in front of you and firmly say 'sit'. Hold the treat on a level with the puppy's nose, then gently arc the treat backwards over his head. As he follows the treat with his nose to try and get it, his bottom will sink to the ground. Immediately say ""Sit"" to label the behavior he has just learned, and give the treat. It is good practice to have your puppy sit before placing his food down for him to eat. This teaches him ‘table’ manners.


While he is sitting, shower him with praise, such as “good puppy” or “smart puppy”, while saying the word 'sit' a few times. Repeat this process by moving away from your puppy, turning to face him, making sure you have his full attention, and tell him to ‘sit’. Praise him as you did before.
Work on the sit command for five to seven days until he is sitting promptly and consistently without the treat reward., Once he has learned to sit, you can teach him the ‘Down’ command. Put the puppy in the sit position while putting a treat in your hand. Make sure he knows you have the treat in your hand, and put your hand near his nose. While moving your hand to the floor say ‘down’ or ‘lay down’. The puppy will follow your hand to the floor by starting to lay down. As soon as he does, give the treat and praise him. He may make partial attempts at first, but he’ll get it.


Practice this new command for up to a week until he has thoroughly learned it.
The ‘Down’ command can he useful if your puppy is a jumper. Jumping on people can be a problem with puppies as they try to get your attention. If your puppy is a jumper, keep a leash on him to be able to correct him with ‘down’ as he starts to jump. Then give him the command to ‘sit’. Reward him when he promptly responds with a tasty treat. He will soon learn that jumping is not an acceptable behavior., Rottweilers will always want to be in your company. He will always want to be next to you, around you, or even on you. But he will eventually get in your way. Teaching your Rottweiler puppy to ‘stay’ keeps him from getting in the way of you, other people, and other dogs. Tell your dog to 'sit' first, as it is much easier to have him sit and allow him to ‘stay’. Once he sits, praise him and put your hand in front of his face, wide open like a stop sign. Firmly say 'stay', then back away slowly.


He will most likely run up it to you, but have him sit again. Then put your hand in front of him once again, say 'stay', back away while all the while repeating ‘stay’. If he runs up to you, you will have to do it again. Once he stays, don't let him come to you. Instead, go to him, praise him, and give him a treat.
Repeat this process while going farther away from him than you did the previous time until your puppy is consistently staying., A very important command to learn is ‘come.’ If your puppy is ever running toward danger or in danger while away from you, a puppy that has a solid understanding of the ‘come’ command can be quickly recalled to your side. While your puppy is away from you, crouch down, slap your thighs and say ‘come’ in a friendly voice. No doubt your puppy will run to you eager to play with you. Reward him with a little treat and a bit of play.


Work on this command at various times for a few weeks. If your puppy is far away from you, slap your thighs and say 'come' in an appealing, happy voice. Once he comes to you, praise him and repeat the word 'come' a few times. Then, throw a treat and or a toy far away from you and watch him run after it. Once he gets there, tell your dog to 'come' again. He might not do it at first, but you'll have to repeat it.
If necessary, always have a treat or a toy that he loves more than the one you threw. Wave it to him once he looks up and say 'come!'. Once he comes over, praise and repeat. A little work and effort on your part will help your puppy retain this very important command., Teaching your dog to 'paw' is also an easy and useful command. If you plan on clipping or filing your Rottweiler's nails, this is necessary. Have your puppy sit, then say 'paw' and reach down, take his paw in your hand and then praise and pet him. Repeat this process four times and then ask your dog to 'paw' without you lifting his paw. If he is able to do it, praise him and give him a treat.


Paw is just as easy as ‘sit’ and it should not take long to learn."

Let your vet perform surgery.,
Care for your Rottweiler after surgery.",How to Treat Osteochondrosis Dissecans in Rottweilers2," Surgery is usually the treatment of choice for OCD in dogs.It can also be used if medical therapy does not work.Several types of surgical procedures are available to treat OCD in Rottweilers. Your vet will determine which of the following procedures will be best for your Rottweiler:Removal of the cartilage flap: Removing the flap will allow scar cartilage to develop and reduce some of the joint inflammation. However, the joint will still be abnormal, and your Rottweiler could eventually develop arthritis.
Arthrodesis: This is the fusion of two bones to prevent painful joint movement.
Total joint replacement: This is a ‘last resort’ procedure for cases of chronic or extensive OCD, when there isn’t much healthy articular cartilage left.

, After you and your vet have agreed on a surgical procedure for your Rottweiler, you will schedule an appointment for the surgery. To prepare your Rottweiler for surgery, do not feed it 12 hours before surgery or allow it to drink water 8 hours before surgery. This will prevent your dog from vomiting during surgery and having the vomit enter its lungs.You will probably bring your Rottweiler home on the same day of surgery. Either the vet or the vet's staff will call you to let you know when you can pick up your Rottweiler.

, Surgery will help relieve a lot of your Rottweiler’s pain. When you pick up your Rottweiler after surgery, your vet will give you specific at-home care instructions so your Rottweiler can have a full recovery. Your vet will also prescribe at least several days' worth of pain medication for your Rottweiler.Other at-home instructions may include:Short leash walks and passive range-of-motion exercises for two to three weeks after surgery
Increased amount of exercise and physical therapy after three weeks

The subsequent pain and discomfort will likely keep him from being able to move around like he used to. For example, if he used to run and greet you at the door, he may now walk slowly towards the door or just stay where he is. If he used to walk up and down the stairs easily, arthritis may make him more cautious about using the stairs.When he wakes up in the morning, or after a long nap, you may notice it takes him longer to stand up and get moving.You may also notice him walking with a limp, indicating he is favoring one leg over another.;
, Joint pain and discomfort can take more than just a physical toll on your Rottweiler. He may become less alert.In addition, he may become less interested in playing and start sleeping more.Your Rottweiler may also become grouchy.If your Rottweiler is not able to make it outside, he may start having accidents in your home., Arthritis can cause a dog to lose weight (due to a loss of appetite) or gain weight.To assess your Rottweiler’s body condition, you will examine certain body parts, including his ribs, spine, hips, and waist. If he has gained a lot of weight, you will not be able to feel his ribs, spine, or hips. In addition, you won’t be able to see his waist.Weight gain can put even more stress on your Rottweiler’s joints, worsening his arthritis.
Losing weight will produce the opposite results. His bones and waist would be very visible, indicating a loss of fat in those areas.

, If left untreated, arthritis can decrease the range of motion in your Rottweiler’s joints, which could eventually lead to a loss of muscle tone and loose ligaments (structures that connect bones to each other). If you notice signs of arthritis lasting for 2 or more weeks, take your Rottweiler to your veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment. Your veterinarian will examine your Rottweiler’s joints and take x-rays to determine the location and severity of the arthritis.During your appointment, provide as much information as you can about your Rottweiler’s symptoms and any other changes you’ve noticed.

, Arthritis can be difficult to treat and manage, so it will be important for you to know what treatments are available.Arthritis treatment commonly involves several strategies, including weight management, exercise, pain control, and physical therapy.Nutritional supplements (e.g., glucosamine, omega-3 fatty acids) can also help treat arthritis by improving joint health and reducing joint inflammation.In severe cases of arthritis, surgical treatment (e.g., joint fusion, joint replacement) may be needed., Arthritis does not look the same from one dog to the other, so treatment must be individualized.Your veterinarian will consider several factors, including your Rottweiler’s weight, mobility, and severity of arthritis, when making treatment recommendations. You should consider your time availability, as well as financial resources, when devising the treatment plan with your veterinarian.


Discuss any concerns you may have about the treatment plan with your veterinarian. For example, if cost is an issue, he or she may able to recommend more affordable treatments.
Treating your Rottweiler’s arthritis could become a long-term commitment.

, Medications to relieve pain and inflammation are key to treating arthritis. Veterinarians commonly prescribe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; e.g., carprofen, meloxicam, deracoxib) for dogs with arthritis. Digestive problems (e.g., vomiting, gastrointestinal bleeding, loss of appetite) can occur with long-term NSAID usage, so your veterinarian may not have your Rottweiler on an NSAID for a long time., If your Rottweiler is overweight, losing weight will take some pressure off his joints and help relieve his arthritis. Since he won’t be able to do high-intensity exercises, weight loss should occur through dietary changes. The overall goal for the dietary changes is reduced caloric intake.


Dietary changes include switching him to a weight loss diet (available at your local pet store or through your veterinarian) and not feeding him table scraps.Switch his food out gradually so he does not develop digestive upset with the new food.
You can also swap out high-calorie store-bought treats for fresh, healthy treats (e.g., banana and apple slices).Simply feeding him less of his usual diet is not a good idea, since he may start missing out on key nutrients.Ask your veterinarian what your Rottweiler’s ideal weight should be. Try weighing him once or twice a month to see if he is losing weight. If he is not losing weight, talk with your veterinarian about other weight loss strategies.

, Nutraceuticals, which are non-prescription food supplements, have gained popularity for treating arthritic dogs.Nutraceuticals containing chondroitin and/or glucosamine, which help repair damaged joint cartilage, are widely used.Several other supplements are available, including omega-3 fatty acids (anti-inflammatory function) and MSM (anti-inflammatory and pain reduction functions).Not all supplements are created equal, so talk with your veterinarian before adding them to your Rottweiler’s diet.

, Exercise is a very beneficial treatment strategy for arthritis, since it improves mobility and flexibility, and builds muscle.Exercises should be low impact to minimize the wear and tear on your Rottweiler’s joints. Examples of good exercises are walking and slow jogging on grass, swimming, and going up and down stairs.Your veterinarian can recommend exercises that will be relatively easy for your Rottweiler to do.
Each exercise session should last about 15 to 20 minutes. Aim for two exercise sessions per day.Consider massaging your Rottweiler’s muscles before and after each exercise session.

, Massage and physical therapy are great for relaxing your Rottweiler’s stiff muscles, improving range of motion in his joints, and improving his muscle circulation.You can give your dog a fully body massage, or just focus on the arthritic area—your dog will likely appreciate the massage either way!


To massage the arthritic area, lightly stroke the area with your hands. Next, use your palm to apply gentle pressure on the muscles around the joint (not the joint itself). Complete the massage by lightly stroking the area again.Make the massage area comfortable by playing soft music, eliminating distractions, and placing a few layers of thick blankets on the ground.If you have never given your Rottweiler a massage before, he may not be comfortable with it at first. Be patient with him as he gets used to your touch.
Your veterinarian will recommend various physical therapy exercises for your Rottweiler.If you are unsure how to perform them on your own, ask your veterinarian to demonstrate them for you.

, Making your Rottweiler’s environment more comfortable is not exactly a treatment, but it will help him feel better. For example, elevate his food and water bowls so he does not have to bend down so far to eat and drink. In addition, build or purchase a ramp so he can go up and down stairs or get into and out of your car.Consider purchasing an orthopedic foam bed, which distributes weight evenly, doesn’t create painful pressure points, and is easy to get into and out of. Put some extra blankets on the bed to keep your Rottweiler warm."

Take notice of any limping.,
Watch for avoidance of activities.,
Look for signs of pain.,
Watch for stiffness.,
Watch for mood changes.",How to Diagnose Arthritis in Rottweilers1," Most signs of arthritis are related to mobility. Often one particular joint is affected more than the others, and this can lead to your dog limping or standing with less weight on the sore leg than his other legs.However, in the early stages, your dog can often run freely and forget about the discomfort when he sees something to chase after. Therefore, it can appear that the lameness comes and goes and is worse before a walk than during the walk.
A dog with arthritis has a tendency to be worse the day after vigorous exercise. He may chase happily after a ball one day, but the next day when the joint is still inflamed, he will often limp more than before.;
, Arthritis can cause your dog to avoid activities she once enjoyed. Your dog may be reluctant to go for her favorite walk or refuse to jump into your vehicle or on furniture., Arthritis causes pain for your dog. Look for whining when he walks. Your dog may also nip at you or seem upset when you touch the affected area., If your dog has an early stage of arthritis, she will often be stiff when she has been resting for a while, such as first thing in the morning or after sleeping. She may spend time stretching and padding around in a stilted way before her joints and muscles warm up and she can move more freely., Pain and discomfort can also affect your dog's mood. Pain can make an animal withdrawn or depressed and change his habits. Pain can also make your dog short-tempered and prone to snapping or aggressive behavior, so a change in his behavior should trigger you to look for an underlying problem, like arthritis."

Consult a professional trainer.",How to Care for Rottweilers," Mistreated Rottweilers have given the breed an overall bad reputation, leading some cities to ban the breed, some apartment communities to restrict them, and some insurance companies to refuse homeowner’s policies to those who own them.Research your area to ensure that owning a Rottweiler is both legal and responsible for your circumstances.


Begin by looking into your lease with your apartment community for any breed restrictions. If you own a house, then check with your homeowner’s insurance policy provider, as well as any homeowner’s association rules.
No states have banned Rottweilers, but a number of cities and townships have.Try contacting a representative from your local mayor’s office or the office of a member of the city council for any municipal codes in your area pertaining to Rottweilers.;
, A good breeder will be in good standing with the American Rottweiler Club and follow its list of mandatory practices, which includes screening all breeding dogs for genetic diseases prone to the breed.You can find breeders and related information on the AKC Breeders Page.


Also check your local animal shelter or Rottweiler rescue. Plenty of purebred, wonderful Rottweilers end up in these places because their owners didn't know how to correctly care for them.

, Make sure that your dog has had all of the necessary immunizations in order to keep both the dog and you healthy. The standard immunizations include rabies—which is administered at twelve weeks of age or older—and then every one to three years depending on your local laws and your vet’s recommendations. Distemper, parvovirus, hepatitis, and para influenza are usually administered together.Puppies should receive a set of four injections every three weeks starting at six weeks of age and then annually, as adults, again based on your veterinarian's recommendations.
Your veterinarian will also make recommendations for items such as monthly heartworm preventive, flea & tick preventive, and deworming protocols based on the season and specific region you live in., Spaying and neutering are procedures that prevent unwanted pregnancies and can help to eliminate many health and behavioral issues. Ideally a Rottweiler puppy should have this done at around six months of age. Discuss this procedure with your veterinarian during your regular puppy visits or at the first visit after adopting an adult dog.Neutering can prevent testicular cancers, prostate problems, urinary marking, and some aggressive behaviors in males.Spayed females have a greatly reduced incidence of mammary tumors (If desexed before their second season) and no possibility of uterine infections or uterine cancer., If a puppy, feed your Rottweiler a diet labeled specifically for large-breed puppies to ensure healthy bones and joints as the puppy grows. As an adult, find a high-quality food with meat as the first ingredient listed on the bag's label. Crude protein should be no less than 30 percent and crude fat no less than 20 percent. The fiber content needs to be 4 percent or less.


Rottweilers are susceptible to gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), which is a dangerous accumulation of gas in the stomach. To help prevent this life-threatening condition, feed two or three smaller, non-fatty meals a day (not in elevated bowls) and don’t mix dry food and water. Try to restrict your pup’s activity for at least an hour after feeding.It is always important to allow your dog access to a fresh, clean water source. Keep a hand towel nearby for wiping up excessive drool or slobber that, unfortunately, is a common occurrence for this breed. While you should always have clean water available for your Rottweiler, stop the dog from drinking large amounts at one time since it can also lead to GDV.
Remember that as your pup grows, Rottweilers can weigh up to 135 pounds—though your dog is likelier to average around 90-110 pounds.Ensure that you have plenty of space for such a large dog!

, Rottweilers tend to have short, smooth hair that requires less brushing than many breeds—roughly twice a week.The best type of brush to use on your dog is a rubber hound mitt or soft bristle brush.In general, the coat is easy to maintain, but the breed will shed much more than you would think.Invest in lint rollers for your furniture and clothes if shedding becomes an issue for you.

, Your Rottweiler’s short hair also means less frequent bathing. Bathe as necessary, such as if your pup decides to roll around outside.During bath time, also use an ear cleaner to flush out your dog's ears.Do not use a cotton swab to remove the waxy debris from the ear. Use a cotton ball or a paper towel wrapped around one of your fingers instead., Long nails on your dog can easily lead to discomfort or injury while running or digging or even from catching on your carpet. At the ideal length, you won’t hear the clicking of the nails across hard-surface flooring.Also be careful not to trim your Rottweiler’s nails too short since trimming to the quick can cause bleeding and pain for your dog. If you’re unfamiliar, consult your vet before the first time you trim your dog’s nails for the ideal point at which to clip them.

, Though an often-forgotten part of caring for a dog, dental care is important. It can also help cut down on the possibility of expensive vet bills later on due to costly tooth extractions. Consult your vet for an approved toothpaste and brush as directed by the product., Rottweilers are large dogs that need plenty of exercise. You should take your dog on at least two walks a day, each lasting ten to twenty minutes.Without exercise, you may have a bored and potentially destructive dog on your hands. This could come in the form of chewed-on furniture in your home or massive holes dug in your yard.


Some Rottweilers prefer to be lazy dogs that are happy lounging on the couch all day with no desire to be exercised. In that type of situation, although there may be less work involved for you, it is easy for a Rottweiler to become overweight, which can lead to a variety of health issues, such as diabetes and injuries to their knees and hips.
Rottweilers have a natural tendency to play rough, so do not be surprised if your Rottweiler plays and romps with vigor and occasionally sends things flying, including people. Have fun with your pup during exercise, but be careful too!, In addition to walks, you also want to spend some time each day playing with your Rottweiler. Playing fetch and tug of war are two easy games that your dog will pick up quickly. Training and puzzle toys can be a great backyard or in-home option for some added mind stimulation. These types of toys can easily be found at your local pet supply store.


Remember that a Rottweiler is a big dog. Choose toys that aren’t so small they’ll create a choking hazard for your dog.
For more information on teaching your Rottweiler games, check out How to Play with Your Dog.
Rottweilers also bond very closely to their owners, so be ready for plenty of affection as well.

, Rottweilers are prone to certain health concerns. Some of the more common ones include parvovirus, hip dysplasia, osteosarcoma, entropion, diabetes, gastric torsion, ruptured cruciate ligaments, skin tumors, and muscle and nerve diseases. Most of these concerns are treatable. Some may only require a simple medication while others may need to be corrected with a surgical procedure. Consult with your veterinarian about any health concerns you may have regarding your Rottweiler.Routine physical exams, which can include fecal exams, a heartworm test, and routine blood work, will help detect any health issues that need to be addressed in order to maintain your Rottweiler's long-term health.
If cared for properly and in good health, your Rottweiler can be a loving companion for up to ten or even twelve years., Training and socializing your Rottweiler are two of the most important parts of owning the breed, and the process should start before the puppy even leaves the breeder.Well-socialized pups are accustomed to many different sounds and actions going on around them, and your presence shouldn’t be a big surprise.


A shy, withdrawn, or overly cautious pup is probably not well socialized and has not been exposed to a lot of different situations. A less socialized pup may make just as good a pet as one who isn’t, simply requiring more time when training., Exposing your Rottweiler to other people, animals, and locations as young as possible is another great way to help socialize the breed. If at a dog park, slowly introduce your dog to the other dogs and people around you while still on the leash. If your dog seems to be friendly and comfortable and welcomes the interaction, offer praise for the good behavior and gradually allow more interaction off leash and in larger areas.


If possible, you should also enroll the puppy in “kindergarten” obedience classes starting around ten or twelve weeks old., Each dog will develop social skills at his or her own speed, so go as slow as needed. As your dog becomes more socialized and comfortable with new things, you will see that he or she develops an overall better temperament. Don't forget to introduce cats, children, and anything else that you want your dog to be familiar and comfortable with as well., In addition to socializing your Rottweiler, you’ll also need to do plenty of obedience training, which can require dedication and patience. Your Rottweiler will need to know that you are the dominant one in the relationship. This role can be especially difficult to master for first-time dog owners.


Obedience schools can be a good option from the very beginning or to correct unwanted behaviors.
It will be beneficial for you and your new pup to train with voice commands as well as hand signals. The upside to training with both of these commands is that if you are in a situation where your dog can't hear you, your hand signal will still communicate what you’re asking to the dog.

, Positive reinforcement goes a long way with this breed as Rottweilers enjoy pleasing their owners. After bonding to you, your dog will love your attention, so ignoring your dog when he or she exhibits bad behavior will work better than other disciplinary measures.

, During any sort of training, if you feel overwhelmed or your dog doesn't seem to be learning at a reasonable pace, consult a professional trainer or canine behaviorist. They will be able to answer any questions or concerns you may be having about the process or techniques that you are using."

Limit your Golden Retriever’s time outside.,
Minimize exposure to dust and dust mites.,
Reduce mold levels in your home.",How to Treat Skin Allergies in Golden Retrievers1," One of the best ways to treat CAD is to reduce exposure to environmental allergens. For example, if your Golden Retriever is allergic to pollen, keep your dog inside more often, especially when pollen counts are high. When your Golden Retriever does need to go outside, wipe it down with a wet cloth afterwards to remove the pollen from its fur and skin.Pay special attention to wiping off your Golden Retriever’s paws.Your dog could lick its paws or touch another part of its body with the paws and trigger an allergic reaction.
Reducing exposure can be effective if your vet identified the specific ‘culprit’ allergen. Without knowing the specific allergen, reducing exposure would be very difficult.;
, If your Golden Retriever is allergic to dust or dust mites, several avoidance strategies are available. For example, dust and vacuum your home frequently (at least once a week). In addition, wash your Golden Retriever’s bedding in hot water regularly. Changing your air filters regularly, according to product instructions, will also help keep dust out of the air in your home.Other strategies to reduce exposure to dust and dust mites are:Placing a plastic cover over your dog’s bed
Using the air conditioner when it’s hot outside
Keeping your Golden Retriever in non-carpeted rooms, such as the kitchen
Keeping your Golden Retriever out of recently vacuumed areas
Not giving your Golden Retriever stuffed toys to play with, since they could accumulate dust

, Mold is another common allergen associated with CAD. If your Golden Retriever is allergic to mold, consider using dehumidifiers, which reduce humidity in the air. Dehumidifiers are available at home supply stores. Also, avoid having houseplants, since the soil of potted plants can get moldy.Keeping your Golden Retriever out of the basement and avoiding dusty pet foods can also reduce mold exposure.If you do have house plants, put activated charcoal on the soil to prevent mold development.Look for activated charcoal at your local gardening store.
Clean your dehumidifiers according to the product’s instructions. Cleaning them will help them work more effectively.

Take your Rottweiler to the vet.,
X-ray the joints.,
Get your dog other types of scans.,
Get a sample of the joint fluid.",How to Diagnose Arthritis in Rottweilers2," If your dog shows signs of arthritis, take her to the vet. The vet will watch how the dog stands up from lying down, copes with stairs, and walks to get an idea of how mobile she is and which leg or legs are affected.


The vet will also feel the joints for heat and swelling, and then bend and extend each joint to see if it moves freely or movement is restricted., X-rays are common diagnostic tools for arthritis. However, in the early stages of osteoarthritis, which is before the joint swells and the bone is remodeled, it is possible to miss arthritis purely because the change hasn't happened yet.


X-rays can also help the vet troubleshoot for other causes of lameness, such as sprains, infection, fractures, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer.

, Depending on the clinic, your vet may suggest giving your dog a CT scan or an MRI. These methods are very expensive, however, and not available everywhere., If a joint is swollen, the vet may decide to tap the joint with a needle and syringe to draw off a small sample of joint fluid for analysis.


This can help eliminate joint infections, and confirm the swelling is down to inflammation."
"
Understand the genetic tendency.,
Buy your Rottweiler from a reputable breeder.,
Limit physical exertion when she’s young.,
Avoid letting your Rottweiler get overweight.,
Know where arthritis usually occurs.",How to Diagnose Arthritis in Rottweilers3," Arthritis is common in Rottweilers because of their genetic tendency to hip dysplasia, which causes poorly formed hips in young animals. The poor shape of the hip joint means the wear and tear is greater, leading to inflammation and arthritis.In addition, osteochondrosis dissecans (OCD) can lead to damaged joint surfaces in a young, growing dog, leading to premature arthritis.

, You can help decrease the chances of getting a dog with arthritis by buying a dog from a breeder who screens his breeding stock for hip dysplasia and can provide certification to prove the dogs have good hips., Another way to help prevent arthritis is to not overexert the puppy or make the puppy take part in exercise, such as agility, until she is old enough. This places stress on the joints. Avoid these activities until she is 18 months old, because hip dysplasia will have presented by this age.


This doesn’t mean you can’t play with her or she shouldn’t exercise. Just take it easy on her joints.

, Carrying extra weight places added strain on the joints and should be avoided. Thus it is best to keep the Rottweiler in slim body condition for a long and active life.

, Arthritis can affect any joint in the body. However, most often the shoulders, hips, elbows, knees, and ankles are affected."
"
Know the basic method.,
Choose your reward.,
Consider clicker training.,
Train one skill at a time and keep sessions short, simple and rewarding.,
Decide what you want your dog to know.",How to Train a Golden Retriever Puppy1," There are many different methods of training dogs, but the effective ones all boil to three things: rewarding behaviors you like; not rewarding behaviors you don’t like; and staying consistent.Rewarding – This is the easy and fun part. Rewards aren’t just for when you are actively training. If your goldie pees outside, you praise her. If she greets another dog in a friendly manner, tell her how great she is.
Not rewarding negative behavior – This requires a little more vigilance. If your dog is doing something you don’t like, think about why: usually it is because she is rewarded somehow. You need to consistently remove that reward. For instance, if she jumps all over you in excitement when she sees her leash, you will not want to put it on and take her for a walk, as that rewards the behavior. Instead, turn away or look to the sky until she calms down. Then put the leash on and walk her.
Be consistent – You and everyone else should respond the same way whatever your dog does. If you don’t feed her from the table, but your kid is busy offering your golden half his plate, you’re in trouble. Or if you tell your dog to get down when she jumps up sometimes and greet her enthusiastically others times, you are sending mixed messages that will confuse your dog.;
, Whenever you are training your dog for a specific behavior, you will need to have a reward on hand. Pick something your goldie really loves; the better the reward, the easier it will be to teach your dog.If your dog loves to play, you can try using her favorite toy and playing with her when she barks. Most people, however, will find that treats are the most effective way to teach a dog. The best treats will be ones your dog loves, and which are also easy to carry, easy to break into pieces, and healthy.Use a variety of treats so your dog doesn’t get bored.Try:String cheese sticks.
Cooked chicken.
Meat rolls (available at pet stores).
Broken-up dog biscuits or store-bought training treats.
Baby carrots or frozen green beans (for dogs on a diet).

, In clicker training, you use a sound (the clicker) to let your dog know when she has done something right. The clicker is very effective because it is a consistent, unique sound, different from your voice. However, you can also say “good” or “yes” as a signal if you don’t have a clicker.Load your clicker first. Get a treat in your hand. If your dog tries to get it, just close your hand. Click and offer it to your dog. Repeat a few minutes later. Then again. Continue until your dog comes immediately at the sound of the clicker and expects a treat., Effective training should be fun for you and your dog. To get the most out of it, follow these best practices:Keep it short. Training sessions should last no more than 15 minutes, and usually less for a puppy.
Train one part of one skill. For instance, if you are teaching sit and stay, start with sit. Reward all sitting, then add a command as your dog sits, then practice sitting on command. Next practice staying seated. Then train staying seated while you walk away. And finally move the training to a more distracting environment like a park. Breaking training down like this will make it much more effective.
Use simple words, not sentences. You need your commands to be simple and consistent: “sit” instead of “sit, Fido” or “sit down” or “would you please sit.” The more words you use, the more confused your dog will be.
Don’t go to fast or too long. If your dog is having a hard time with part of a skill, go back to something she knows. Keep the training positive. Don’t end with failure. Be sure to stop before your dog gets bored or frustrated.
Practice in real life. Don’t just train your dog during sessions. Practice “sit” or “stay” when out on walks. Do fist bumps at the park. Make training a part of life.
Be patient! It takes time to train a dog; indeed, it’s a process that never ends. But it’s worth it. A well-trained dog is a safe, happy dog that is a pleasure to own.

, All owners will want their golden retriever puppy to be house-trained as soon as possible, and most will want to leash train their puppy as well. Basic obedience training – sit, stay, come, down, and leave it – is also vital. The other tricks, skills, and behaviors that are desired will depend on the likes and dislikes of each owner and dog.


Golden’s love to fetch, and it is a great way to exercise them, so it’s a good skill for them to learn. But you may want to teach your dog to play tug of war or catch a Frisbee instead.
Tricks like “speak” and “shake” (or “fist bump”) are fun, but not necessary.
If you travel or board your dog frequently, you will want to be sure she is crate trained.
Depending on your dog’s temperament, you may have to train them not to beg, not to jump on you when you come home, or not to show aggressiveness towards other dogs (though this last is not typically a problem with golden retrievers).

"
Use a medicated, pet-specific shampoo.,
Bathe your Golden Retriever regularly.,
Apply a conditioner after the bath.",How to Treat Skin Allergies in Golden Retrievers2," Bathing your Golden Retriever is an important component of treating CAD, since it will remove allergens that may have settled on your dog’s fur. If your Golden Retriever has scratched its skin so much that it has become infected, a medicated shampoo will help treat those infected skin lesions. Medicated shampoo will contain either an antimicrobial or antifungal ingredient.Medicated shampoos often contain oatmeal or essential fatty acids to keep the skin from drying out.Purchase the medicated shampoo at your vet’s office.
Do not use a human shampoo to bathe your dog.Dog skin and human skin have different pH levels. Because of the pH differences, human shampoo could irritate your Golden Retriever’s skin.

, To help your Golden Retriever feel less itchy, bathe it either once a week or every other week.Even if your Golden Retriever feels really itchy, do not bathe it too frequently (more than once a week)—this could strip its skin of essential oils, causing dry skin. If your Golden Retriever still seems uncomfortably itchy with weekly or bi-weekly bathing, talk with your vet about how often you should bathe your dog.


Consider rinsing or wiping down your Golden Retriever each day.This would remove the allergens in between baths. However, this may not be practical if you have a busy schedule.
You could also use a topical anti-inflammatory product between baths on the itchy spots.This product, which would contain a steroid like hydrocortisone, would be available at your vet’s office.
If your Golden Retriever has skin lesions, wash very gently around those areas, since they may be very sensitive to the touch.

, When you finish bathing your Golden Retriever, apply a leave-in conditioner to the skin and coat. This conditioner will not only soothe the skin, but also serve as a barrier to keep allergens from contacting the skin.Apply the conditioner according to the product label instructions.


Use a pet-safe conditioner.

"
"
Consult with your vet about treatment with antihistamines.,
Administer the antihistamine as prescribed.,
Try several antihistamines.",How to Treat Skin Allergies in Golden Retrievers3," Antihistamines are commonly used to treat allergies in dogs. They work by blocking the release of histamine from mast cells (cells involved in allergic reactions). Antihistamines work best in dogs with seasonal or mild skin allergies. If this describes your Golden Retriever’s CAD, then your vet will probably prescribe an antihistamine.Antihistamines are effective in about 30% of dogs with CAD.Antihistamines are inexpensive and have very few side effects., Antihistamines work best when given consistently, not just as needed. If you give your Golden Retriever the antihistamine after an allergic reaction has started, then it’s already too late—the antihistamine needs to be in your dog’s system before the mast cells have a chance to release histamine.Your vet will probably want you to give your Golden Retriever an antihistamine two to three times daily.Antihistamines for dogs are given by mouth.

, Antihistamines do not work the same in every dog. For this reason, your vet may recommend trying up to three antihistamines before moving on to a different type of therapy. Examples of dog-safe antihistamines are Benadryl, Zyrtec, and Claritin.These are human, over-the-counter antihistamines, but their dosages can be adjusted to be effective in dogs.


Note that the active medication in Benadryl can vary depending on the country. Always check with a vet to make sure the key component of any antihistamine is safe.
Try each antihistamine for 10 – 14 days.Your Golden Retriever may need a higher dose of antihistamine than a human would need. Before using these over-the-counter antihistamines, ask your vet what dosage of antihistamine your dog will need.With each antihistamine, contact your vet to let them know if your Golden Retriever’s symptoms are getting any better.
Your Golden Retriever may still be itchy with antihistamine therapy. However, the itchiness will probably be less than what it was before."
"
Discuss steroid treatment with your vet.,
Follow treatment instructions.,
Monitor your Golden Retriever for side effects.,
Use other skin allergy therapies with steroids.",How to Treat Skin Allergies in Golden Retrievers4," Steroids are anti-inflammatory. By decreasing inflammation, steroids help a dog with CAD feel less itchy. However, steroids have serious long-term side effects, including increased drinking and urinating, liver enlargement, high blood pressure, and a weakened immune system.Because CAD requires lifelong therapy, you and your vet will need to discuss the safest way to use steroids to treat your Golden Retriever’s CAD.


Even though steroids rapidly reduce itching and inflammation, your vet’s goal may be to limit or even eliminate the use of steroids for your Golden Retriever.Prednisone is a type of steroid used to treat CAD., Steroids can be given as short-term relief for flare-ups (temporary episodes of itchiness).They can also be given for the duration of an allergy season, as long as the season is short (a few months or less).As a third option, steroids can be given as long term, low-dose therapy. Your vet will determine which type of steroid therapy your Golden Retriever will need.


If your Golden Retriever needs long term steroid therapy, your vet may prescribe a low dosage to be given every other day.Your vet would start with an initial dosage, then gradually decrease that dosage as your Golden Retriever’s symptoms improve.
Do not make changes to the steroid dosage on your own. This could make treatment more challenging.

, If your Golden Retriever is on long term steroid therapy, monitoring for side effects is very important. In addition to observing your dog at home, your vet will want to see your dog regularly to analyze blood and urine samples.For example, because steroids can cause liver enlargement, your vet will want to look for increased levels of liver enzymes in your dog’s blood.


If you notice any side effects (e.g., drinking and urinating more often, diarrhea, increased panting) at home, contact your vet right away. You do not have to wait until your regularly scheduled appointment to have your Golden Retriever examined.

, In addition to steroids, your vet may prescribe other medications, such as antihistamines, with the goal of limiting or eliminating steroid use.Follow prescription instructions for these other medications. Your vet will determine if the other medications are working well enough to start phasing out the steroids from the treatment plan.

Discuss cyclosporine treatment with your vet.,
Administer cyclosporine as prescribed.,
Monitor your Golden Retriever for side effects.,
Wait for a response to therapy.,
Schedule follow-up visits with your vet.",How to Treat Skin Allergies in Golden Retrievers5," Your vet may recommend a drug called cyclosporine, which is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Unlike steroids, long term cyclosporine therapy is generally well tolerated by dogs.However, cyclosporine is expensive, especially for large breed dogs.Fortunately, as a dog starts to respond to cyclosporine therapy, the required dosage would decrease. Therefore, the cost of cyclosporine therapy would decrease over time.Talk with your vet if you are concerned about the overall cost of cyclosporine.
Atopica® is the brand name for cyclosporine that is used in dogs.

, Cyclosporine is an oral drug. Initially, it is usually given daily for 4‒6 weeks. Then, the dosage is gradually decreased to the lowest effective dose.Give the cyclosporine on an empty stomach., Cyclosporine can cause several side effects, including vomiting and diarrhea. Side effects usually occur within the first two weeks of therapy. Contact your vet if you observe these side effects. Your vet may recommend stopping the cyclosporine for a few days, then restarting it by giving it with a small amount of food. If there’s no diarrhea and vomiting after a few days, go back to giving cyclosporine on an empty stomach.Infections and thickening of the gums are rare side effects of cyclosporine., Unlike the rapid treatment response with steroids, it may take 6‒8 weeks before your Golden Retriever responds to cyclosporine therapy. Even if you become impatient with waiting for a treatment response, do not change the cyclosporine dosage on your own—this could lead to treatment failure, which could make your Golden Retriever feel even itchier., Because cyclosporine decreases the immune response, your Golden Retriever’s immune system function may go down. Your vet will want to check your Golden Retriever’s white blood cell count regularly to assess the health of its immune system.If the white blood cell counts are low, your vet may need to adjust the cyclosporine dosage.


These follow-up visits will also allow your vet to determine how well your Golden Retriever is responding to therapy.

Discuss treatment options with the vet.,
Ask your dog's breeder if his parents had OCD.,
Feed your dog large breed growth food.,
Make sure your dog maintains a healthy weight and does not do any intense exercise.",How to Diagnose Osteochondrosis Dissecans in Rottweilers," One of the key signs of OCD is a persistent limp or lameness in your dog. This is a common symptom in young dogs who have OCD, who may have difficulty putting some or any weight on one leg.The severity of the limp depends on how much damage develops on your dog’s joint lining. Your dog may have a mild limp, where he leans to one side and puts less weight on one leg. Or, he may have a severe limp, where he puts little to no weight on one leg. He may start with a mild limp and over weeks or months, his condition will get worse until he can no longer put any weight on his leg.;
, If your dog has OCD, he may take shorter strides with the affected leg. This is due to putting less weight on one leg.You can also look at your dog when he stands still. He may place weight on his healthy leg and put little to no weight on his affected leg.

, Your dog’s affected leg will likely have less muscle mass than his healthy leg, as he is not working it as hard due to pain or discomfort. The affected leg will likely be less muscular and may also appear swollen.You can use your hands to touch your dog’s legs. Note if one of his legs feels very warm to the touch, swollen, and less muscular than his other legs. These could all be signs that his leg has OCD.

, First, the vet will do a physical exam of your Rottweiler to confirm the affected leg and locate where the joint is painful for your dog. Your vet may manipulate your dog’s joints in isolation to check that your dog’s hock, or ankle, is the sore area, not his hip, knee, or toes. This will allow her to better confirm your dog has OCD in his hock., The vet may then sedate or anesthetize your Rottweiler so she can take X-rays of your dog’s hock and any other areas that may be sore. Usually, two views are taken of your dog’s hock in the X-rays. One view is taken from front to back (anterior-posterior) and one view is taken side to side (lateral).Doing two views in the x-rays will help the vet rule out other conditions such as a fracture, an infection, and cancer. However, X-rays are not a foolproof way to detect OCD in your dog’s hock. In the early stages of the condition, the only clear evidence of OCD is a flap of cartilage on your dog’s hock or a chip off the cartilage. It may be difficult to spot these small issues on an X-ray.

, If the X-rays are inconclusive, the vet may recommend more advanced forms of imaging, such as a CT scan. The CT scan will provide a more detailed image of the structure of your dog’s bone and cartilage. It can also better detect hairline fractures and cartilage damage., The vet may also try to get a better read on your dog’s joint by using an endoscope. An endoscope is a small camera that can be fitted into your dog’s joint. The vet can then get a real-time view of the surface of the joint and make a clear diagnosis.This procedure also allows the vet to remove any troublesome cartilage chips floating in your dog’s joint or trim back a flap in your dog’s joint. Thus, the vet has the ability to actually treat the problem during the diagnosis.
After the surgery, your dog should rest for two to four weeks and avoid doing anything active. Too much activity post surgery can cause a pocket of fluid to build up at the incision site. The vet should prescribe pain medication for your dog and suggest a post-surgery diet so he does not gain too much weight after the surgery. Most Rottweilers recovery from the surgery within eight to twelve weeks and can function normally., Even if the vet treats the problem during the endoscope, she may recommend further treatment to prevent your Rottweiler from developing secondary arthritis later in life. This could include keep your Rottweiler slim through a healthy, restricted diet and giving your dog joint supplements like chondroitin and glucosamine.The vet may also suggest surgery to remove any damage cartilage in your dog’s joint. This can prevent his OCD from getting worse.

, Rottweilers as a breed have a predisposition to developing OCD in their hock joints. You should discuss the health of your dog’s parents with the breeder before you buy him as a puppy. Often, a puppy will inherit genes from his parents, and parents with poor cartilage health can pass that on to their offspring.Dogs diagnosed with OCD should not be used to bred, as they will likely pass on the condition to their offspring. However, there is no genetic screening test available yet for OCD in Rottweilers.
If you considering buying a Rottweiler from a breeder, you should set up an in person meeting with the breeder and the Rottweiler. You should watch how the Rottweiler walks and note any limping or unevenness in his gait, as these can be symptoms of OCD.

, Another risk factor is a Rottweiler puppy who grows too quickly. Fast growth forces your dog’s bones to grow too quickly and can put stress on your dog’s joints. Dogs that will weigh more than 25kg as adults, such as Rottweiler puppies, should be feed large breed growth food.This type of food contains a sufficient amount of calcium for a larger dog, which will not force his bones to grow too fast. Regular growth food can provide too much calcium, which may then force your dog’s bones to grow too rapidly.

, Excess weight or too much weight can lead to health issues in your dog and put stress on your dog’s joints. This can then lead to the development of OCD in your dog’s joint, especially if he is genetically predisposed to the condition.Though larger dogs like Rottweilers should get enough exercise every day, you should avoid doing intense exercise or excessive exercise with your Rottweiler. Too much exercise can put strain on your dog’s joints and force him to do awkward movements that can cause damage to the joint lining your dog’s joints. This could then increase his risk of developing OCD.

Decide what you will teach your puppy.,
Use the lure method to teach “sit”.,
Use the capture method to teach sit.",How to Train a Golden Retriever Puppy2," Obedience training consists of teaching your dog to do things in response to your verbal commands or hand signals. Basic commands like “sit”, “come”, “leave it”, and “stay” are important to help you manage your dog and ensure her safety, but there are many other commands you can teach, like “shake”, “roll over”, “jump” or “speak”. Most of these skills are taught with the same basic reward-based methods – capturing or luring – which will be demonstrated here with “sit”.

, Be sure to break up the training described here into multiple short sessions carried out over several days.


With a treat in hand, hold your hand out so your puppy can smell it, then lift your hand up and back over her head. As her eyes follow you and her head goes up, your golden puppy will automatically sit. As soon as she does, say “yes” or click and give the treat. Do this until she is easily lured into sitting.
Now try the same thing, but with no treat in your hand. Say “sit” and move your hand back. Give her the treat as soon as she sits.
When your golden has mastered sitting for your empty hand, back away, and use the same hand motion at a distance while saying “sit”.
Finally, say “sit” without the hand motion, and reward your dog when she does so.

, Get some treats. Ignore you puppy, but watch her closely. As soon as she sits, say “sit” and toss a treat. She will probably try all sorts of things to get another treat. Wait for her to sit again, then say “sit” and toss a treat. Your dog will quickly learn to link sitting, the word “sit” and treats.

Know when to house train your golden retriever puppy.,
Be positive and consistent.,
Feed your puppy on a regular schedule.,
Take your puppy outside frequently on a regular schedule.,
Keep a close eye on your puppy to prevent accidents.,
Confine your golden retriever puppy when you can’t watch her.,
Reward your puppy when she pees or poops outside.,
Stay calm if you catch your puppy in the middle of an accident.",How to Train a Golden Retriever Puppy3," Start house training the moment you bring the puppy home. After the journey, take pup out to your chosen toilet spot and let her sniff around. If she happens to pee or poop, give her a reward. Regularly take the pup to the toilet spot (every 20 minutes when possible) and when she happens to toilet give her lots of praise. Times when she is most likely to toilet are immediately after eating, and 20 minutes after eating. Pop her outside on both occasions and this increases your chances of her pooping in the toilet spot.
This early stage is all about happy coincidences and rewarding them. Don't worry if she doesn't ""get it"" at first, but never ever punish her for going indoors.

, Punishing your dog for peeing or pooping in the house will only scare her and make it harder for her to learn. Consistency is the best way to train your dog.

, Remove the food between meals. Regular feedings will lead to regular times when your dog needs to eliminate., A consistent schedule is the best way to avoid accidents. Very young puppies should be taken out every hour, as well as shortly after meals and naps. All puppies should be taken out first thing in the morning, just before you go to bed, and before they are confined or left alone.A puppy can usually hold her pee for the same number of hours as her age in months during the day.
Puppies can hold their pee longer at night. A 4 month old puppy should be able to make it through the night

, You don’t want your puppy to get in the habit of eliminating in the house, so whenever she is not confined, watch her closely. Pacing, whining, circling, sniffing, and leaving the room are all signs that your puppy needs to pee or poop. Get her outside as quickly as possible., Use a crate or a small room with the door closed or blocked off by a baby gate. As your puppy grows, you can gradually increase the size of the area, eventually letting her use multiple rooms. Especially when first increasing the size of the space, it’s a good idea to introduce your golden to the space just after she has eliminated outside., During house training, you should always go outside with your puppy. Take her to the same place each time, so the smells will encourage her to go. Rewards peeing or pooping outside with praise, treats, or play. , You don’t want to scare your puppy, and you definitely don’t want to rub her face in the mess. Clap sharply in order to startle her; this will usually cause her to stop. Then quickly run with her outside, encouraging her to follow you. If your golden finishes peeing or pooping outside, give a reward. If she has nothing left, don’t worry about it."

Decide how trained you need your dog to be.,
Get the right equipment.,
Make every walk into a training session.,
Exercise your dog before leash training sessions.,
Have treats on hand.,
Walk quickly.,
Choose your method.",How to Train a Golden Retriever Puppy4," It takes discipline, consistency, and time to teach you dog to walk at your side, never tugging on the leash or taking off to chase squirrels. But if that’s what you’re after, then you can do it. On the other hand, you may not mind if your dog walks ahead of you, so long as she doesn’t tug too hard on the lease. In this case, a no-pull harness or head halter might do the trick without any extra training. Knowing what you are aiming for – and being on the same page with anyone else who walks the dog – is key.

, You’ll want a four to six foot, fixed length leash. Extendable leashes and very long ones will make training more difficult. For a collar, use: a regular buckle or snap collar; a slip collar; a head halter; or a no-pull harness.Do not use a choke collar, unless training with a professional trainer.
Never use a pinch or prong collar, unless training with a professional trainer.

, Consistency is the key, so until your dog can walk without pulling, every walk, no matter who gives it, is a training session. Keep them short and fun. Going on a long walk with a dog who is not yet trained will only frustrate both of you., This is important for two reasons: 1) until your puppy is trained, your walks will be too short to fully exercise her; and 2) dogs with lots of energy are more likely to pull. Play fetch or tug, or let your dog romp with other dogs at the park before your leash training sessions., You’ll need lots of them to train your dog. For walks, soft ones like cheese, cooked hot dogs, jerky, or chicken are best, since they can be eaten quickly while your dog is walking., Moving fast makes you more interesting to your dog, and she will be less likely to stop repeatedly if she’s moving fast. It will also be easier to teach your dog not to pull if you’re going a bit closer to her natural pace.

, There are four main methods to teach your dog not to pull. Some work better with some dogs than others. If you choose a method and appear to be making no progress after several weeks, pick another one.Stop and go – When your dog reaches the end of the lease, stop. Wait until she puts slack in the leash, then call her to you and ask her to sit. When she does, say “yes” and give her a treat. Do this every time your dog reaches the end of the leash. Also give your dog treats regularly whenever she looks at you or walks close to you. You want her to associate walking near you with treats, and tugging with the walk stopping. If she tugs to smell something, stop as usual, but instead of giving her a treat after she sits, let her explore the scent she was going for as her reward.
Lure and reward – Fill your left hand with treats, hold it in front of your golden retriever puppy’s nose, say “let’s walk”, and start walking. Give a treat every few seconds. If she pulls, stop and call her back to you, then reward her. Don’t go too far – these walks take lots of treats and bending over. After a week, stop luring. Say “let’s walk” and walk with your left hand held normally. Give a treat every other step. In the coming walks, gradually increase the number of steps between treats: 2, 5, 10, 20. Eventually, you should be able to walk your dog with only occasional treats.
About face – This option is mainly for dogs that struggle with the first two methods. When your dog is nearing the end of the leash, say “easy.” If she slows, say “yes” and reward her with a treat. If she keeps going to the end, turn abruptly and head the other way, letting the leash check your dog. Praise your dog as she hurries to catch up, and when she reaches you, turn and resume walking in the original direction. Do this every time your dog pulls. When your dog is walking near you or at your side, treat her regularly.

This method should work quickly. If pulling does not decrease after several sessions, stop.
Do not use this method with a head halter or pinch collar, as it may injure your dog.


Collar correction - This option is mainly for dogs that struggle with the first two methods. When your dog is nearing the end of the leash, say “easy.” If she slows, say “yes” and reward her with a treat. If she keeps going to the end, jerk abruptly on the leash. It may take several jerks to get your dog to slow down. Be sure to reward your dog regularly when she is walking near you with a slack leash.

Be aware that pulling too hard can hurt your dog’s neck or throat.
This method should reduce pulling in a couple of days. If it does not, you need to stop and try something else.

Be more aware if your dog has risk factors.",How to Treat Hypothyroidism in Golden Retrievers," A diagnosis is made by testing the levels of thyroid hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone in your dog's blood. Basically, the vet is testing to see if the thyroid, and the chemicals that tell the thyroid to go to work, are functioning correctly.Low levels of thyroid hormone in itself are unreliable for identifying hypothyroidism. The thyroid may be suppressed temporarily because of ill health caused by something else. Unless absolutely essential, it is not a good idea to start thyroid hormone supplements based solely on the levels of thyroid hormone.
Comparing the level of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) to the amount of thyroid hormone in the blood stream is a much more reliable test. If the body needs more thyroid hormone, then levels of TSH should be raised to stimulate the thyroid to make more hormone. However, if there is a lot of TSH and the thyroid levels remain low, then there is probably a problem producing the thyroid hormone.;
, Hypothyroidism is relatively simple to correct, as the golden retriever merely needs to be given extra thyroid hormone in tablet form. Most thyroid tablets are given twice a day, so that a steady level remains in the blood stream.


The tablets contain thyroxine (levothyroxine), of which Soloxine is the brand name product. There are however generic varieties available, which have the advantage of being cheaper, whilst there is a slight question mark that they are not as effective as Soloxine because they are not so well absorbed by the body., There is some monitoring needed, requiring repeat blood samples, to measure thyroid levels over time. This is to check the levels have risen but are not too high. The blood test should be taken 4 - 6 hours after a pill is administered, and once stable, six-monthly checks are advised.


Giving too much thyroid hormone can potentially over stimulate the metabolism and cause a racing heart, high blood pressure, and damage to the liver and kidneys.
Signs of overdose of thyroid include increased thirst and appetite, and restlessness.If you suspect your dog is on the wrong dose, contact your vet immediately.

, Once started, the treatment is given for life. The thyroid does not recover from hypothyroidism, so your dog will need to take thyroid pills for the rest of its life.


It is recommended that dogs diagnosed with hypothyroidism should not be bred from, because of the likely genetic link., Optimize your golden's diet in order to reverse the weight gain that usually occurs with hypothyroidism. Discuss the best diet for your dog with your veterinarian, as the vet should understand the dietary requirements that will allow your golden to heal and to lose excess weight.


In addition to dietary changes, begin an exercise routine. The is a key component of any weight loss plan. Your dog may still be exhausted and lethargic from its illness, so ramp up its exercise routine gradually., Once your dog is medicated, some of the symptoms, such as sluggishness, should go away quickly. Keep an eye on your dog and make sure it is progressively getting better.From the start of therapy, it will take around 4 - 6 weeks for the blood levels to stabilize and the signs of hypothyroidism to reverse.Of the symptoms of hypothyroidism, the coat change take the longest to resolve.

, Since thyroid hormone governs cellular metabolism, a lack of thyroid leads to a general slowly of the body and it's functions. For example, mental dullness is a common sign, and affects around 70% of those with hypothyroidism., Dogs with hypothyroidism tend to gain weight, as their metabolism is affected by a lack of thyroid hormone. This weight gain will be out of proportion to the amount of food they consume., Golden retrievers with hypothyroidism with have coats that are often poor quality and dull. They also tend to molt heavily.Hair loss usually occurs on the body but does not occur on the head or legs.
This hair loss is not usually accompanied by redness or itching.
Some dogs develop a ""rat's tail"" where the hair on the tail falls out, leaving a bald tail.

, Some dogs are described a having a tragic facial expression, as their features seem to thicken and become heavier looking. These dogs feel the cold, and are often found next to a heater. They are often also depressed and hesitant to interact.They are also reluctant to exercise, and may be anemic. They may also have a slow heart rate.

, For example, medium-sized to large dogs are more likely to suffer hypothyroidism that small or toy breeds. The golden retriever is predisposed, along with the Doberman, miniature Schnauzer, cocker spaniel, Irish setter, Dachshund, and Airedale terrier.Dogs with parents who had hypothyroidism are more likely to get the disease. If this is the case for your dog, just be aware of the potential problem and keep an eye out for signs it is developing.

Apply dry shampoo to groom your Golden Retriever if you don't want to give it a bath.,
Apply flea and tick preventative to complete your Golden Retriever's grooming ritual.",How to Groom a Golden Retriever," Pay close attention to each area, spending extra time on parts of your Golden Retriever's body where the fur is thick or matted.


To keep your Golden Retriever's coat in good shape, brush it head to toe at least once a week, if not every day. This will help avoid matting and will also help decrease the amount of fur your dog sheds in your home.;
, If you are brushing your dog every week, the mats that develop should be minimal. In order to remove mats, cut them out with a sharp pair of scissors, being careful not to cut your dog in the process.


Before cutting out a mat, you should try to brush it out. Hold the fur above the mat close to the dog's skin in order to protect the dog from excessive pulling. Brush or comb the fur out gently, starting at the very tip of the mat and working your way in towards the skin.

, There is some debate whether you should do this before or after you trim its coat. If your Golden Retriever is really dirty and smelly, go ahead and bathe it before you groom it. If your pup has been bathed recently, you can probably skip the bath or wait until after you groom the dog in order to get any excess fur off at the end.


Lather the shampoo all over your dog's body, rinse thoroughly and rub dry with a large towel.If you want a show-worthy coat, it may be necessary to blow dry the pup's fur. Just remember to keep the heat low and move in the direction of the fur's growth.While many Golden Retriever owners only bathe their pups when the dog is especially dirty, some choose to bathe them on a regular schedule, such as once every two months. The choice is yours.

, This will straighten out the coat and give you a good starting point for grooming. You might consider using an undercoat comb to get as much undercoat out as possible before you start to thin it with thinning shears.

, Golden Retrievers have a double coat, consisting of an undercoat and an overcoat. The combination coat is designed to keep the dog at a comfortable temperature in any season.It traps cool air between the coats on a hot day and traps warm air between coats on a cold day. If you were to trim the entire coat, it would inhibit this natural heating and cooling system.


You should not need to use clippers to trim a Golden Retriever.A pair of scissors and a pair of thinning shears should be enough to do the necessary fur trimming.

, The edges usually get a lot of fuzzy hair growth, so that needs to be cleanly trimmed away with scissors. Next, trim in between your Golden Retriever's toes. Take your comb and brush up the hair between its toes. Then trim it away at the level of the top of the pup's feet. Then comb it all back down. It should now be above the level of the dog's pads. The fur on your dog's feet should be short, around a 1/2 inch long, and should lay down smooth against the surface of the foot.
Also inspect the Golden Retriever's pads while you are focusing on their feet. Apply Vaseline if you find any cracked pads and decide whether your pup needs its nails trimmed.

, Trim the fur on the back of the dog's legs with your thinning shears. You don't need to remove all the longer fur that grows near their rear end, but you want the coat to look balance and symmetrical. Focus your attention on trimming off fuzzy and unkempt fur.


The fur on the back of the legs will be longer than the fur on the front of the legs. The hair on the back of the legs should be a few inches long, flaring out a bit behind the dog, while the fur on the front will lay flat against the dog.

, Begin by using your thinning shears around the dog's shoulders if a ridge of hair has formed there. Then move your attention to the front of the dog, thinning the hair on its chest until it lies flat.


The length of your dog's fur will vary. A Golden Retriever doesn't have a short, tight coat, but instead has some length to it. When trimming your dog's coat, focus more on trimming fuzzy and unkempt fur, instead of trimming to a specific length.
If you are unsure if you have removed enough hair, comb the coat out and see if the coat is lying flat. The goal is to have a nice flat coat that is balanced and symmetrical.
As you trim, move the thinning shears with the direction of the growth.
Using the thinning shears to trim the neck and chest will give the dog a more natural look.

, Thin the fur around the front and back of the ears. This will be important to keeping your dog's ears healthy. Then trim the fur on the ears, taking stray hairs off the top of them with the thinning shears., Don't make the tail fur too short. You just want to trim the length by tapering it from the base to the tip, using thinning shears to make it look natural., Golden Retriever grooming is not complete without paying close attention to these areas. You can use mineral oil and cotton balls for these specifics of dog grooming, being careful not to get it directly in your dog's eyes.

, This can be a delicate operation, as your dog needs to keep its feet still in order to avoid injury. Remember to take your time, use a good pair of dog nail trimmers, and avoid cutting above the quick, the live part of the nail.The length of your dog's trimmed nails will vary, depending on the dog. The goal it to cut your dog's nails below the quick but to take some length off of them. Nails that are too long can break, possibly causing infection or an irregular gait.Train your dog to associate good things with its feet being handled by giving it a treat whenever you trim its nails., Work the powder into his or her skin, and leave it on for at least 20 minutes. After the 20 minutes have elapsed, brush your dog's fur to remove any excess powder.

, If you are grooming your Golden Retriever monthly, then this is a great time to remember to apply flea and tick preventative. Keeping your dog's coat free of fleas will not only help the dog's healthy but will also keep its coat free of dander and flea dust.

Ask your vet how immunotherapy works.,
Have your vet perform the immunotherapy injections.,
Wait for a treatment response.",How to Treat Skin Allergies in Golden Retrievers6," Immunotherapy, also called Allergen Specific Immunotherapy (ASIT), is usually the best choice for treating CAD. It can help your Golden Retriever achieve remission (no visible signs of CAD) without the use of other medications (e.g., steroids, antihistamines). ASIT works by gradually desensitizing your dog’s immune system to the allergens causing the CAD.The immunotherapy medicine, commonly given by injection, contains small amounts of the specific allergens to which your Golden Retriever is allergic.By exposing your Golden Retriever to small, measured amounts of the allergens (rather than a large, uncontrolled amount in the environment), your dog’s immune system would slowly become more tolerant of the allergens over time, therefore lessening the allergic reaction.Results of the skin tests your vet performed to diagnose CAD would indicate the specific allergens.
Immunotherapy is most helpful for dogs that have skin allergies for longer than two to three months at a time and have not responded well to other skin allergy medications. It is a lifelong treatment., Immunotherapy injections are usually given about once every one to four weeks.Your vet will let you know how often your Golden Retriever will need the injections. It may help to schedule several appointments at one time to make sure your dog receives stays on schedule with the treatment.


At the beginning of immunotherapy, your vet will increase the dosage of allergens until a maintenance dosage is reached. Your vet will determine the maintenance dosage and keep your Golden Retriever at this dosage level. Your vet may change the frequency of injections during the course of therapy., This may be the hardest part of immunotherapy, since it may take anywhere from a few months to a full year before a dog responds to this type of therapy. Because your Golden Retriever will not respond to immunotherapy very quickly, your vet will recommend treating your dog with other skin allergy medications during the course of immunotherapy.Before starting immunotherapy, your vet will probably ask that you commit to this treatment for at least 1 year to see if it will work.Approximately 60 – 75% of dogs on immunotherapy will experience a 50% improvement in symptoms. This amount of improvement could mean that a dog does not need to be on other skin allergy medications."

Close the door.,
Move further away.,
Leave the room.,
Crate your dog when you are away.,
Have your dog sleep in the crate overnight.,
Be patient!",How to Train a Golden Retriever Puppy5," There are a variety of reasons to crate train your dog. Use your crate:To keep your puppy safe when you cannot watch her.
To keep your belongings safe when you cannot watch your puppy.
When your puppy is home alone.
To give your puppy a place to calm down.
When traveling.
To keep your puppy away from children or other dogs.
To aid in house training and other behavioral training.

, Never use your crate to punish your dog. And once your dog is no longer a puppy and can be trusted not to destroy the house, do not crate your dog when you are away. Save the crate for special times – i.e. guests in the house – and travel. For the most part, your dog should enter her crate voluntarily., The type of crate you use is up to personal preference, though many find that wire crates are the most durable and comfortable long-term solutions for dogs (as well as being used at most kennels where you might board your dog). The most important thing is that you get the right size crate. If it is too small, your dog will not be comfortable. If it is too large, it will provide the den-like space dogs crave.To save money, buy a crate to use for your dog when she grows up, and use a divider to make it the appropriate size for her as a puppy.
Your dog should be able to stand in the crate without hitting her head, to turn around comfortably, and to lie on their side with their paws stretched out.
For a typical adult golden, a 42” crate should suffice. Also buy a divider if purchasing the crate for your puppy.

, Your dog should enjoy her crate. It should provide a comfortable place for her to relax, so much so that she should choose to spend time there. Make sure to:Put the crate in a room where you spend lots of time, so your puppy does not feel abandoned.
Keep it a comfortable temperature: out of direct sunlight and far from fireplaces and radiators.
Place soft bedding inside.
Place chew toys inside to give your dog something to do.
Cover your wire crate with a towel or crate cover. This will give it more of the den-like feel your dog craves.

, Before crate training, you’ll want to teach your dog that the crate is magical place of wonder that produces things she loves. If you do it well, crate training will be much easier.Assemble your crate without your dog seeing it, prop the door open, and place treats around the entrance, just inside, and at the back. Throw some new dog toys in, too.
Let your dog explore the crate on her own. Don’t bring attention to it. Don’t say anything if she goes inside. Let her go at her own speed.
Every hour or so put more treats in the crate when your dog is not looking. Soon, they’ll be going into the crate on their own to check for treats. (Be sure to subtract all these treats from their daily food allowance.)
Also start feeding your dog in the crate. At first, put the bowl just inside so they only have to poke their head in. After 2 or 3 successful feedings, move it to the middle, then all the way back.

, Show your dog a treat and toss it in the crate. As they enter use your chosen command, such as “Crate.” When your dog enters, praise her and give another treat. Move away and wait for her to leave the crate. As she does so, use your exit cue word – “Out!” Praise but do not give a treat; you want treats to be associated with the magical crate.Do this 10 times, take a break of a few minutes, and do it 10 more times. Always use your cue words.
Repeat the whole ritual several times a day until your dog is happily entering the crate to fetch treats. This part of the training shouldn’t take long.

, After tossing a treat in once or twice to warm your dog up, use your command word without a treat. If she enters, praise profusely and give a treat or two. Also praise her when she leaves.Do this 10 times, take a break, and do it 10 more times.
Repeat this training several times a day for two or three days, until your dog is entering and leaving the crate on command.
If your golden puppy struggles with this step, go back to the previous one.

, Ask your puppy to enter the crate and sit. Slowly close the door. If you have to bang it shut before your dog escapes, then she is not ready for this step. When the door is closed, praise and give treats, then open the door and let her leave.Practice in sets of 10, with a break, then another set of ten.
Gradually lengthen the time they must sit in the crate before you let them out. Do sessions of training where they wait ten seconds, then 30, 45, and a minute., When your dog can comfortably stay in the crate for a minute, you will want to start moving away while she is in the crate.


In the first session, move only a few feet away before you come back. Move to different areas of the room and keep looking at your dog.
Next, try training sessions where you move around the room without paying attention to your puppy.
Add moments when you step out of the room briefly and return.
Finally, leave the room.

, At first, stay out for only five minutes. Gradually increase the time you are gone to 30 minutes.If your dog grows overly anxious while you are gone, return and let her out. Go back to the previous step or reduce the time you are leaving her.
Always remove your puppies leash and collar before putting her in the crate, as they are choking hazards., When your dog can stay comfortably in her crate for 30 minutes, it’s time to start putting her in the crate when you leave. For a puppy, these will need to be shorter trips, as a puppy cannot be expected to go more than 3 hours or so without urinating.Even when your dog is grown, you should not crate her during the day for more than 4 hours. She needs to be able to get up and stretch her legs.Exercise your dog and give her a chewy or toy before you go.
Vary the time you put your dog in the crate. Sometimes do it ten minutes before you go. Sometimes five. Sometimes right before you head out the door. You don’t want the crate to become a signal of abandonment.
Don’t make a fuss when you leave. Praise your dog for entering her crate, then go.

, Now that your puppy is comfortable in her crate, she can sleep there overnight, but be sure you can hear her. Puppies often need to pee in the middle of the night., Each dog is unique when it comes to crate training. Some goldens can be trained in a week or less. More timid dogs or those with bad previous experiences may take several weeks. Don’t push your dog too fast. Make sure they are comfortable with each step before moving to the next one."

Start with good habits.,
Use two toys to teach your dog to bring the toy back.,
Attach a line to the toy if using two toys doesn’t work.When your dog picks it up, shake the line and run away to encourage him to follow you.,
Use treats to get your dog to drop.,
Walk away to teach your dog to drop closer to you.,
Use “sit” and “stay” to keep your dog from picking the toy up when you reach for it.",How to Train a Golden Retriever Puppy6," Golden retrievers love to fetch, and it is a great way to exercise them. You probably won’t need any help getting your puppy to chase a ball or toy. But be sure to instill good habits early on to make sure they learn how to bring the toy back and drop it near you.

, Throw one, and when your dog picks it up, show the other toy and throw it the other way. While he is chasing it, pick up the first toy.Do this until he is accustomed to fetching and then running towards you.
Eventually, you can call your dog without showing the second toy. If he comes, say drop it and show the second toy.
When your dog will drop on command, you can eliminate the second toy.

,


If he follows give a treat.
If your dog still runs away, reel him in with the rope. Praise and reward when close.
Don’t always throw the toy right away. Let your dog chew on it sometimes after returning. You don’t want him to think he will lose it every time he returns.
After a few weeks, your dog should stop trying to escape with the toy.

, Say “drop it” and put a treat right in front of your dog’s nose. This will get even the most stubborn dogs to give up the toy.If your dog still won’t drop, try a more irresistible treat, like bits of bacon or cheese.
Eventually you will not need the treat, but still give one every so often.

, Just before your dog drops the toy, say “bring it” and move away. When he reaches the place you were standing, say “drop it” and walk back to him to pick up the toy. It may take a few weeks before your dog learns to bring the toy to you., Tell your dog to sit and stay when he drops the toy. If your dog tries to grab it when you bend down, immediately say “no” or “uh, uh” and stand up. Eventually, your dog will figure out that if he wants to keep playing, he will have to sit and stay while you pick up the toy.When he does hold the stay, remember to say “okay” to release him before you throw the toy again.

Figure out why your dog is barking.,
Give a command.,
Stand in front of your dog.,
Grab his muzzle.,
Ignore your dog.,
Reward your dog.,
Teach the quiet command.,
Play with your golden retriever.,
Stay calm around your dog.,
Be patient.,
Talk your vet.",How to Make a Golden Retriever Stop Barking," Golden retrievers, like any other dog, communicate verbally. Of course, they can’t talk, so instead, they bark. There are many types of barking, which are attempts to communicate different ideas and feelings. Understanding what your dog is trying to tell you is the first step to stopping it.Listen to the pitch, frequency, and duration of his barking. Rapid, high-pitched barks are usually signs of a happy or excited dog. Slower barking, or growling, usually means your dog is feeling aggressive or threatened. These kinds of barks will probably require you to move or change certain things in order to take away the thing he thinks is threatening him.In many cases, your dog’s barking is a way to get your attention because he is bored or anxious. He is expecting you to respond in some way. In order to stop him, the best thing will be to remain calm.
If you hear a sequence of short, high-pitched yelps (not barks), that is a sign that your dog is in trouble and needs immediate assistance.;
, Chances are your dog is barking at something, you need to distract him with something else. Giving him a command, something to do, will get him to stop momentarily.Don’t shout the command, as that will only encourage your dog's behavior. Instead, give your command in a firm, but understated tone. This helps let your dog know that he can calm down, and there is no reason to be anxious.
If you haven’t yet taught him to respond to a “Quiet” command, something else like “Sit” or “Stay” will work. You are trying to get him to turn his focus onto something else.

, In many instances, your golden will be barking at something, trying to alert you to its presence. This could be an animal, another person, or something else that has caught his eye. To get him to stop, you need to change his focus.Look at the direction your dog is barking, and stand between him and what he is barking at. This lets him know that you are not worried about the other thing, and that he shouldn’t be either.
This is a good time to give a command, something for your dog to follow. He will be looking at you, and should respond quickly. Make sure you remain calm so that he knows not to get excited.

, If your dog is still barking and not calming down, grabbing his muzzle can quiet him down quickly. This is how wolves quiet noisy members of their pack, which is especially important for them when hunting.Reach the fingers of one hand under your dog’s collar to hold his neck in place, then place your other hand over the top of his muzzle. This mimics the way a wolf will close his mouth over a noisy member of the pack.
When wolves grab the muzzle of others, they usually accompany it with a low growl to get the point across further. Add a command like “Enough” or “Quiet,” and make sure to say it in a calm, low voice, to give your dog a similar command.

, If your dog is barking at you, he is trying to get attention. Don’t give it to him by responding with a command or other forms of attention. Instead, you should wait for him to stop barking before responding in any way.Once your dog stops barking, then you can reward him with attention or a treat. He should get the idea that silence is the way to what he wants. Once he begins to understand that, stretch out the time he must be silent before rewarding him.
If you need to put your retriever in the crate, he will probably bark to show his displeasure. If he does that, turn your back on him and ignore the barking. Make sure he can see that you aren’t responding to his barking.

, Dogs learn more quickly when they are praised than when they are reprimanded. By giving the dog some treats, you are telling him or her, “You are rewarded because you quit barking!” Wait until your dog has gotten quiet to give him a treat.If you are in the early stages of training, treats are good to start with. Later on, you can switch out the treats for regular dog food, which will usually get a good response. If you don’t have treats available, positive treatment like petting and saying “Good dog” will help get the point across.
Do not give any treats or positive reinforcement until after your golden has stopped barking. If you respond too quickly, he will either get confused, or think that barking is what got the treat.

, This is a good command to know, because it can give you a quicker response when you want your retriever to stop barking. Create a situation that causes your golden to bark. It could be ringing the doorbell, or having someone walk by a window while he is inside.
Hold a treat next to his nose, and calmly give the command. You can say something like “Quiet” or “Enough.” Just keep it simple and consistent, so that he can learn what the command is and what it means.
When he gets quiet, give your dog the treat. Keep doing this, each time waiting longer and longer after he stops barking to give him the treat.
Like any trick, the training will require you to have some patience while your dog learns how to respond. He may try to test your limits, so be firm and consistent.
If your dog doesn’t seem to be getting it, and takes a long time to get quiet, you can withhold treats even if he does calm down. Wait a short amount of time after giving the command, about 10 seconds, and don’t reward him if he takes too long to quiet down. Make sure you do give the command once he has stopped barking, so he’ll know to associate the words with not barking., Goldens are active dogs, and love to play with people and other dogs. If they don’t have enough to do, they will get bored, and bark to express their boredom.Make sure your golden gets enough exercise. Letting him out to pee every morning is not enough. Run around, throw things for him to fetch, or just take him for walks to keep your dog active and healthy.
Your dog may growl during play, especially while tugging on objects you are holding. As long as he avoids troublesome behavior like biting, and doesn’t show signs of discomfort, this is acceptable behavior. Just don’t growl at your dog. He will likely interpret this as aggressive behavior. This can lead him to either become more aggressive in response, or become afraid of you.If your golden starts barking while playing, make sure you identify what is causing his barking and respond appropriately. Stop the play session until you have resolved the issue and the barking stops.

, This can be hard, because normally we are happy to see our furry friends. This is especially true with golden retrievers, as they are friendly and loving pets. Let your dog know there are appropriate times for excitement.This is especially important when leaving or returning home. Your dog will probably be excited to see you, and run to you with an excited greeting. You need to remain calm, and not shower him with praise and petting. This tells him you coming home is a big deal, and he will get excited anyone arrives. He will also get more anxious when you leave and bored when you are not around. A bored golden is one that will bark more often.

, Like all dogs, golden retrievers are creatures of habit who love routine. He does want to do the right thing. Be calm and consistent in your commands and training, and be prepared to withhold treats and praise when your dog doesn’t deserve them.If you are inconsistent in your responses, whether through the way you react, or even the tone you take while doing it, your retriever will get confused. He won’t be able to follow you appropriately. Remember that your dog is not trying to defy you. He is just trying to figure out the limits you are putting on his behavior.

, In rare cases, your dog may be barking as a sign of another, more serious, behavioral problem. If you are concerned, or unable to break him of the habit, talk to your vet about ways to stop the barking.


You can also talk to a dog trainer, who may be able to tell you if there is something you are doing wrong in your responses to barking.

Brush your friend every day.
Brush your friend at least three times a week, if you can’t do it every day.
Spend as much time as it takes to brush your dog’s entire body.
Brush with the grain, rather than against the grain of your dog’s hair.;
, De-shedding tools are special types of brushes that are designed to remove loose hair from your dog’s coat. Using a de-shedding tool will remove hair from your dog’s coat that might not come out during a normal brushing. Consider the following:


Set aside 15 to 30 minutes to use your de-shedding tool.
Use the de-shedding tool in the direction of your Golden’s fur. Do not de-shed against the grain.
There are a number of de-shedding tools on the market. Do a little market research before buying to figure out which is best for you. You might find that premium de-shedding tools like the FURminator are well worth the extra money. You might also find that a little known brand might be just as effective for a substantially lower cost.
Using a de-shedding tool should not be a substitute for brushing. If you choose to use a de-shedding tool, continue your brushing regimen.
De-shedding tools are much more abrasive on your dog’s skin, so don’t use them more than one a week., Bathing your dog will help remove dead hair and prevent extra shedding. It will also help keep your dog's coat healthy. Dogs with healthy coats shed less. Consider:


Use warm or lukewarm water.
Try to bathe your friend every month if you can.
Bathing your dog too often can result in dry skin.

, Good quality shampoos are extremely important in hair and skin health. For dogs with healthy hair, you want a shampoo that will clean dirt and grime out, while not drying your dog’s skin. Some dogs might require a prescription shampoo geared towards health and skin problems. But regardless of your dog’s overall health, a quality shampoo is very important in managing shedding and skin health.


Contact your vet if your dog has a special condition or medical needs.
Many people recommend a good oatmeal shampoo.
There are a wide variety of shampoos on the market, so visit your local pet store., As shedding dogs, Golden Retrievers do not need to have their hair cut. However, professional groomers can do a few things that might possibly cut down on the amount of hair your dog sheds in your house. They will:


Trim the hair around your dog's ears.
Trim the hair around your dog's pads.
Trim and groom your dog's tail.
Remember, as shedding dogs, Golden Retrievers should never be shaved., Allergies are a major source of pet shedding. Allergy related shedding is often related to your dog’s scratching his irritated skin, which not only damages the skin, but loosens his hair. As a result, pay special attention in the spring and summer, when certain allergens might be irritating your Golden and causing increased shedding. Contact your vet if you think your Golden has an allergy.

, There are a wide variety of medical conditions and chronic ailments that will cause your Golden to shed more than normally. As a result, you need to monitor your friend closely to make sure that he does not show any of the signs of chronic or life threatening diseases which have shedding as a symptom.


If your dog has patches of fur missing inexplicably, contact your vet.
If your dog’s hair is thinning and not regrowing properly according to seasonal changes (more hair in winter, and shedding in spring and summer), contact your vet.
Talk to your vet about any other changes with your dog’s skin, hair or general health., Flea, ticks, and other parasites on your dog will irritate him and cause him to scratch himself. This will damage your dog’s skin and as a result cause more shedding. Controlling fleas and parasites on your dog will help reduce the amount of loose hair you’ll have to deal with in your home.


Keep your dog on a regular anti-flea and tick medication (consult your veterinarian).
Investigate any scratching your dog might be doing. It could be caused by fleas or other parasites.
Bathe your dog regularly, and if needed, use a shampoo that repels or kills fleas or ticks (consult your veterinarian)., Dogs tend to shed more when they are stressed out. If you create a calm environment for your friend, your friend will shed less. There are a number of factors that might stress your Golden out. Consider:


A change in your family structure. This might mean the addition of a family member, like a new baby. It could also mean the death of a loved one.
A move. If you move, your friend might be unsettled and this could cause him to shed more. In this case, your Golden will probably start to shed less as he gets used to his new surroundings.
Parties, house guests, or other commotion in the house. Generally anything that is different at your home might stress your friend out. If you’re worried about shedding, try to limit such changes., Making sure your dog has plenty of water and is properly hydrated is key to preventing excess shedding. This is because a dehydrated dog might have dry skin, which will reduce hair quality and result in more shedding. As a result, a dog that has constant access to clean fresh water will often shed less., A good diet will result in a healthier dog and a healthier coat. Some of the essential elements of a healthy diet are: This will help reduce shedding.


Your food should have necessary vitamins and other nutritional requirements.
Your food should be rich in digestible protein.
Your food should have plenty of fatty acids.

Be aware of how hypothyroidism develops in your golden retriever.,
Note if your dog has low energy.,
Check if your dog starts to gain weight.,
Look at your dog’s coat for any dullness or patchiness.,
Check your dog’s heart rate.,
Look for enlarged nipples and shrunken testicles on a male retriever.,
Let your vet perform a physical exam of your dog.,
Tell your vet if your dog is on any medications.,
Allow the vet to run blood tests on your dog.,
Have your vet run a thyroid stimulation test.,
Discuss your dog’s treatment.",How to Diagnose Hypothyroidism in Golden Retrievers," Hypothyroidism is caused by a low amount of thyroid hormone in your dog’s body. Your dog’s thyroid glands sit on your dog’s neck on either side of his windpipe. They produce the thyroid hormone, which helps to control your dog’s metabolic rate. If your dog’s thyroid glands are underactive, the thyroid will be attacked by your dog’s immune system, leading to health issues.Golden retrievers are prone to hypothyroidism, and it most commonly occurs at 4-10 years of age. Other breeds such as Doberman, Old English sheepdog, miniature schnauzer, boxer, and Cavalier King Charles spaniel are also prone to hypothyroidism.;
, One of the major symptoms of hypothyroidism in dogs is the dog starts to display a lack of energy and mental dullness. Your dog may choose sleeping beside a heater or a warm area of the house rather than going outside for a walk. He may also display mental dullness, where he is not as energized and playful as he once was and does not make much of an effort to move around or respond to your commands.Dogs with hypothyroidism are sensitive to cold so you should note if your dog moves from his normal sleeping spot to a spot that is warmer or close to a heat source.
Some retrievers with hypothyroidism have been known to display a “tragic” facial expression where they always appear sad or in distress.

, Your dog may start to gain weight as a result of his low energy and mental dullness. He may also start to gain weight due to his thyroid issues, as he is burning calories less quickly and this can lead to a weight gain.You can determine if your dog has gained weight by weighing him on a scale. If you note any major weight gain (5-10 pounds) over a short period of time, this may be a sign of hypothyroidism.

, Dogs with hypothyroidism usually develop a brittle and dull coat, with patches of fur or hair falling out. Your dog’s coat may have a “rat’s tail”, where hair falls from his tail and exposes the skin underneath. It may appear as whip-like and rat-tail like.If the vet ends up clipping patches of your dog’s coat to run blood tests to determine if he has hyperthyroidism, the patch may not regrow for a few months.
You may also notice that your dog’s skin appears greasy. It may feel greasy to the touch. There may also be hyper-pigmentation, where areas that were once buff colored have a blue-grey appearance. Your dog may also itch his skin and may develop a bacterial infection or a yeast infection that leads to itchiness, which is due to his poor immunity.

, A dog with hypothyroidism may develop a slow heart rate, where his heart rate is below the normal rate for a golden retriever, usually around 60-100 beats per minute. Your goldie may have a heart rate that is at the bottom of this range or below it.You can check your dog’s heart rate by using a stopwatch or a watch with a second hand. You can also use the stopwatch option on your smartphone, if available.Hold one hand over your dog’s left side, just behind his front leg. Use the stopwatch or the watch with a second hand to count the number of beats in 15 seconds. Multiple this number by four to get his heart rate in beats per minute (bpm). If it is 60 bpm or lower, this may be a sign of hypothyroidism., If your retriever is male, you can check his nipples and his testicles. Note if his nipples appear enlarged or larger than usual, also known as gynecomastia. You should also note if his testicles look shrunken.

, If you note your dog’s symptoms are getting worse and you want to confirm his condition, you should take him to the vet. Your vet will do a physical exam to assess his health.She should check if your dog has another illness that is suppressing his thyroid hormone production, a phenomena known as “sick euthyroid syndrome”. This will prevent a misdiagnosis, as your dog’s thyroid levels can be low due to a secondary problem that is not hypothyroidism. Treating his illness should bring your dog’s thyroid levels back to normal if he is sick due to another illness or condition.

, Your vet should be told if your dog is on any medications, as one the side effects of pet medication can be the suppression of thyroid function.Medication that can cause thyroid suppression include corticosteroids and trimethoprim-sulphonamide antibiotics. Your vet may recommend not giving your dog this medication and allowing it to wash out of your dog’s system. This can then help your dog’s thyroid levels bounce back to normal.

, Your vet may run screening blood tests and blood tests specifically made to examine your dog’s thyroid hormone levels. The screening blood tests may note nonspecific changes in your dog like mild anemia and high cholesterol levels. But these are not specific enough on their own to confirm a hypothyroid diagnosis in your dog.


Specific blood tests for thyroid hormone levels and the presence of the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) are more conclusive. If your dog’s levels of TSH are high and his thyroid hormone levels are low, your vet can make a clear diagnosis of hypothyroidism in your golden retriever.

, This test is often done by vets if the blood results are inconclusive but your dog has clear symptoms of a medical issue.The thyroid stimulation test requires an injection of a form of TSH through an IV into your dog. The vet will then measure the amount of thyroid hormone produced in response to the TSH about six hours after the injection. If your dog’s thyroid glands do not produce extra thyroid hormone in response to the TSH in your dog, this is a clear sign of hypothyroidism.

, Once your vet confirms your dog’s diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, the treatment is relatively simple. You will need to give your goldie a thyroid supplement twice a day in tablet form.Within four to six weeks of treatment, your goldie should start to recover and be the healthy, energetic dog he was before. He should enjoy walking, running, and playing again. His coat should also grow back.

Test your Golden Retriever for mange.,

Take a skin biopsy.",How to Diagnose Skin Allergies in Golden Retrievers," CAD is common in certain breeds, particularly Golden Retrievers. The telltale sign of skin allergies is itching, which can range from mild to severe. It can be localized to certain parts of your dog’s body, or spread all over.The itching is caused by an exaggerated immune response: mast cells (part of the immune system) become activated and release a substance called histamine that causes your dog’s skin to itch.If the itching is severe, your dog might eat, sleep, or play less because he feels so miserable.Other than scratching to relieve the itch, your dog will rub, lick, chew and bite different parts of his body (e.g., face, armpits, feet).
Skin allergies can sometimes lead to ear infections, so your dog might start shaking his head because his ears feel itchy. This head shaking can lead to the development of a hematoma (large mass of blood) on his ear.Clinical signs of skin allergies usually start appearing when a dog is 6 months to 3 years old.;
, The more your Golden Retriever scratches, the more damaged his skin will become. Most noticeably, his skin will become very red. His skin may also develop hyperpigmentation, and become crusty.In addition, his skin may become dry or oily.His skin may also start developing scales.The scratching can lead to secondary bacterial or yeast infections on the skin, which would make the skin smell bad.Small red dots, called macules, can form on your dog’s skin because of all of the scratching., Your dog’s skin won’t be the only body part affected by a skin allergy. For example, you may see reddening and hair loss around his eyes and muzzle. You may also notice his ears looking red. His fur will likely have patches of hair loss where he has been scratching., CAD is either seasonal or non-seasonal. If your dog seems to be particularly itchy in the late summer or fall, he may have a seasonal skin allergy due to pollen or other air allergens. If he has year-round itchiness, he probably has developed a skin allergy to something inside your home, like dust mites.Knowing when your dog becomes extra itchy will help your veterinarian diagnose the skin allergy.

, CAD is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that other causes of itchiness must be ruled out before CAD can be diagnosed.CAD is the second most common canine skin problem behind FAD, so your veterinarian will probably want to rule out FAD first.Treatments for FAD include medicated flea and tick shampoos, flea and tick sprays, and topical flea preventatives. Use the spray in a well-ventilated area.Use these products according to the product label instructions, as well as your veterinarian’s instructions.
You can also get rid of fleas by vacuuming your home more frequently and washing your dog’s bedding hot water.
If your dog is still miserable and itchy after being treated for fleas, then FAD can be ruled out.
Interestingly, fleas can trigger development of CAD., After ruling out FAD, your veterinarian will test for other skin parasites called mites: demodex, which causes demodectic mange, and Sarcoptic scabei, which causes sarcoptic mange (scabies). He or she will take a superficial skin scraping to check for mites under the microscope.If your veterinarian does not see mites in the skin scraping, he or she will likely rule out mange.
Even if no mites are present, the skin scraping may reveal bacteria or yeast, indicating a secondary skin infection caused by the scratching. Your veterinarian will treat your dog for these infections.

, Food allergies can make your dog feel itchy. After the external parasites have been ruled out, your veterinarian will want to rule out food allergies. Proteins are a common trigger for food allergies in dogs, so your veterinarian will recommend switching your dog to a hypoallergenic food that contains a protein he has not been eaten before (e.g., duck, kangaroo).A food elimination trial involves feeding your dog only the new food for 8 to 12 weeks to see if his allergy symptoms go away, then re-challenging him with his old food to see if the symptoms come back.If your dog’s itchiness persists throughout the food elimination trial, your veterinarian will likely rule out a food allergy.
Hypoallergenic foods are available through your veterinarian.

, In addition to ruling out other skin issues, your veterinarian may want to perform advanced diagnostics to determine what's causing the skin allergy. After drawing a blood sample, your veterinarian will send it to a diagnostic lab that will screen it for antibodies to different antigens (a substance causing an allergic response), such as pollen or dust mites. Unfortunately, blood tests can sometimes produce false positive results, meaning the test indicates your dog is allergic to something that he is really not.Blood testing is not as accurate as intradermal skin testing. Also, results can take up to 2 weeks., For intradermal skin testing, your veterinarian will inject small amounts of various allergens into your dog’s skin and watch for a skin reaction. First, he or she will shave a postcard-sized patch of your dog’s fur and make several rows of dots on the skin with a pen or marker. These dots will be where your veterinarian injects the allergens.Your dog will be sedated for the procedure.After the injection, your veterinarian will monitor the skin reaction for 15 to 20 minutes and grade it according to the redness and size of the injection site.Swelling at the injection site indicates a possible allergy.Intradermal skin testing is more accurate than blood testing, but false results can occur for a number of reasons, including bacterial or fungal contamination of the allergen, too little antigen injected, and poor injection technique., Your veterinarian may want to take a skin biopsy to diagnose your Golden Retriever’s skin allergy.A skin biopsy is an invasive procedure, so your dog would need to be anesthetized. With all of the other diagnostic options available, it is not very likely your veterinarian will recommend a skin biopsy.

If you’re thinking about getting an Italian Greyhound, make sure you have plenty of time for both snuggling and activities.Do your best not to leave your Italian Greyhound alone for more than a few hours. If you can, stop at home during your lunch break for a quick walk. Spend nights and weekends giving it plenty of affection if you work during the day.;
, Even though they love to nap and sit on laps, Italian Greyhounds are swift and agile, and need a moderate amount of exercise. Go on a couple 15 to 30 minute brisk walks a day.Daily running or sprinting helps strengthen their legs and prevent the risk of injury.
Their size makes them great apartment dogs, and they don't really have any breed-specific space requirements. However, they do benefit from having an enclosed area large enough to sprint and exercise their legs.
Avoid play with young children or larger dogs and other situations that could cause your dog injury. Be especially careful about your puppy’s playtime, as young Italian Greyhounds are particularly fragile.

, This breed loves to stalk and chase prey, so having balls and fetch toys is a must. Give it chew toys and stuffed animals that it can hunt and chomp on so it doesn't get bored. Making sure it has toys to chew will cut down on any possible damage to your furniture and clothing.A bored Italian Greyhound, like many breeds, can get mischievous and chew up your belongings. Make sure it has its own toys to keep it busy.

, Since they’re so intelligent, Italian Greyhounds enjoy the mental exercise that comes with training. Start out with basic word commands, such as sit, stay, and come.Hold a treat out, say the command, and gently guide your dog into the proper position when just starting to train. Repeat ten or twenty time to make it automatic, and make sure to give a treat and positive encouragement when your dog follows the command.
Keep training session short and fun, since Italian Greyhounds typically have short attention spans. Always make training rewards-based by using treats and incorporating it into playtime.

Leave the dog in a crate while at work or at night, letting it out every few hours if possible.Don’t scold your dog if you come home to find a mess. If the dog had the accident hours earlier, it won’t make a connection between being scolded and going to the bathroom inside.
Try leaving pads or paper mats out if you don’t want to use a crate.

Get a crate.,
Prepare a bed.,
Create safe areas.",How to Care for a Greyhound1," Your greyhound is used to sleeping and eating in a crate already. A crate is a familiar housing that allows your greyhound to have personal space in your home. You can get a plastic crate (e.g. airline crate or Vari-Kennel) or a metal/wire crate.Airline crates are less expensive and are good for traveling. They also offer better protection in case your greyhound has an accident.
A metal crate is more expensive, but is a better option if you plan to wean your greyhound off of the crate. The metal crate will allow your dog to see what is happening in the house and allows your greyhound to become acclimated to the new environment more quickly.
Folding metal crates are available and can be more convenient if you will not use the crate all of the time.;
, You can either buy a bed or make a bed for your greyhound. If you purchase a bed, look for a bed that is washable and at least 34"" x 44"" if rectangular or 50"" if round. If you make a bed, placing an old, thick comforter on the floor will be fine.You can place a thick piece of foam rubber under the comforter to make the bed extra comfortable.
If your greyhound will rest in multiple rooms, you will need to have comforter in each room.
A well-padded bed is absolutely necessary because greyhounds are very thin.

, Use baby or dog gates to create safe areas for your dog when you are not at home. Stairs should be blocked using gates because greyhounds are not used to climbing stairs. Also keep tops on any garbage containers and remove them from this safe space. This area can be used to keep your dog safe until he is housebroken.Choose a safe area that does not have glass doors or windows. Your greyhound does not understand glass and may try to go through the glass.
Kitchen counters and dining room tables are at the nose level of your greyhound. Remove food from these areas until your greyhound understands boundaries.

Have your Lab neutered or spayed if it has not already been done.,
Take your Lab on walks.,
Train your Lab.,
Enjoy the experience.",How to Raise a Labrador Retriever," Labs can be a handful, and they definitely need a lot of exercise. If you are a busy person/family you might want to consider:  


Can I give him walks? Labs need at least one, sometimes two, walks a day.
Can I provide for him? Labs need food, toys, food and water bowls, bones, beds, etc. That can cost a lot of money.
Can I give him exercise? Labs not only need walks, but play time. Throwing a ball around for half an hour every day, along with one or two walks, can often be a hassle.
Will my kids/spouse help with the dog? If you are the only one taking care of the dog, he's not going to consider the other family members his pack. If one day you are gone and they are left to take care of him, he might not be comfortable. Everyone in the family has to have some kind of connection with a Lab, especially because Labs are loyal.
Can I give him love? What Labs need most is love. Will you be mad if he licks your face? Will you let him cuddle with you? Labs are caring, loving dogs. If you don't pet them or hug them, they won't think you appreciate them being there. You need to make sure he knows you will always love and care for him.;
, Will you buy a shelter dog, a dog from the pet store, or from a backyard breeder (someone who breeds dogs from their own home).


Because shelters often have an overload of dogs who need homes, their dogs are often free or available at a minimal cost which covers vaccinations, worming, and incidental care. However, it is important to understand that shelter pets may have been strays or abandoned, and might have health or trust issues. It is prudent, therefore, to ask the shelter workers if they know the background of the dog.
A dog from the pet store is usually a safe bet, even though they can cost more money and, sometimes, a lot of money.
Purchasing from a qualified, registered breeder will ensure quality and also gives you someone who will answer your questions when needed. Check with the relevant dog breeder's association for suggested breeders and to be certain that the breeder is registered.
Backyard breeders may be cheaper, but they may not be running a legal operation and may not have the dog's best interests at heart. Always find out first if the breeder is reputable.

, If the Lab you want is the runt, he might be able live in a big apartment. If the Lab you have your eyes on is one of the biggest dogs in the litter, it will be better for the dog if you live in a house with a fenced yard. If he has an ongoing medical condition, it is prudent to ensure that you are close to a vet or pet hospital. Keep in mind that all Labs need a large play space such as a yard or park.

, Be sure to look at the little things that won't affect your relationship with him but can still be an important part of your personal choice, such as:


Color
Age
Gender
Markings (white spot on chest).

, Go to a pet supply store and get all the essential things. Make a list so you don't forget anything. Your list should include:

Food






Treats






Toys






Food and water bowls
Leash
Collar
Bones
Bed
Crate/cage
Dog tags (with your number in case he runs away or gets lost).

, Your dog needs a name. If you pick a name that fits his personality, you may have to be with him for a couple of days. However, it's important to try to choose the name as quickly as possible. You will use this name for the rest of your life, and you don't want your Lab to grown up thinking his name is ""puppy"".


Here are the top 10 names for male dogs:Max, Buddy, Charlie, Jack, Cooper, Rocky, Toby, Bear, Jake and Buster.
Here are the top 10 female dog names:Bella, Lucy, Daisy, Molly, Lola, Maggie, Sadie, Chloe, Sophie and Bailey.

, It's natural for the puppy to be shy and uncomfortable when first taken away from his mother to a completely different environment with strangers taking care of him. Your dog will open up to you eventually, but until then, keep loving and caring for him. He will soon understand you won't do anything to hurt him.

, Since you will be taking him on walks often, make him comfortable with his surroundings. For the first few days, take him on long strolls, around the neighborhood. He will enjoy a really slow walk. Let him sniff everything he wants to.

, The vet will give you pointers on how much the dog should eat and how often. The vet will give you the dog's weight and tell you if he's overweight or underweight. Your Lab will need some vaccinations; your vet will give these to him if they were not already taken care of by the shelter or previous owner.

, Labs are always hungry, so make sure he gets proper nutrition.

, There will be other dogs in your neighborhood, so it's good for your dog to get to know them. Schedule play-dates. It is healthy for your dog to play with other dogs. If your dog spends all his time with people, he might  be uncomfortable, nervous, and scared is he sees or makes contact with another dog.

, Unless you want your dog to breed, prevent the increase of unwanted puppies by doing the right thing.

, Walks are very important to dogs. They need time to go out and get fresh air. Either do two short walks a day, or one long walk a day. If you do not have a chance to take him for a walk, the best you can do is play with your dog.

, Labs are very intelligent, so it shouldn't take long for your dog to understand and respond to commands and expectations. Potty-training should only take one to four months. Training him to sit, lie down, shake, stay, roll over, etc. can be easy if you are dedicated, determined, and patient. Start to train your dog when he is young, though; the older a dog gets, the harder it is to train him.

, Having any dog is fun, but having a Lab is even better. Be sure not to always be negative about your dog pooping on the carpet. Be positive about your dog learning a new trick!

Feed your dog a high protein dog food.,
Choose a high fiber food.,
Give your dog smaller portions.,
Eliminate treats.,
Remove any constant food sources.",How to Prevent Obesity in Labrador Retrievers1," One healthy food option to help reduce your lab's weight is a high protein food. Protein helps keep your dog’s metabolism high and gives him energy to stay active. This is generally a more tasty food for the dog, but might not be a filling and satisfying that way to a dog used to eating more food.If you choose to switch dog food, do so gradually over a period of one to two weeks. The first two day mix the dog food: ¼ new food with ¾ old food. The next four days mix the dog food: ½ new food with ¾ old food. The next two to four days, mix the food ¾ new food with ¼ food old food. Finally, your dog should be transitioned to the new food.If the dog leaves the new food in the dish, make a more gradual transition to the new food. If it absolutely refuses the new food, consult your veterinarian for advice.;
, Another option you may consider for your lab is a high fiber diet dog food. This type of food will be more filling to the dog while providing all the nutrients she needs to stay healthy while on the food. A high fiber diet help stimulate your dog’s metabolism.The downside of a high fiber dog food is this can be a bit less full of flavor so the dog may not like it as much.

, Labrador retrievers love to eat. Owners often give into the lab's cute face and begging and feed her more food. However, this helps lead to obesity.If you don’t want to change your dog’s diet, you can feed her a normal diet, but reduce the portion sizes. This uses your dog’s current food, but cuts down on the normal daily portion size you’ve been feeding her.


Recommendations vary, but try cutting 15 or 20% of her food from her diet., Another way you can cut calories in your dog’s diet is to eliminate all treats. Feeding your dog treats can cause weight gain or block the efforts to lose weight since each treat adds extra calories to the daily caloric count. Your lab probably loves treats and begs for them. Try to limit how many treats you give to your lab.If you feel a need to feed treats, get a good commercial one specifically made for dieting dogs.


You can give your dog vegetables or rice cakes for snacks instead of more calorie heavy choices.
If you know your family will give the dog treats, ration out the amount of treats that your dog can have each day.You can also place a few pieces of the dog’s daily dog food in a sandwich bag and use as treats.

, Many people leave food down for their dog to eat throughout the day. Because Labrador retrievers are greedy dogs who are always hungry, you should carefully monitor what your pet eats.You can control what your dog eats by removing the bowl of food and only feeding your dog at set meal times.If your dog was used to having food out to eat at all times, you will need to begin feeding your dog two or three times a day. She has proven she can’t control her eating if food is out all day, so you need to institute this control for your dog.

A healthy weight for a Labrador retriever is between 55 and 80 pounds.Male labs may weigh five to 10 pounds more than females and be considered healthy.
Make sure to base the healthy weight on your lab's build. Determine if your lab is small or large, stocky or lean, or tall or short.
Labs have a tendency to gain two to three pounds each year between the ages of one and five, which can lead to obesity when your lab hits the middle age mark.If your lab is nearing the 100 pound mark, she is obese.

, Preventing obesity in your Labrador retriever is a lifelong endeavor. It takes proper feeding and exercise to keep a dog at a healthy weight. Check your dog’s weight once a month. If you find out that she is gaining weight, it is time to take steps to help her lose weight.A simple way to determine if your dog is overweight is to run your hands along her ribs. If you feel a padding of fat and have difficulty feeling the ribs, your dog is overweight.
It should take about six to eight weeks for your dog to lose weight.

, Feed your Labrador retriever properly from the moment you get her. This helps prevent your dog from gaining weight in the first place. A high quality dog food is essential to maintaining a healthy weight. To choose a high quality dog food, look on its ingredient list. The top two ingredients should be meat and not a meat by-product.Meat provides your dog with more protein, which a dog needs to maintain a proper weight.
You can always ask your veterinarian for help in choosing a good quality food for your dog and one that fits your budget. However, remember that food is the most cost effective medicine you can give your dog. Generally, it is more cost effective to invest in a good quality food than to try to correct medical problems later in life.

, Proper exercise and play are essential to developing muscle mass and to keep a bored dog from mindlessly eating. Exercising your dog can help keep her healthy and lower her body weight. Plus, exercising or playing with your dog is a great way to bond with your dog. There are many types of exercise that dog’s love and that may benefit your health as well.Games of fetch or chasing the ball outside are always a good choice for an active dog.
Walks are also necessity to keep a dog fit, especially a Labrador retriever. This is a great option for an elderly lab or a young lab puppy. A walk two or three times each day can do wonders for your dog’s health.
If you’re a jogger, your adult lab, older than 18 months, can jog with you. Keep in mind that running or jogging for sustained time, like longer than 20 minutes, is too much for dogs under 18 months as their joints and bones are still forming.
Dog parks are another good way for a Lab to get exercise, and to socialize with other dogs as well. As long as his or her vaccinations are up-to-date, dog parks are okay for your dog to visit. #*Agility training is an alternative way to get exercise and socialization in a structured training environment. Contact your local pet store or vet clinic to inquire about agility clubs in your area.

, Obesity in Labrador retrievers can cause a lot of medical problems. An overweight or obese lab has a shorter lifespan than one at a healthy weight. Labs are also at a higher risk for arthritis, joint, and skeletal problems when they are overweight.Obesity can also cause heart and liver problems, respiratory diseases, and lower immunity for labs.

Take your dog to the vet.,
Determine if your dog has an underlying medical condition.,
Recognize the health problems obesity causes.",How to Prevent Obesity in Labrador Retrievers3," If you already suspect your Labrador retriever is overweight or obese, visit your veterinarian for a checkup. The vet can guide you on the type and quantity of food you should feed your dog, how much weight a month your dog should lose, and your dog’s goal weight.If a health problem, like hypothyroidism, is causing your dog to be overweight you will need to treat the medical condition.

, Sometimes, your dog may gain weight because of a medical condition. Hyperadrenocorticism, also known as Cushing's disease, and hypothyroidism can cause weight gain. Hypothyroidism is a condition caused when the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. This slows metabolism down so the dog’s body has trouble keeping weight under control.In addition to gaining weight or difficulty losing weight, a dog with hypothyroidism may become lethargic, may lose hair, and may seek warm places as it feels cold.
Neutering or spaying a dog can also cause weight gain. A desexed dog requires about 10% less calories than an intact dog due to the decreased demands from the reproductive system.

, Overweight and obese dogs are prone to developing serious health problems.Chief among these are developing diabetes.Obese dogs are also at risk to develop painful osteoarthritis due to years of excess weight stressing the bones and joints.


In addition, overweight and obese dogs are at risk for high blood pressure, heart disease, and some forms of cancer.Obese and overweight dogs also have a tendency to be less energetic, sleep more, and to have fewer interactions with their family.

Recognize the symptoms of cataracts.,
Take your dog to the vet.,
Exam the eye.,
Run blood tests.,
Use preventative treatment with juvenile cataracts.,
Undergo eye surgery.,
Remove the eye in extreme circumstances.,
Help your dog adjust to the loss of vision.,
Learn what a cataract is.,
Identify juvenile cataracts.,
Understand senile cataracts.",How to Treat Cataracts in Labrador Retrievers," The first step in diagnosing your Labrador's cataracts is to look for symptoms. The main symptom of cataracts in Labradors is cloudy eyes. When you look into your dog's eyes, they will have a bluish, milky or cloudy appearance.Minor cataracts will often not impair your Labrador's vision. However, if the cataract has progressed, your dog will start to show signs of vision impairment. This may mean your Labrador walks more cautiously or slower than usual, or runs into objects more frequently.Your dog may also have trouble walking in dimly lit rooms or in the dark.
If your dog has cataracts due to diabetes, they may drink or urinate more often.;
, If you think your dog has either juvenile or senile cataracts, take them to the vet. The vet can run tests on your dog to determine the severity of the condition and advise you on treatment options., When you take your dog to the vet, the vet will use an ophthalmoscope to shine a light onto the lens and see if it casts a shadow on the retina. In addition, the vet will look for the presence of reflexes that cause the iris to contract to indicate the retina is healthy.In addition, the vet also will use magnification to check the lens itself and use their judgment as to whether the problem is a true cataract or a problem that mimics it.
Your vet may also do a tear test by placing a fluorescent dye into the eye to check for abnormalities., If the vet suspects that the pet has an underlying problem, they will run blood tests to check. This is important because the underlying disease also needs correction and treatment, not just the lens of the eye. Underlying conditions that may lead to cataracts include diabetes, infection, trauma, and even malnutrition., If a juvenile cataract is found in your dog, no treatment may be necessary. However, the vet may advise a preventative treatment, such as Ocu-Glo, to reduce the rate of deterioration.You can also give your dog Vitamin E or C to help slow the deterioration.You may consider limiting the amount of time your Labrador spends out in the bright sunshine because that can lead to eye damage.
Ocu-Glo contains antioxidants which protect and condition the lens from further oxidative damage, which could speed up the deterioration of the eye due to the cataract.

, For cataracts, there is not a medical treatment that will reverse the process. The vet may assess the dog to see if they are fit and well enough to be a suitable candidate for surgical removal of the lens. This is a specialist procedure and requires referral to a veterinary ophthalmologist.Removing the lens requires specialist equipment, including an operating loop microscope and a high frequency ultrasound device. The latter is inserted into the lens and is used to break down the lens material so that it can be sucked out and removed. This is done via a small incision in the cornea. Fluid is also pumped in at the same time to stop the globe from collapsing. The lens capsule is preserved and once all the debris is removed, an artificial replacement lens is positioned within the lens capsule.
In the right dog, this procedure is extremely successful. However, when complications occur, they can be very serious and even lead to loss of the eye. This is usually only suggested for young dogs or dogs born blind.Once the lens has become hard or if the dog's retina is damaged, then corrective surgery is no longer an option.
In general, the sooner a cataract is identified, then the better the outlook for phacoemulsion surgery.

, For Labradors with hypermature cataracts, especially if the cataracts have caused secondary problems such as glaucoma, then removing the eye may be the most humane option.Talk to your vet to see if leaving the eye alone and helping your Labrador adjust to impaired vision is a better option.

, If you have a dog with cataracts, you may decide against surgery. Your Labrador can live a full and healthy life with impaired vision due to cataracts. If you don't want your dog to undergo surgery, your dog can adjust to the loss of vision. You can help your dog by sticking to familiar walks so the dog can get their bearings.


You can also avoid moving furniture around in the house so that your dog knows where everything is.

, Cataracts, or cloudiness of the lens, affect the lens within the eye. The lens has the job of focusing light on the retina for pin sharp vision. Cataracts can develop for a number of reasons, but the most relevant types of cataracts for Labradors are juvenile cataracts and senile cataracts.Labradors are often afflicted by hereditary cataracts, which can present as juvenile or senile cataracts. Often, hereditary cataracts in Labradors will not cause blindness.The lens in the eye can be thought of in the same way as a lens in a camera. If the camera lens becomes dirty, light cannot pass through and no photograph is produced. A similar effect occurs within the eye.

, Juvenile cataracts develop in young dogs, around the age of one to three years old. However, they can occur in a range anywhere between eight weeks to eight years of age. There is no specific reason why juvenile cataracts develop, though most believe it is an inherited condition.Juvenile cataracts only affect part of the lens and there is a good chance they won't interfere too badly with your pet's vision. Your vet can examine the dog with an ophthalmoscope to look for the reaction of the pupil to light and check visual reflexes to assess if vision is adversely affected or not. It many cases, no further action other than monitoring is necessary.

, Senile cataracts develop in older dogs, and again there is no one reason for their development. Sometimes cataracts develop as part of the aging process distinct from nucleus sclerosis, which is a different condition affecting the lens of older dogs. Sometimes, cataracts can be secondary to a health problem such as diabetes or trauma to the eye.Senile cataracts can become dense and stop light passing to the retina, resulting in blindness. In some cases, the cataract becomes hypermature and causes the eye to change shape. This can cause the lens to shift out of position, which can create other problems such as glaucoma.

Feed it appropriately.,
Provide plenty of clean, fresh water.,
Walk your dog.,
Provide comfortable shelter.,
Groom your dog regularly.,
Trim your lab's nails.,
Clean your labrador retriever's floppy ears.,
Care for your lab's teeth.,
Provide routine veterinary care.",How to Care for a Labrador Retriever1," You labrador retriever has a huge appetite. It loves to eat, so it may carry its food bowl around with them, beg for food, or eat unconventional things. This is normal. The exact quantity of food you give your lab depends on which food you're offering and how many calories it contains. Follow the feeding guidelines on the food packaging, and increase or decrease the amount depending on whether the dog loses or gains weight on this ration.If your dog is more active than most dogs, then you should increase its food intake accordingly. For instance, if every morning you and your furry friend go for a 5 mile jog together, you should consider giving it more food than usual.
Obviously, you don’t want your labrador to become obese. If you cannot easily feel its rib bones anymore, then you are probably overfeeding it. At the same time, you should not be able to see its rib bones from afar.;
, Your lab will get very thirsty after exercise and will need to quench that thirst. It will drink more or less water depending on how active it has been and how hot it is outside. Do not limit your dog's water consumption. Unlike food, your dog will regulate itself. Dehydration can be fatal, so don't take any chances.

, You lab needs a lot of exercise in order to stay healthy. Walk your lab up to three times a day and if you can, take it on long walks of a couple miles or more.If you have a backyard, make sure that it is big enough for your dog to run around. Small backyards are not suitable for big dogs like labs.

, Whether your lab lives outside or inside, make sure that it has a space it can call its own. Include a large, durable dog bed. Your lab will paw at the bed constantly to get comfortable. Cheap beds will rip easily and can cause quite a mess.Giving your labrador its own bed will also help you train it to stay off of yours, if you are so inclined., Labradors are a short-haired breed that come in brown, black, and gold. For most of the year, your lab will remain fairly low maintenance. During the summer, you’ll want to brush it regularly — weekly is best — to remove loose hair from its coat. Brushing your lab will also help remove dirt and spread natural oils throughout.Don’t bathe your lab too often. The natural oils in your lab's fur can even help fend off fleas and ticks.Bathe your lab 3 or 4 times a year or whenever its stench gets too strong., Every 2 to 3 months, you should trim your labrador’s nails. If you take your dog on frequent walks, the hard pavement will naturally file its nails down. You can trim them at home or have a vet do it. In general, you can train your lab to sit still to have its nails trimmed. Just offer it a treat after every successful trip to your at-home doggie nail salon. Eventually, your dog will welcome it.Be sure to use proper dog nail trimmers. Human nail clippers won't work effectively. Secure your dog's foot in place and then quickly clip off the nail. Do not clip too close to the base of the nail. Doing so can be very painful and cause bleeding. Make sure that the nail does not curve back into the dog's paw or is too sharp to cause accidental damage., Your Labrador's ears can become breeding grounds for bacteria if not cleaned regularly and properly. Check the dog's ears regularly for any excessive or smelly discharge, and seek veterinary advice if you notice anything amiss. If you want to clean the ears, use a specific product designed for the purpose.


Do not use a Q-Tip to clean inside your dog’s ear. One sudden jerk could seriously damage your dog’s ear canal, The more active your lab is the more likely it'll have dental issues. Gum disease, loose teeth, cracked/fractured/broken teeth, root abscesses, and tartar build-up are all problems you’ll need to be on the lookout for. Take your dog to the vet for teeth cleaning 1 or 2 times a year. Routine trips to your vet can also help combat terrible breath. Since you are on the receiving end of so many slobbery kisses, this issue has probably crossed your mind and therefore is just one more reason why you should have your lab's teeth cleaned.Vets suggest that you brush your dog's teeth daily or at least several times a week. Purchase a speciality toothbrush and toothpaste from your local pet shop/superstore or your veterinarian. Several kinds of toothpaste are available, many of which come in tasty flavors - e.g. liver, chicken, and peanut butter - that your dog will enjoy.
Introduce the brush into your dog's mouth gently. Use your fingers to lift your dog's lips in order to expose their teeth. Work the brush in circles and go from tooth to tooth. Its back teeth will be the most difficult to get to, so save them for last. Make sure that you brush both sides of each tooth. Reward you dog with a treat afterwards., Every dog needs certain core vaccinations on a regular basis. It is a good idea to take your dog to the vet at least twice a year for routine exams to monitor its health and to establish a good relationship with your veterinary staff. If your pet should get hurt or is not acting normally, it is always a good idea to visit the veterinarian for an exam and medical care if needed. Your vet will also prescribe necessary medicines (topical and supplemental) to help ward off parasites like fleas and ticks.As your dog ages, you may see such health issues as hip dysplasia, epilepsy, or seizures. Your labrador retriever may also experience eye problems.If any of these are happening to your dog, immediately contact your vet and talk about possible treatment solutions or medications. An elderly dog with any such conditions should see a vet every two months or as advised by your vet."

They will have a lot of energy to spare every day, so a few long walks will become part of your daily routine. This will not only help exercise your pup, but also keep him happy.Make sure you spend at least 20-30 minutes walking your lab. A quick walk down the street and back won’t do much to curb all the energy he has, and he will be grateful for the time outside exploring.;
, Once your dog is a little older and better coordinated, you can try letting him run alongside your bike while you go for a slow ride. This will be a great form of exercise for him, and he will get to spend some quality time with you in the process.Keep your dog leashed while you ride. Just make sure the leash is loose enough to allow him enough space between himself and your bike. Watch for traffic and take breaks if your dog needs one! Practice caution when .

, Labs are notorious for their love of water. Everything from tiny puddles from the rain to backyard swimming pools are going to attract them to play. If the weather permits, take your dog for a swim!If your dog is still a little clumsy in the water, you can buy a special lifejacket for him to wear while he learns to swim. Visit a pet specialty store and know your dog’s measurements to get him the right size.

, Labs have a tendency to become destructive when left to their own devices. With all the energy they have and their love for playing and exploring, you might find your furniture or belongings will suffer the consequences if you don’t keep them busy.Provide your lab with plenty of toys to chew on and play with. Strong, durable chew toys are great options. Redirect those chewing habits and behaviors to toys and keep your personal belongings safe from a gnawing pup.

, Fortunately, labs are easily trained. They are especially eager to learn and to please their owners, so you’ll likely find that they pick up new skills and tricks fairly quickly as you train them.Enroll your dog in a training class that you can attend with him. The instructor will help you learn the skills you need to train your dog properly, and help you along the way.
Since they are easily excited and might have a higher tendency to jump up on people, make sure you train your lab to “sit” and “stay” early on.

, Labs love to be around people and other dogs, so find a local dog park to check out with your lab. Just make sure your dog is treated for flea and tick prevention to avoid taking any pests home from the park.


If you are thinking about adding another dog to your family, labs tend to mesh well with breeds like collies, golden retrievers, beagles, and corgis, as these breeds are also energetic and sociable. Also, consider adding a dog of the opposite sex, as dogs of the same sex might have issues with dominance., Labs are prone to obesity, which can ultimately cause problems with their hips, joints, and spine. Follow your vet’s instructions for feeding your dog, and avoid overfeeding him. Stick to a healthy dog food, and try not to give too many treats.


Dogs can enjoy healthy fruits and vegetables in place of normal dog treats. Things like blueberries, bananas, watermelon, apples, carrots, sweet potatoes, and cucumbers are great options. Avoid fruits and veggies that are toxic or harmful, such as grapes, onions, and avocado.Consider sticking to dry food with a little bit of warm water added to it before feeding your lab. This makes it more enjoyable and easier to digest. Also, try to avoid foods with animal by-products or meals in the ingredients list. Stick to foods with real meat as the first ingredient, rather than grains like corn. Chicken is a good choice for meat in dog food., Labs can be a bit mischievous when it comes to eating things they aren’t supposed to. They’re known for ingesting all sorts of non-food items, and sometimes having to have them surgically removed. Keep small toys and objects out of reach.Labs are also known to jump onto kitchen counters and eat anything they think might be food. If you don’t crate your lab when you leave home, make sure there isn’t anything for him to get into left out on table or countertops.

, Injured or broken toes, broken or curled toenails, small cuts or scrapes, and even minor burns on the pads of their feet can all happen while playing outside or going for a run. Make sure you keep an eye on your dog for any signs of injury or distress, and see your vet if he acquires any injuries, minor or otherwise.Keep your dog off of hot pavement. The pads of their feet are sensitive and can possibly be burned by these surfaces. If you wouldn’t walk barefoot on a given surface, think twice about asking your dog to do so.

, Hip dysplasia is common in larger breeds of dogs, and labs are prone to developing it with age, especially if they are overweight. It causes problems in the joint of the hip, which can be painful and debilitating over time.If your dog has issues standing up after lying or sitting down, is visibly in pain when his hips are touched or moved, appears to be limping or has a change in his gait, or even shows hesitance to run, walk, or go up stairs, see your vet. These could be signs of issues with your lab’s hips.

, Labs are very social dogs, so make sure your lab feels like he is a part of the pack. Avoid keeping your lab tied up outside, or kept out of the household. Labs love having family time, and are great around kids. Showing your lab that he is a part of your family can make him feel happy and secure. Any dog will be happier when he feels safe and at home, so keeping his home life joyful and inclusive will lead to a happy dog.

, One of the best ways to bond with your dog is to simply give him your time and attention. Playing with him, indoors or out, is a great way to do this. Not only does it show him love and affection, it also engages and stimulates him.Labs love to please their owners. Games like fetch will give him a sense of accomplishment when he brings the ball back to you and you praise him for it. These small exchanges make for a happy dog.

, Many dogs don’t actually liked being hugged or kissed, as they don’t interpret these gestures the same way humans do. A hug might make them feel trapped, for example. Watch your dog’s body language when giving him affection. If he tenses up or shies away, cease that behavior.To show you he wants you to keep petting or kissing him, he might come closer, or paw at your hand. If he wants you to leave him alone, he might pull away or get stiff. Respond to your dog’s signals and give him space if he needs it.

, Keep in mind that when you praise a dog and show him love and affection, he will likely associate that as a reward for whatever behavior he has just done. Make sure you show him affection when he has done something good or correct, rather than when he is doing something undesirable, like barking or jumping.If your dog has successfully obeyed a command, has eaten, has done his business outside, or has just come in from some exercise, these are all good times to offer him some love and praise. This will reaffirm those good behaviors.

This does not mean that you shouldn't adopt a dog with impaired vision. If just means that you should know what you are getting into before you adopt do it.


Dog breeds are created by choosing individuals of a similar appearance and breeding them together. A consequence of selective breeding is that it can amplify genetic problems that run in that line of animals. Thus, many purebred dogs have a weakness when it comes to certain genetic health problems. For Labradors, cataracts is one of those issues.;
, Keep an eye out for cloudiness in the eyes. It is important to spot the early stages of cataract formation.


When you look at your dog face on in good lighting, you may notice a subtle milkiness in the center of the eye (the pupil, which is normally black). This milkiness becomes denser with time and can then appear either white or even blue in appearance. One or both eyes may be affected.If an owner is considering cataract surgery the complication rate is reduced if the cataract is not already mature.

, The cloudiness associated with cataracts may have already impaired your dog's vision. This means it may have difficulty seeing objects in its path. This might show itself as clumsiness and the dog bumping into objects placed in its way, or it may have difficulty spotting a favorite toy that is right in front of it.


The dog may seem hesitant and unsure of itself when taken on an unfamiliar route. The dog may also stumble on stairs, and seem uncertain of its footing, stumbling up or down curbs.
If you notice any of these signs get the dog checked by a vet., Cataracts usually develop as part of the aging process and occur in middle-aged to older dogs. However, Labradors can develop an early onset form of cataract that develops around 1 - 3 years of age.


Because the retina is healthy in these dogs, and they have many more years of active life ahead of them, it is well worth considering cataract surgery., Another common reason for the development of cataracts is diabetes mellitus. The owner of a dog with diabetes should be especially vigilant for signs of cataract formation in their dog.

, The vet will complete a full physical exam. This may include blood tests to check for underlying conditions, such as diabetes, which could prompt cataracts or complicate treatment.


The vet may wish to assess the overall health of the eye, and check the retina is healthy and there are no inflammatory conditions or infections affecting the eye. This is not so much to diagnose the cataract but to check if the eye is healthy and cataract surgery would restore vision., The diagnosis is made by examining the eyes with an instrument called an ophthalmoscope. This is a magnifier lens with a light source attached. In a darkened room the vet will stand back and shine a light directly at the eye. He or she will look to see if the light reflects off the retina (a bit like red-eye from a camera flash) or if the lens blocks the light and casts a shadow on the retina (like a solar eclipse). If the lens is dense enough to block the light, then a cataract is present., One type of cataract surgery involves either physically removing the lens and replacing it with an artificial one. Another technique is called phacoemulsion. Phacoemulsion is a process in which the lens is broken down using a laser.Your veterinarian should have a suggestion about which treatment is best for your dog.

Show your lab a lot of affection.By nature, it is a very loving dog.,
Socialize your labrador retriever.,
Teach your children how to play with your lab.,
Supply your lab with plenty of toys.,
Teach your lab basic commands like sit, stay, and come.",How to Care for a Labrador Retriever2," If there's anything labrador retrievers love more than food, it is spending time with you - playing, snuggling, or simply following you around..


Don’t neglect your lab if it wants to play or cuddle up next to your feet while you watch TV. Your labrador retriever has not lost its pack instinct. Most likely, your lab views you as the leader or one of the leaders of its pack. So if you neglect your lab, it will be affected emotionally.

, All dogs are territorial. Your lab is no exception. It's natural for them to bark at anything and everything, but when conditioned properly, they aren't so ferocious. Make sure that you spend some time at home and out in public training your lab.If you have several dogs, you'll need to gradually introduce your new labrador retriever into the mix. Place them in a room or outdoor space divided by a fence of some kind. Let the dogs get a sense of one another. They learn a lot by smells, so give them 30 minutes or more to just take in their new companion. Next, let them get closer, but keep them on a leash. Do this several times, limiting their exposure to the other animal to half hour increments. Only when you are confident that they won't attack one another should you let them roam freely. Have them play together outside. Let them bond.The same rules apply to people. If your labrador retriever is going to get used to being around a lot of people, it needs to be introduced into these environments in a safe way. Keep your lab on a leash. Have surrounding people/strangers pet your dog and be kind to them. Tell them to offer their hand to your dog. Dogs love to smell people's hands in order to assess their scent. Do this frequently. Eventually, your lab will learn that people can be trusted., Generally, your labrador retriever will play well with children. However, if you have younger children, you will have to keep tabs on what they're doing with the dog at all times. Make sure the child isn't hurting or threatening your dog in any way or this may result in a physical altercation. Your dog isn't vicious. It doesn't hate your child. It might just feel threatened by it. If it scratches or bites, it is simply reacting instinctually to a threat. Do your best to limit this threat. Be present when your child plays with your labrador., Typically, your lab's favorite toy will be a tennis ball. This probably speaks to their inner ""retriever"". Since your lab was bred to fetch wild game, it makes sense that it would enjoy playing with something that is meant to be retrieved. You can find a myriad of other toys at any pet superstore. Dog toys are a great way for your dog to play and to burn off excess energy without having to go outside and run around., Teach it how to walk on a leash also. Labrador retrievers are an intelligent breed and are often easy to train - especially, when they are younger. A trained dog is more confident and better behaved. In addition, a dog that will listen to voice commands is safer in the event it is ever off-leash.When training your labrador retriever, be sure to reinforce positive behavior rather than chastise for negative. Never hit your labrador retriever. You are trying to build a trusting relationship with your dog, not create a neurotic and scared animal. Dogs that attack people or children without heed are often the product of cruel environments. Don't let your labrador retriever be one of them."

Poodle hair can easily get matted together as the dog sheds, and for this reason it is often recommended that poodles with long hair be brushed every day. Brushing once or twice every week is generally acceptable if the dog has shorter hair.Start brushing at the poodle’s neck and move down toward the tail.
Use a slicker brush to gently remove thick tangles and mats.;
, Mats or tangles that won’t brush out should be carefully cut out with scissors. It's important to remove mats whenever you find them, as they can pull at the skin, causing discomfort to your pet.


Because of the way they shed their hair, poodles are prone to matting if they go for long periods without grooming. In extreme cases, matting can cause skin infections that are painful for your pet.

, It’s important to bathe your dog, especially if he has gotten dirty while playing outdoors. You should be sure to bathe your dog before trimming him with clippers, as dirty or overly oily fur can prematurely dull your clipper blades. But bathing your dog too often can wash away the natural oils that your dog’s coat needs. The ASPCA recommends bathing your dog every three months or so, unless more frequent baths are required.Fill your bathtub with a few inches of water. Remember, it doesn’t need to be full, and your dog will likely splash around quite a bit. You’ll only need the water to be about ankle-deep.

, Some dogs treasure bath time, while others dislike being bathed. If your dog does not enjoy bathing, you may want to get a helper to aid you in keeping the dog in the tub during the bath.


Use a cup or a pitcher to flush water all over your poodle from head to tail. Try to avoid getting water in your poodle’s eyes and ears.

, If you massage your poodle's back while rubbing in the shampoo, he may enjoy the bath a bit more.


Use a shampoo specifically made for dogs. Not only does dog shampoo have everything your poodle’s coat needs to remain healthy, it also avoids ingredients in human shampoo that might be harmful to your pet.

, Continue rinsing with clean water until the water runs clear and no longer appears soapy.


Be careful not to get any soapy water into your poodle’s eyes and ears.

, Use a towel to gently dab and wipe your poodle’s coat from head to tail. You may want to brush your poodle’s coat again after the bath, then dry with a towel a second time after brushing.


Be sure to thoroughly clean and dry your dog’s ears with a towel or clean paper towels. It's important to clean inside and under your dog's ears to prevent bacteria, yeast, and parasites from living there.

, Use a toothbrush to gently remove plaque buildup around the base of your poodle's teeth. Choose a toothpaste made specifically for dogs. Your poodle will inevitably swallow some of the toothpaste, and human toothpaste can upset your dog's stomach.


Brush gently. Remember, your dog may not be used to having its gums rubbed. Brushing too hard or fast can cause pain to your poodle's sensitive gums.
Be consistent with your poodle's dental care. Brushing your dog's teeth can help prevent tartar buildup, which causes periodontal disease and can lead to potentially-fatal bacterial infections., It’s important to keep your dog’s nails trimmed, as having long nails can lead to painful problems for your pet. But you also want to avoid trimming them too short, as this can cause bleeding.You may be able to trim your dog’s nails with a pair of scissors, but you will likely find it easier if you purchase a specialty tool, like a guillotine trimmer.
Don’t cut the quick. This is the part of the nail closest to your dog’s “toes,” and it’s very sensitive and can bleed easily.
Ask your veterinarian or a professional groomer to help trim your dog’s nails if you have a hard time doing it at home.

, There are many different styles and cuts that poodle owners can choose from. Some common cuts are the Puppy Clip, the Continental Clip, and the Bikini Clip. While there are other grooming options, these are the most common.Consult a professional groomer on which cuts would be best for your dog. Remember, if you’re doing most of your dog’s grooming at home, you’ll need to commit to a certain amount of time and effort. Some cuts are easier to style and maintain than others.
All of the common styles involve trimming or shaving the poodle’s face, feet, and the base of the tail. The style of the poodle’s body fur changes significantly based on the chosen clip.

, Though it may seem tempting to buy a cheaper pair of clippers or scissors, getting a higher-quality product will be better for your dog. Better clippers are less likely to scrape your dog’s skin or pull his fur while cutting. A cordless clipper will make the grooming much easier for you!


High-quality clippers such as Laube, Andis, or Oster cost around $125-$175. They should last much longer than their less expensive counterparts.

Note that many groomers seem to prefer Andis or Laube over Oster, as Oster clipper blades can heat during trimming. If you do use Oster, you may want to have extra blades of the same size so that you can switch them out if they become heated.Good scissors made for grooming may cost around $50. These scissors should be sharp and comfortable for you to cut with. You may want to try out different models before purchasing them.

, Clippers have interchangeable blades that are numbered to indicate the length that they will leave the fur after trimming, with higher numbers indicating shorter fur.You will likely need a variety of clipper blades: start with a 5, 7, 10, 15, and 30.


If you cannot afford to get many different blades or you’re just starting out, begin with at 10 or 15.
Be aware that use of 30 and 40 blades can be quite difficult and should usually be left to experienced or professional groomers. Improper use of these (very short) blades can scrape or burn your poodle’s skin.

, Trimming takes some time, and if your pup is well-rested, he may not sit still long enough for you to finish. Taking him to the park or on a long walk for exercise before you begin may lead to a more cooperative subject., Before you begin clipping, turn the clippers on around your dog. This is especially important for a puppy or a poodle who has not been regularly groomed. Over time, your dog should become more and more comfortable being around the clippers.You may want to have a professional groomer clip your poodle the first few times so that you do not have to worry about both introducing your dog to the clippers and learning to clip the fur.

, The trimmer blade you select will be a combination of your dog’s skin sensitivity (white poodles tend to have more sensitive skin than black poodles), your level of expertise, and the reason for your trimming.


A higher blade number (such as 30) is often used by professional or expert groomers to prepare a poodle for showing. However, if you are not planning to show your dog or you are just starting as a groomer, a lower blade number (such as 9 or 10) should be sufficient.

, Turn the clipper on and place it just underneath the opening in the dog’s ear. Trim from the ear towards the eye, creating a line from the ear opening to the eye.

, Place the clippers right next to the inside of one eye and pull down towards the nose for an inch or two. Then move the trimmer over slowly until the area between the eyes has been shaved., Begin in the space you have just shaved between the dog’s eyes and shave down the poodle’s snout towards the nose.


Finish shaving the poodle’s snout by trimming from the nose along the sides of the lips/face back towards the ears.
Be aware that you may have to shave in more than one direction (up or down the snout, for example) to allow for differences in the direction in which the dog’s hair grows.

, Gently lift the dog’s snout and trim from the tip of the chin down towards the neck.


Shave the dog’s neck area, stopping when it reaches the chest. The shape can be in a V or a U from beneath the ears down to where the chest and neck meet., Almost every poodle clip involves leaving a puffy topknot on top of the dog’s head. To achieve a topknot, comb the hair on top of the poodle’s head up (away from its body) and then forward, so that it comes out over the eyes.Use scissors to cut a “visor” line just above the poodle’s eyes. Use scissors to trim a small arch above the dog’s ears.
Brush the topknot hair down towards the ear and use scissors to trim a straight line from the corner of the eye to the ear opening. (You may need to flip the dog’s ear back to clearly see the opening). , Style and shape the topknot by first brushing all the topknot hair to one side. Use curved scissors to trim uneven or overhanging fur. Then brush the topknot to the other side and do the same. Brush the topknot hair straight up. Tilt the dog’s nose down and see whether the topknot is in an oval shape. If there are square corners, trim them off with curved scissors. Look at the top of the topknot and make sure it is not pointy. If there is a peak or a point, trim it with curved scissors so that the dog has a nice, rounded topknot. , The trimmer blade you select will be a combination of your dog’s skin sensitivity (white poodles tend to have more sensitive skin than black poodles), your level of expertise, and the reason for your trimming.


A higher blade number (such as 30 or 40) is often used by professional or expert groomers to prepare a poodle for showing. However, if you are not planning to show your dog or you are just starting as a groomer, a lower blade number (such as a 10 or 15) should be sufficient.

, Begin above the pads on the feet and find the ankle. Trim down from the ankle to the largest foot pad. Cleaning up this area first should enable you to locate the dog’s ankle and set the ankle line. , Stretch the dog’s toe pads apart and use the clippers to trim in between each pad. There should be no long fur protruding from between the foot pads. , The poodle should have cleanly shaven feet, but the ankles should remain covered in longer fur. Be sure that you find where the dog’s ankle bends, and keep the shaved area below hocks. , Shave from the ankle down the top of the foot. You may need to reverse the direction and go up from the toes towards the ankle as well.

, Shave the webbing and sides of each toe. Try to pull the skin tight over the toe, which should pull the fur out and enable you to get to the hard-to-reach places a bit more easily. , Be sure that the ankle lines on each of the dog’s four paws is even. If one is slightly higher than the others, you may want to go back and trim them all to the same length. Beware of shaving them too high, however, or the cut will look strange. , As the name suggests, the Puppy Clip is acceptable for show poodle puppies that are under 1 year of age. The cut consists of longer fur that is more or less the same length with short-trimmed face, feet, and tail base.


Cut the poodle’s body and leg fur evenly. The puppy clip is generally done with scissors. Brush your poodle’s fur out neatly, then use scissors to trim the fur at a uniform length along the body and legs. You can do a cut similar to a puppy cut (called a lamb cut) with a very low number clipper blade (such as a 3, 4, or 5). This cut also leaves the fur at a uniform length, but may be a bit shorter than a puppy cut due to the use of clippers. , A Bikini Clip (also known as a Miami clip) is a good choice for poodles in warm summer climates. The Bikini Clip has a closely cut face, feet, and base of the tail. Above the feet, the fur is left very long in “poms” on each leg. The body is trimmed at a uniform length (based on the groomer’s preference).Trim the face, feet, and base of the tail with a 15 blade. Trim the body and legs with a 5 or 7 blade. Trim the topknot, pompoms, and tail pom with scissors.
Trim the stomach with a 10 blade. , This is the classic poodle look. The Continental Clip involves a very closely shaved face, feet, hindquarters, upper legs, and base of the tail. Very poofy pom poms are left just above the feet and at the end of the tail. The chest, head, and ear fur is left long but trimmed neatly.Shave the face and feet closely.
Shave from the base of the tail to several inches above the base.
Shave the front upper legs (from below the “elbow” joint down towards the ankle, but leaving a sizable pompom area over the leg hocks).Shave the back legs. Leave two “rosettes” or round areas of fur above the dog’s hips in the back, but shave from the rosettes down the dog’s legs to the pom-poms on the rear hocks.
Use scissors to trim the dog’s remaining long fur. All of the fur should be trimmed so that it is even and rounded.

Keep track of your dog's weight.",How to Diagnose Obesity in Labrador Retrievers," Obesity is considered an entirely preventable disease, and as a pet parent in charge of the can opener or the shopping, the responsibility to keep their pet a healthy weight falls squarely on your shoulders. The first step in doing this is to recognize that you need to be proactive about your dog's weight.This does not mean that you are a horrible pet parent if your Labrador is over weight. It simply means that you now need to prioritize keeping your pet at a healthy weight, in the same way that you prioritize taking it to the vet for annual exams and keeping it safe from harm.;
, The first skill to learn is observing your Labrador's body shape. When viewed from the side, the dog should have a tucked up abdomen from behind the ribs to the back legs, so that it has an evident elegant waistline. Dogs that are barrel shaped, or have a flat underline, are overweight.


Likewise, when viewed from above, the dog should have a waistline that goes in behind the ribs and in front of the pelvis. Again, dogs with parallel sides, or that bulge outward, are overweight.

, The essence of body scoring is to feel for prominent landmarks on the dog's body (such as ribs, backbone, or pelvic bones) and rate the amount of fat that covers them. If you understand how to do it correctly, you can use this to check the amount of fat cover on your dog's body and decide whether the dog is overweight.


The idea is to use your fingertips and run them along the dog's spine and over the ribs to see how well (or not) you can feel their bones. The ideal is to be able to detect individual bones (such as the bumps of the spine) but without the bones staring out through the coat.The scale either runs 1 - 5 (1 being emaciated and 5 being grossly obese), with 3 being the perfect amount of body cover, or 1 - 9, with 4.5 being perfect.To appreciate the perfect cover over the ribs, run the fingertips of one hand over the knuckles of the other, and that sort of bump-bump is the feeling you should get over the ribs.If you need to press hard to identify individual bones or you still can't locate bones, then the dog is overweight.

, If you think that your dog's weight is getting out of control, address the problem immediately. Schedule a specific exam with your veterinarian just to deal with this issue.


Your dog's annual exam is also a good time to assess and discuss its weight. This is especially true if you think your Lab is just slightly overweight and the issue doesn't require a lot of time or attention.

, Your veterinarian uses the same methods you do, body scoring, to assess whether or not your dog is at its ideal weight. However, they have the advantage of having seen countless dogs during their working life and knowing what is a healthy weight and what isn't.


Your vet also has the advantage of judging dispassionately without emotion blurring decisions.
In addition the vet will weigh the dog, as a reference.

, Your veterinarian can be a great resource for ideas about how to lower your dog's weight. The veterinarian may have suggestions for foods to feed the dog and about how to get your dog more physically active.


Because different dogs have different physical ability levels, based on their breed, age, and physical status, talk to your vet about what kinds of exercise would be good for your dog. Labradors, for example, are big dogs that can do a lot of physical exercise when they are young, but your dog may have physical issues that limit its ability to do certain types of strenuous activity.
Your veterinarian will be a good resource for information about feeding your dog because he or she understands the balance between getting enough calories in your dog to keep it active and happy, and still having it lose weight.

, Obesity is defined as being 20% over the top end of the normal range of weight. This extra weight represents an excess of fat. However, tables listing the desired weights for different breeds are of limited use for predicting what any individual dog should weigh.Instead, discuss your dog's ideal weight with its veterinarian, as he or she will have a better idea of what the dog's weight should be based on its actual frame.


For example the 'average' weight for a Labrador is quoted at 55 - 70 lbs. It might be tempting for someone with a heavy female Labrador that weighs 69 lbs to think their dog is OK, whereas when her small body frame and the fact she is female is taken into account, she is actually overweight.
These average weights can lull an owner into a false sense of security, whereas the owner should be judging the dog's condition based on the amount of fat cover over the dog's ribs and the shape of the dog.

, This will help you to understand what you need to change in order to help the dog lose weight. In its simplest terms, obesity is caused when a Labrador eats more calories than they burn, and the excess energy is laid down as body fat. In order to stop this from happening, the dog either needs to take in fewer calories, burn off more calories, or a combination of the two.


Some factors do have an impact, such as neutering, but this is due to a slight slowing of the metabolism rather than a predestination that a desexed dog is going to be fat. A neutered dog still has the ability to be at an ideal weight, it may just take further adjustments to diet and exercise.

, The Labrador represents a particular challenge because they are very fond of eating and don't seem to recognize when their stomachs are full. Thus, the Labrador owner cannot rely on their dog's own appetite control to govern how much to feed. It is not safe to assume a begging Labrador is hungry, no matter how convincing their appeal, because they will do a good impression of being starving even if they have just eaten.


A Labrador owner must be doubly vigilant of their pet's waistline so as to recognize a problem early while it easiest to remedy., Your dog needs to burn off more calories than it is taking in. This will allow the dog to lose some of the weight it has put on. Exercise it every day, several times a day.


When choosing what type of exercise to do with the dog, take into account your dog's physical fitness and its build.
This exercise could be as simple as getting in the routine of walking it in the morning before you go to work and walking it again when you return from work.
If your dog has a lot of stamina and the physical build for more exercise, consider taking it hiking or taking it along when you go for a run. This can also be something that you build up to together!

, Clearly, if your dog is overweight it needs to be fed less. This could mean continuing to feed it the same food, but just cutting down on the amount you are give it. It could also mean changing its food to a type that is designed to help it lose weight. Whatever you decide to do, it's best to consult with your veterinarian before making changes to your dog's diet and the amount you feed it.


If you are considering changing the type of food you are feeding your dog, remember that you need to make adjustments gradually. An abrupt change in food could put your dog's digestive system into shock and cause illness. Instead, gradually incorporate the new food into the old food over the course of a week or two, so that by the end your dog is completely on the new food., Once you have determined the Labrador needs to lose weight, you will use weight as a guide to determine whether a diet and exercise regime is successful.If you do not have a scale that your Labrador fits on at home, consider measuring its waist with a tape measure and using that to determine if it is losing weight.


Weigh or measure your Labrador once a week and write the measurement down for reference.
When measuring the dog, pick a landmark on their coat (such as a distinctive patch of hairs) to locate the measuring tape in the same spot each time.

Look for the first signs of gastric torsion and bloat.,
Pay attention to the signs of shock.,
Keep a close eye on large-breed dogs.,
Watch for signs in big dogs that eat quickly.,
Take your dog to the veterinarian as soon as possible.,
Approve additional testing.,
Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for treatment.",How to Diagnose Gastric Torsion and Bloat in Labrador Retrievers," It is important to spot this condition as quickly as possible, in order to get it treated swiftly. Initially, the signs of include:The dog appears uncomfortable with an anxious or stressed appearance.
The dog may stretch or pace.
The belly begins to get large or tight.
Drool or excessive saliva will fall from its mouth.
The dog will try to vomit but nothing comes out.;
, If nothing is done at the beginning of the dog’s condition, it will quickly get worse. The signs of shock will develop as the involved tissue begins to die and toxins are released into the blood stream. These signs include:Weak pulses in the legs
Difficulty breathing
Pale gums
Rapid heartbeat

, It appears that large breed dogs with deep chests are predisposed to develop this condition.This means that Labrador retrievers are prone to this condition.


It may be that a narrow thorax is responsible for the higher rates of GDV in large, deep-chested breeds., The eating behavior of the dog can also influence the development of GDV. Dog’s that are “greedy” eaters, gulping their food down and swallowing air as they gulp, can fill their stomachs with air. This means that those that are fed only one large meal a day can develop GDV more easily.


To decrease the risk of GDV, feed your Lab small and frequent feedings of its dog food. This means splitting up the total daily food amount into two or, better yet, three feedings.
Dogs that gulp their food can be slowed down by the use of a slow feeder. A slow feeder is simply a food bowl that has large pillars inside it that the dog has to work around to get to the food.The type of food fed can also effect the chances of developing GDV. Dry food listing oil(s) as one of the first four ingredients has been implicated in this condition., It is important to get your Lab under the care of a veterinarian quickly so that it can get treatment. Call your veterinary office and tell them about the situation. They should get you in immediately on an emergency basis.


If your veterinary clinic is not open, take your dog to an emergency dog clinic or hospital.
Gastric torsion and bloat are very, very serious. This is because the dilation of the stomach and subsequent twisting does not only affect the stomach. It can compress big arteries and veins in the abdomen, which can drop blood pressure and affect the liver. This can lead to shock and a serious, sometimes deadly, condition called disseminated intravascular coagulation or excessive blood clotting.The heart can also be affected by arrhythmia, or an irregular heartbeat., Your veterinarian may want to do additional testing to get a better sense of the overall health of the dog. Dogs that are suspected of having GDV will have blood work done at the veterinary clinic, which will include a complete blood count and blood chemistry tests.


These tests may show the dog to be dehydrated, toxic and/or in shock.
In addition, radiographs, or possibly an ultrasound, of the abdomen will performed. Radiographs (or X-rays) will show an air or fluid-filled stomach with a tell-tale sign called “double-bubble” or “Popeye’s arm,” in which the twisted stomach appears as two air filled bubbles., The immediate goal of treatment is to restart circulation through the stomach.Once a firm diagnosis is made, the dog will need to be stabilized with fluids and medication. It will then be taken to surgery to decompress and untwist the stomach.


Even after surgery, the dog will not be out of danger for a few days, due to the severe intestinal and circulatory problems this condition causes.

To start you need to make sure that the coat is clean.,
Do not put a conditioner on the coat it will make the coat too soft to scissor if you should have to give the dog a bath.

,
Make sure the coat is dry and not curly when drying by brushing it out from the skin of the dog till it is all dry from head to toe.

,
Now that the dog is fluffy, brushed and combed, you're ready to start the scissoring.

,
Now with the strait scissors start at the dogs hindquarters, and depending on how long the coat is you can do a longer cut by hand scissoring it (Except if the dog's coat is 5 or 6 inches long, then you would scissor off 3 inches or less.),
Make your first cut at the hindquarters.,
To scissor the legs you need start with the feet, seeing if the feet are clean is important, or if there is teddy bear feet hair left on!,
If the feet are clean you need to trim the hair up to where it looks like the letter U. Comb the hair down at where it bind its paw and trim the hair to where it doesn't fall on the ground the scissor the hair in till it is even and no hair uneven and you work your way around the dog till the body is done.

,
To do the head depends on how it is done; clean face or teddy bear.

,
To do the clean face you want to use a 10 blade.,
Set the top knot (the hair on the head) take the scissor and from the corner of the eye to the outer ear cut the hair hanging over the sides (being careful not to cut the eye or the ear).,
The teddy bear: Shave down the nose and trim hair over the eyes and round the hair on the sides and under the chin and blend it in on the back of the head but don't cut over the ears this time.

,
Go back over the dog to make sure there is no hair uneven by this the coat should be all even and fluffy.

Eventually, the cataract covering the lens can cause your dog to lose his vision. The cataract might look crackly or like a chip of ice.Cataracts form either due to genetic predisposition, trauma, diabetes or other diseases.;
, If a cataract is covering your dog's eye, she may have trouble seeing. As a result, she may be clumsier and less sure of her surroundings. You may also notice your dog:Bumping into things.
Not recognizing people.
Misjudging distances.

, Make an appointment with the veterinarian as soon as you notice the milky eyes. The vet can usually diagnose cataracts simply by looking at your dog's eyes and a veterinary surgeon can confirm the diagnosis.If your dog his older, his lens may simply be aging but it shouldn't affect his vision too much. The vet will check for this.

, Cataracts in the early stages may make her vision blurry, but a mature cataract will cause blindness, so you might want to surgically remove it. During surgery a specialist surgeon will remove the lens and replace it with an artificial one. Or, the cataract can be broken down by a laser in a procedure known as phacoemulsification.If you want your pug to get surgery, it's important to do it before your dog's vision worsens.

, If you see your dog's eyelid is rolled up and inward, he probably has a condition called entropion. The eyelid rubs directly against your pug's eye and can scratch or irritate the cornea. If your dog has had untreated entropion for a while, his eye might look milky or blue from scar tissue that develops over the eye.The eye may also swell up if the eyelashes are scratching against your dog's eyeball.

, Your pug may seem bothered by something in her eye. You might notice her rubbing her eyes or squinting a lot. Since eyelashes from the rolled out eyelid are rubbing against her cornea, her eyes may water a lot. Your dog might also blink a lot or try to hold her eyes closed.Entropion is painful. If you suspect at all that your pug is in pain because of something in her eye, you should take her to the vet.

, The vet will carefully look at your pug's eyes to see if they're symmetrical. The vet will also look inside your pug's eyes and will look at the cornea under magnification to see if eyelashes are rubbing. If the vet can apply pressure to the eye and the eyelid rolls into place but pops back when pressure is released, your pug has entropion.A veterinary ophthalmologist may also be asked to examine the eyes.

, A veterinary surgeon will remove a little of the tissue underneath your pug's eye. This can help the eyelid sit correctly and keep it from rubbing against the cornea. Or, if your pug is young, the vet may recommend tacking the eyelid above or below the lid so that the eyelid develops correctly as the pug grows.Surgery to treat entropion can be expensive.

, Pugs are one of the breeds that have a third eyelid. This sits on the inner part of the eye where it travels across the cornea in order to protect it. The eye is lubricated by tear fluid that comes from a gland in the third eye. If a gland on the third eye pops forward, you'll notice that a large round mass swells to cover the inner part of the eye.This red swollen mass often looks like a cherry.

, Most pugs aren't bothered by cherry eye, which is largely a cosmetic issue. But, if your dog seems to be bothered by it or if you aren't sure if he actually has cherry eye, you should get a veterinarian's diagnosis. Your dog may have a different eye condition if he seems to be in pain.It's thought that the glands in a pug's eyes can pop forward when connective tissue around the glands weaken, although vets aren't exactly sure what causes cherry eye.

, You can decide whether or not to remove the cherry eye through surgery. If you do want it removed, the veterinary surgeon will place the gland back into the right place and stitch it so it doesn't pop out. The surgery is done under anesthesia.If you don't want to do surgery, you can ignore the cherry eye (unless your dog becomes bothered by it) or try steroid ointments.

, Your dog's eyes may look dull, irritated and red. If your dog has keratoconjunctivitis sicca, also known as dry eye, her eyes aren't making enough natural tear fluid. A thick, sticky discharge can also keep seeping from the eyes.Pugs are one breed that are likely to develop dry eyes which are also more common in middle-aged to older dogs.

, Your pug will try to blink away debris and dirt while lubricating his eyes. But, he won't be able to if he has dry eye. You'll see your dog blinking often, squinting, or keeping his eyes shut.Scratches or infections can cause dry eyes., Since dry eyes can become infected, your dog will need medical care. During an exam, the vet will examine your dog's eyes and test for tear production. The vet will insert a special paper into the corner of your dog's eye. This will show how much tear film your dog makes in one minute and the vet will use the results to make a diagnosis.Other things could be causing the inflammation, like glaucoma or corneal ulcers so the vet will check for those conditions as well.

, Your dog will need over-the-counter eye drops or prescription medication to lubricate the eyes. Follow the dosing instructions. But, you'll probably need to apply watery artificial tears every hour or four to six times a day if you're using thicker drops. Some medications only need a few applications a day.The vet will probably have you cut back on using medication after your dog's eyes are producing tears again. But, since dry eye is a chronic condition, your dog will probably need to use some lubricant for life.

, Pay attention to how your dog functions in low lighting. If you see her unsure of or bumping into her surroundings, she may be having trouble seeing in the dark. Night blindness is a sign of Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA).PRA isn't painful so you won't see your pug rubbing her eyes, squinting, or tearing up. Instead, you'll see a gradual worsening of her vision during the day which could develop into complete blindness.

, Some pug owners say that they noticed their pug's eyes were shiny because of PRA. Another sign of PRA is abnormal pupil reactions or dilation. Your dog's pupils may always appear dilated because his eyes are trying to let in more light to compensate for his lack of vision.You can try shining a light in your pug's eyes to see how his eyes react. Normally, his pupils should become smaller as you shine the light and they should get larger when you remove the light.

, The vet will take a full family history of your dog's health. Since PRA is an inherited disease, it's important to find if your dog is genetically predisposed to developing the disease. The vet will also examine the inside of your dog's eye using a slit lamp to check for any abnormalities with the retinas.The vet will also do blood work and test your pug's urine to check for any other conditions.

, Unfortunately, there are no medications or surgeries to treat PRA. You may be able slow down the loss of vision by improving your dog's diet (if the PRA was caused by a metabolic condition). Otherwise, you'll need to watch out for your pug to make sure she's safe from injury or attack. Take her to the vet for regular eye examinations which could detect cataracts or glaucoma that develop. Remember, your dog isn't in pain.To modify your dog's diet, change your pug's diet to a low-fat omnivorous diet (includes meat).
If your pug has PRA, avoid breeding her since the disease is genetically spread.

, Look for squinting, thick eye discharge, watering, or eye redness. Your pug may act like he's in pain. This is because your dog's cornea is large and can easily become scratched or injured. This kind of trauma can cause ulcers that may become infected.To treat ulcers, the vet will examine the eye and test for infection. Depending on the cause of the ulcer, your pug may need surgery, topical medications, or contact lenses (instead of surgery).

, EKS shares many of the same signs as corneal ulcers. Your dog will appear to be in pain, may rub her eye with her paws, have more tears, and red eyes. If your dog has EKS, she won't be able to fully close her eyes (even when she sleeps). This can cause damage to the cornea since it will dry out.To treat EKS, your veterinarian will probably recommend surgery to improve the eyelid. In the meantime, your pug will probably need lubricating drops to prevent damage to the cornea.

, Again, your dog's eyes might seem red, irritated, watery, or you may see a thick discharge. Your pug may appear bothered by something in his eye. He may have distichiasis, a condition where eyelashes grow in gland ducts of the eye where normally eyelashes don’t grow. The eyelashes can scratch and irritate the eyeball.Your vet may treat distichiasis by surgically destroying the hair follicles so the eyelashes can't grow back. If your dog only has minor irritation, the vet can recommend an eye ointment to keep the eye lubricated.

, If you look at your pug's eye and see abnormal brown spots or a grayish haze covering the cornea, she may have a type of keratitis. Trauma to the eye can cause pigmentary keratitis which makes the brown spots. Pannus or chronic superficial keratitis can cause the grayish haze when blood vessels and tissue grows on the eye. Pannus keratitis is an immune response that causes eye inflammation.Since keratitis can cause loss of vision, it's important to get medical treatment. To treat keratitis, your pug will probably need topical steroids or anti-inflammatory eye drops for the rest of her life.

, If your pug experiences trauma around the head or too much pressure is placed on the neck, his eyes may literally bulge out of the sockets. If you see this, get emergency veterinary treatment since it's painful. The veterinarian may try to lubricate the eye and gently push it back into place while your dog is under anesthesia. Or, the veterinarian may recommend surgically removing the eye.Never grab a pug around the neck or you may cause proptosis. Use a harness instead of a collar when walking your pug.

, Check your pug every day for any signs of eye problems. If you notice anything unusual or have any questions about a potential eye problem, contact your veterinarian as soon as possible. Early eye treatment could prevent serious damage to the eye.


Follow through with the veterinarian's orders. This means giving all medications as prescribed by your veterinarian. Do not discontinue a medication without consulting your veterinarian.

Provide the right food for your pug.,
Limit the amount of treats and food you give to your pug.,
Know that many pugs suffer from flatulence.",How to Live with a Pug Dog1," Feed a good quality food. Look at the label and seek out a food that lists a named meat as top of the ingredient list. Avoid foods that are high in cereal or soya. Not only is this an indication of a less good quality food, but these ingredients ferment and can add to your pug's flatulence problems. , Pugs are greedy and those big eyes will try to convince you that its still hungry. Pugs easily become overweight if fed too much, so learn how to body condition score your pug so that you closely monitor any slight weight gain so that you can cut his rations and lose the weight before it builds up into a big problem.


That said, pugs love to eat just about anything, so try giving it fresh vegetables for training treats, which keeps it motivated and healthy.
Keep your pug’s food in dog proof containers and out reach. Otherwise your pug may break into the food container and gorge itself on the contents.
It is especially important to keep your pug at a lean weight because of their breathing problems. Carrying extra weight puts extra demands on their body for oxygen, and extra body fat compresses the lungs, airway, and throat, which adds to his problems pulling in air., It is common for pug dogs to have more problems with gas because of their breathing problems. In their struggle to breath, pugs often inhale air down into their stomach and gut. This gas then passes through the digestive tract and it is vented as flatulence.Try placing air fresheners around your house or keeping a room spray at the ready to get rid of any unpleasant smells caused by your pug’s flatulence.

Help your dog cope.",How to Treat Glaucoma in Poodles," You may first notice that one eye looks different than the other. The white of one eye might look red with inflamed blood vessels crossing over the surface of the eye. The cornea that is normally clear may look blue or milky since the cells can swell from glaucoma. Your poodle's pupil may look dilated or larger than usual.One eye can even look physically bigger than the other because of all of the swelling.;
, While the eyes might signal that something is obviously wrong with your dog's eyes, his behavior may be another sign that he has glaucoma. Glaucoma is a very painful condition so your dog might be depressed, quiet, or even irritable. Look for these changes in behavior:Rubs at his head
Tries to protect the painful eye
Snaps if you get close to the eye or that side of the face
Rubs the eye against furniture

, If your poodle has any signs of glaucoma, take him to the veterinarian immediately. The vet will do a thorough exam and measure the pressure within the eyes using specialized equipment. Try to keep your poodle relaxed during the exam since stress can increase the pressure in the eye.Your vet may refer you to a veterinary ophthalmologist or specialist to confirm the diagnosis and recommend treatment.

, If the vet determines that your poodle's eye isn't draining away fluid correctly, the vet will diagnose your dog with glaucoma. The vet will then decide whether or not your poodle has primary or secondary glaucoma. Primary glaucoma is caused a physical abnormality in the eye while secondary glaucoma is caused by disease or injury to the eye.Some dog breeds are more likely than others to suffer from glaucoma. These include the poodle, beagle, great dane, dalmatian, and spaniels.

, If your poodle has severe glaucoma, your dog might need medications delivered intravenously. Medications like mannitol can reduce the pressure in the eye by drawing out fluid. It will take about 30 minutes for the mannitol to reduce pressure. The medication is effective for 6 to 10 hours.Since mannitol can raise blood sugar, your dog shouldn't take it if he has diabetes.

, Once dangerous eye pressure is reduced, you'll need to manage your poodle's glaucoma. Your veterinarian may recommend using eye drops that contain prostaglandin analogues. You'll need to apply the drops 1 to 3 times a day so they can improve the drainage of fluid from the eyes. The veterinarian may also prescribe:Beta blockers (like timolol) that improve the outflow of fluid from the eye.
Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (like dorzolamide 2% or brinzolamide 1%) which reduces the production of fluid in the eye.

, Because glaucoma is a painful condition, your poodle might need to take a painkiller, like an oral medication from the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) group. Ask your vet to recommend dosing for aspirin or ibuprofen.If your poodle's eyes seem red or inflamed, the veterinarian may prescribe corticosteroids to reduce inflammation.

, Most dogs with glaucoma will need surgery in order to save the vision (or slow down vision loss) in at least one eye. During the initial exam, the vet will determine which eye has better vision and whether or not your poodle has already lost sight in one eye. A specialist can perform different types of surgeries depending on if your poodle can still see. Types of surgeries include:Creating drainage from the eye by way of a small drain or stent
Using a laser to destroy cells that make excess fluid in the eye
Freezing the cells that create excess fluid
Replacing the lens to get to cells that make excess fluid

, Take your poodle to the vet every 6 months so that his eyes can be checked for increased pressure or loss of vision. Most dogs diagnosed with glaucoma in one eye will develop it in the other eye within a few months to 2 years after treatment.Don't hesitate to contact your vet if you notice anything strange with your poodle's eyes.

, In addition to giving your poodle pain medication, you may need to help your dog adapt to glaucoma treatments. If your poodle has had surgery to remove an eye, your dog will actually adapt quickly and only lose a little of his depth perception. While he's adjusting to his changing sight, make your house safe for him. Clear large or sharp-edged objects out of his way and guide him around the house following his surgery.Pay close attention to your dog when he's outside and off-leash since it will take some time for him to adjust.
Your dog's temperament may improve since he's no longer in pain from the glaucoma.

Be on the look out for dry eyes.,
Identify the signs of developing cherry eye.,
Spot the signs of pigmentary keratopathy.,
Pay attention to the general signs of eye problems.,
Take your dog to the vet.,
Approve additional testing.,
Follow the vet's suggestions for treatment.",How to Diagnose Eye Problems in Pugs," The cornea is the transparent layer on the front part of the eye. In order to see, light needs to pass through it to reach the lens and the retina. If a dog has corneal ulcers, which is like a divot in the cornea, they will affect the ability of light to pass through the cornea, inhibiting the vision of the dog.Signs include your pug holding its eye closed or squinting a lot. This is a sign that your dog is having discomfort and may need veterinary treatment.
You may also notice a lack of shine in the part of the eye with the ulcer, or jagged reflections instead of a reflection with smooth edges.
In the pug, the ulcer develops because of the large amount of cornea that is exposed to the air, making it more prone to drying and trauma.This means that ulcers are caused by a combination of genetics and injury.;
, Pugs are prone to hereditary forms of lens cataracts. The lens is the structure which focuses light on the retina. It is a transparent sack of jelly and sits just behind the colored part of the eye, the iris. A cataract refers to a cloudiness of the lens. This genetic condition can develop in a pug anytime between 6 months and 6 years old.You may see signs of this as a whiteness or milkiness behind the iris (the colored part of the eye) which is normally black (the pupil).
You may also notice the general behavior associated with a dog going blind, for example it is bumping into items in the home that it previously easily avoided.

, The lack of tear fluid production causes the surface of the eye to be too dry. This makes the eye uncomfortable, hot, and itchy. The surface of the eye loses its shine and appears dull. The dog may rub its head to relieve the itch and damages the cornea while itching. To protect itself, the eye produces a tacky, mucus like substance that has the effect of gumming up the eye.


A dog with dry eye may squint, holding the eye closed because it's more comfortable that way.Dry eyes occur when the tear ducts either do not produce enough moisture or the moisture gets blocked from making it to the eye. This could be either genetic, meaning a poorly-formed tear duct, or by condition, such as a clogged tear duct.

, Cherry eye is a condition that occurs when the gland behind the third eyelid (in the inner corner of the eye) pops out from its position behind the third eyelid. It sticks forward, looking like a small red cherry stuck on the eye.


Diagnosing cherry eye is not difficult, as it can even be seen across the room because of the big red area in the dog's eye.Cherry eye is caused by a genetic condition that weakens the connection between the gland and the eye, allowing the gland to easily pop out of position. It is not known if it is an inherited condition, even though it is a congenital condition.Although this condition may look painful, it usually is not for the dog., Pigmentary keratopathy is a hereditary condition that is not yet fully understood. Brown pigment is deposited in the clear cells of the cornea, which is like wearing a contact lens covered in paint. The dog cannot see through it and eventually loses its vision.If you are suspicious that your pug is losing its sight, for instance it is running into objects that it should be able to avoid, inspect its eye. Look carefully at the surface of the eye for deposits of brown pigments. These can range in size from small speckles to large patches.

, Don't concern yourself with making a definite diagnosis. Your job is to recognize that something isn't quite right and then to make the judgement as to whether or not your dog needs to go to a vet. In the case of eye problems, it is probably better to be safe than sorry, as many eye conditions that are left untreated could lead to blindness and pain for your dog. Signs there is a problem include:Holding the eye closed or squinting: This is a sign of discomfort and requires urgent attention.
Rubbing the eye: Again, an important sign the dog's eye is uncomfortable.
A discharge from the eye: This can be watery is the eye is irritated, green if there is infection, or a tacky glue like discharge for dry eye.
A dull eye: A dull eye can indicate an ulcer on the surface, or a lack of moisture production.

, You should feel free to call and consult with your veterinary office if you are unsure whether you should bring your pug in or not. If you do bring the dog in, the vet will conduct a physical examination. He or she will pay particular attention to the eyes, the area around the eyes, the eyelids (checking for cherry eye) and the inside of the eye.


The vet will look for external factors that may be irritating the eye, such as hairs that are touching the eye.
The vet will inspect the surface of the cornea, looking for pigment deposits (pigmentary keratitis) or dullness (dry eye or ulcers), which could show there is a problem.
The vet will then uses an ophthalmoscope (a light and magnifier) to look closely at the surface of the eye, the front chamber, the back chamber, and the retina.This will give him or her the most information about the possibility of a cataract because the the retina will be difficult or impossible to see due to a cataract.

, The vet may need to verify his or her diagnosis through additional testing. This may end of costing you a little bit more money but is in important that the vet is confident in his or her diagnosis so that the right treatment can be prescribed.


To check for ulcers, the vet puts a special optic dye, called fluorescein, into the eye. This dye is orange, and when it comes in contact with damaged tissue it turns green. An ulcer shows up as a vivid green area on the surface of the orange cornea. This confirms that a corneal ulcer is present.
To check for dry eye, the vet performs a Schirmer tear test.This means hooking a narrow strip of special blotting paper marked out in millimetres, over the lower eyelid. The paper soaks up the tears and travels along the paper. A normal eye travels 10-15 mm in one minute. A pug is considered to have dry eye if it fails to reach 5mm after one minute.
To double check for a cataract, the vet may need to dilate your pug's eyes.The vet will stand back in a darkened room and shine a bright light directly into each eye. The opaque lens blocks light from casting a dark shadow on the retina. This confirms that a cataract is present.

, Depending on the eye condition your pug has, the treatment will vary immensely. Discuss all treatment options with your veterinarian and be sure to pick the one that is best for both you and your pug. This sometimes means that you cannot pay for the most expensive surgery or advanced treatment but you can make sure your dog is not in pain or discomfort.


For corneal ulcers, the treatment generally includes antibiotics or antiproteinase (topical treatment). This will generally clear up the condition if the ulcers are not very, very advanced before treatment is sought. If corneal ulcers are caught very late, the treatment usually includes surgery to repair the corneas and the iris, which can be affected if the condition is serious.For cherry eye, the condition usually requires surgery to replace the gland associated with the third eyelid. This gland is important, as it produces the fluid needed for tear production.Dry eyes are usually treated by administering artificial tears or lubricants on a regular basis. This is done at home by you, not by your veterinarian.Cataract treatment usually entails surgery. The surgeon cuts open the front of the eye, takes out the cloudy lens, and replaces it with an artificial lens. This surgery should be done as quickly as possible, as the illness is progressive.Pigmentary keratopathy is usually treated with medications to reduce pigmentation, medications to produce tears, or surgery on the eyelids."

Inspect your Pug’s wrinkles daily.,
Clean each fold.,
Dry each fold.",How to Groom Pugs1," You want to keep the folds of skin on your Pug’s face clean of debris and dry to avoid the risk of infection and prevent smells. Inspect the folds each day to make sure there is no debris or irritation present. Use your fingers to gently separate each fold around your dog’s eyes, nose, and mouth, inspecting each one thoroughly., Clean each wrinkle as you go, even if there is no debris present. Use a canine face or eye wipe to gently wipe the skin in between each fold. Gently swipe the wipe along the fold in one motion. Continue this process until the wipe comes out clean with no dirt or debris on it.


Canine wipes are the best cleanser to use on your dog’s wrinkles, but you can also use a soft wash cloth, cotton balls, or q-tips to clean the folds. If you are using one of these options, moisten the object with a 50/50 mixture of high-quality canine shampoo and water first.
Clean your dog’s wrinkles at least once a day. Doing so several times a day—particularly after your dog eats—is even better for keeping the folds clean.
Keep an eye on any areas you notice are infected or have a strong odor. If these areas do not improve after a day or two, make an appointment with your vet., Once you are satisfied that you have gotten all of the dirt and debris out of your dog’s folds, it’s time to dry them. Leaving moisture in the folds can increase the risk of infection. Run a soft, clean, thin washcloth along the fold until you’ve removed all moisture from the area."

Expect some training challenges.,
Set house rules and stick to them.,
Be patient when house training your pug.",How to Live with a Pug Dog2," Pugs can be difficult to train. This is because they are strong willed rather than stupid. In fact, you could say they are highly intelligent because they work out what they want and then go ahead and do it regardless of your opinion. This does not mean you should give up on training, but just be extra patient and be prepared to put in the hours.Thoroughly acquaint yourself with recommended training techniques such as reward-based training. Getting you pug onside with rewards and then getting him to work for those rewards is what will crack the training in the end.

, If your pug isn't allowed on the furniture, make sure every member of the family applies this rule under all circumstances, even on the weekend. A pug given inconsistent instruction will select the version it prefers and inconsistency will make the training even harder.

, Pugs have a reputation for taking longer than other breeds to be housetrained. Crate training and using positive reinforcement may help you to housetrain your pug a bit faster.

Give your pug regular, mild exercise.,
Play with your pug.,
Plan to spend lots of time with your pug.,
Take your pug to the veterinarian for regular check-ups.,
Brush your pug every day.,
Keep your pet clean in its nooks and crannies.",How to Live with a Pug Dog3," Because of their breathing difficulties, pugs do much better going for long walks at a steady walking pace so they don't get too out of breath. They are not equipped for prolonged energetic exercise, such as prolonged sessions of chase with other dogs where they don't get to stop and catch their breath. This doesn't mean you shouldn't throw a ball or let your pug play fetch, but be vigilant and if it is struggling then pause between throws to let it catch its breath.
Pugs are also extrovert dogs who need to get out and about, so they can be nosy and see what's going on and with whom.

, Let your pug chase you around the house as you weave through the furniture and around corners. Stop suddenly and start chasing it around just as it was chasing you. A good old fashion game of tag will never let a pug down.


Make play dates often for your pug to romp with other dogs. They forget that creatures other than you exist out there and need extra socialization.

, Pugs are bred to be companions, which also means that they like company and will want to be with you most of the time. They can be clingy and follow you around like a shadow, so be prepared for that kind of attention.


If you have a pug puppy then you may want to crate train it so that it has a den where it is happy to spend some time by itself. Spend time in a different room so that from a young age the pug accepts not always being able to see you., Taking your pug to the vet for regular check-ups can help to ensure that it will live a long, happy life. Make sure that your pug is registered with a vet and has regular health check-ups to keep it healthy. Only your vet can make sure that your pug is up to date with preventative measures, such as vaccinations and parasite control.


Pugs are also popular targets for dog thieves, so consider having a microchip fitted in your pug as a permanent means of identification and to prove ownership.
You may also want to consider taking out pet health insurance for your pug. Pet insurance is a good idea for a pug because they suffer from breathing problems, which may require emergency stabilization and even surgery., Pugs are short-haired, but they still require regular brushing to get rid of dead hair. Pugs are known to shed a lot of hair, so you will need to brush your pug every day to prevent hair from ending up on your floors and furniture. Invest in a good brush and make brushing your pug a part of your daily routine to help keep his shedding under control.Invest in lint rollers, a good vacuum cleaner, leather or faux leather furniture, hardwood or linoleum flooring, light or dark-colored clothes (depending on the color of your pug), a bathtub mesh hat that fits over the drain, and a good dog brush.

, You know how you have to clean a baby's crevices and folds with soft cloths and Q-Tips? Get to know your pug's folds and crevices. You'll be cleaning the pug's face folds a lot.

Brush your Pug weekly.,
Trim your Pug’s nails.,
Introduce tooth brushing.,
Brush its teeth regularly.,
Clean the wax and dirt from its ears.,
Clean its eyes.",How to Groom Pugs2," Pugs are heavy shedders, despite their short hair. Brushing your Pug on a regular basis will help cut down on its shedding and minimize the amount of hair in your home. You should brush your dog with a rubber brush or one with stainless steel bristles at least once a week. Brush your Pug in the direction its hair grows without applying much extra pressure on the brush.If your Pug is still shedding quite a bit with weekly brushings, try brushing it every day.
Brushing your Pug both before and after you bathe it will also help cut down on shedding. Bathing will loosen up the hairs in your dog’s coat, so brushing it after its bath will help catch many of these loose hairs., Pugs’ nails grow extremely fast. You should trim your dog’s nails every two weeks to make sure they do not get too long. To do so, use a small nail clipper or nail grinder and clip only the curved part of the nail. Watch out for the quick, which is the vein running through your dog’s foot. Be careful not to cut this vein when you are clipping your dog’s nails.


A good time to cut your dog’s nails is when they are in a deep sleep at night. Even if your Pug wakes up while you are trimming its nails, it will probably be too drowsy to put up a struggle.
If you accidentally clip the quick while trimming your dog’s nails, apply some styptic powder to the cut to help stop the bleeding and prevent infection.Depending on the types of surfaces your dog encounters on a regular basis, you may only need to clip its nails every three to six months. Walking on hard outdoor surfaces frequently may help keep the nails filed down. You should still check its nails every few weeks to make sure they’re not getting too long, however., Taking good care of your Pug’s teeth is also important. You should introduce your Pug to tooth brushing early on in its life. Use the following strategy to get your dog used to having its teeth brushed:


Use your finger to rub your dog’s teeth every day for a week. Do your best to touch all of the teeth. Say the words “teeth” or “brush” while you do this so your dog will begin to associate these key words with getting its teeth brushed. Praise your dog when it sits still for this and offer it a small, healthy treat at the end of each session.
For the following week, use a canine finger tooth brush or a small breed toothbrush to go over the teeth. Wet the brush, but don’t apply toothpaste. Remember to say the key word while you are doing this.
At the end of the week you can start using a toothbrush with toothpaste on it., It is recommended you spend three to four minutes brushing your dog’s teeth every day. You want to make sure you cover the front, back, and sides of all teeth. Make sure you’re cleaning all the surfaces of the teeth and invest in a quality canine toothpaste, as human toothpastes can be toxic to dogs if they are swallowed. Keep using the key word when you brush your dog’s teeth.


It might help to set a timer for three or four minutes while you are brushing so you know you are spending enough time on this., Using a damp cotton ball, clean your dog's ears every one to two weeks. Move the cotton ball around the inside of the ear, making sure to get any wax, dirt, or debris that are present. Don’t go too far into the ear, as you do not want to hit your dog’s ear drum.


If you notice any puss, excessive liquid wax, or irritated areas in your dog’s ears, take it to the vet. These symptoms can indicate an infection of some kind., Because of the shape of a Pug’s head, its eyes bulge, and therefore are more susceptible to injury and scratches. Cleaning your dog’s eyes properly can help prevent it from developing eye problems. You should clean your dog’s eyes daily with a baby wipe, moistened cotton ball, or canine eye wipes. Do this several times a day—usually first thing in the morning, after your dog eats, and before bed. Wipe away any crusty build-up with the wipe, being careful not to get any cleaning solution into your dog’s eyes. If you notice debris on your dog’s eyeball, use the following steps to remove it:


Use your fingers to gently push the top and bottom eye lids open.
Squeeze four to five drops of a sterile canine eye cleaning solution into the cup of the lower lid.
Then, let go of your Pug and allow him to blink. This should discharge any debris in the eye.
Wipe your dog’s face with a clean wipe after cleaning out the eye to keep any leftover debris away from its face."

Fill your tub with about three inches of water.,
Wet your Pug’s coat.,
Apply shampoo to your dog’s coat.,
Wipe your dog’s folds with a wash cloth.,
Rinse well.,
Apply conditioner to your dog’s coat.,
Rinse well.,
Dry your dog with a towel.",How to Groom Pugs3," Pugs need bathed approximately every three weeks. To start, fill your bathtub, laundry tub, or another basin with about three inches (7.6 cm) of warm water. Use the inside of your wrist to check the water temperature before you begin, as water that is too hot can irritate your dog’s skin.


Running water can make Pugs somewhat skittish, so fill the tub or basin before putting your dog in it.
If the tub or basin you’re using is slippery, place a non-slip mat on the bottom of it to keep your Pug from sliding around., After placing your Pug in the bath tub, use a hose attachment or bucket to saturate its coat with water. This will help the shampoo lather more easily.

, Once the fur is saturated, apply dog shampoo to your Pug’s coat and lather well. Use your hands and fingers to gently scrub your dog’s skin, making sure to get its belly, legs, genitals, and tail.


Use your fingers to work shampoo into the fur on your dog’s head and face, making sure to clean inside the folds around its mouth and nose. Be careful not to get shampoo into its eyes, nose, or ears.
Use only dog shampoo, as human shampoo can be too harsh for a Pug., Take a soft wash cloth and gently wipe the folds around your dog’s nose and mouth. You may need to lift the top of the fold with your hand in order to access the skin underneath the fold., When you are done lathering the shampoo and scrubbing your dog’s skin, rinse the shampoo out of it well. Shampoo that is left on the skin can be drying, so make sure you get it all out. Use your hands and fingers to work the shampoo down your dog’s body and out of its coat., After rinsing, apply a dog conditioner to your pet’s coat. Using shampoo alone can be too drying, so applying conditioner will help keep your dog’s skin moisturized and prevent hair breakage. Work the conditioner into your dog’s coat, making sure you get it down to the skin., Once the conditioner is worked in, rinse your dog’s coat well, using your hands and fingers to massage the skin to help get all of the conditioner out., Once all of the shampoo and conditioner is rinsed out of your dog’s coat, use an absorbent towel to pat your Pug dry. Try to avoid rubbing with the towel, as this can irritate your dog’s skin. A Pug’s coat can hold quite a bit of water, so you may need to go over the coat several times with the towel before all the excess water is removed.Keep a couple towels handy in case you need to switch to a dry towel to get the rest of the water from your Pug’s coat.

Be aware that pugs are prone to breathing problems.,
Learn to spot signs of respiratory distress.,
Take immediate action if your pug shows signs of respiratory distress.,
Keep your pug out of hot weather.,
Keep your pug at a healthy weight.",How to Live with a Pug Dog4," Pugs are more prone to breathing difficulties because they have a narrower windpipe than most dogs. They also have narrow nostrils and a long soft palate, which takes up lots of room at the back of their throats. In fact, pugs snore and are noisy breathers because of the amount of soft tissue at the back of the throat. This tissue vibrates whenever a pug takes a breath.If your pug’s snoring bothers you, consider wearing earplugs at night to block out the sound or train your pug to sleep in his crate.

, With mild exertion many pugs pant heavily in order to satisfy their body's need for oxygen. Be aware that if you persist in exercising your pug once it shows signs of shortness of breath it could collapse. Most of the time, you do not need to worry about your pug’s noisy breathing. However, you should learn to recognize the signs of respiratory distress in case your pug has a problem. These signs include:Noisy breathing with a panicky facial expression
Blue gums or tongue
Thick sticky saliva
Reluctance to move
Exaggerated movements of the chest and abdomen
Restlessness as if unable to get comfortable
Collapse

, Make sure the pug is cool and stop all activity. If the pug doesn't improve in a few minutes, contact a vet as an emergency.


Keep calm as the dog will pick up on your panic and this will panic it.
If your pug regularly struggles with its breathing consider consulting with your veterinarian about corrective surgery. There are operations that trim back the excessive amount of tissue at the back of the throat, and also an operation to widen the nostrils so it easier for a pug to breath in.

, Dogs can't sweat and so to loose heat they pant. In hot weather, pugs are doubly compromised because they can have difficulty breathing at the best of times and then add in the extra need to cool down, which they are unable to do, and they are liable to get heatstroke.To avoid this, never exercise your pug on a hot day. Make sure it stays in the shade or in a cool room.
If your pug starts to pant excessively, dampen its coat with water to cool it, and dampen its tongue to keep it comfortable as it quickly dries out.
Sit the pug in front of a fan on a low blow setting. Also make sure the pug has water available at all times.

, It is important to keep your pug at a lean weight because of the breathing problems associated with the breed. Carrying extra weight puts extra demands on your pug’s body for oxygen, and extra body fat compresses the lungs, airway, and throat, which adds to his problems pulling in air.Talk to your veterinarian if think your pug is overweight to get recommendations for a healthy weight reduction feeding plan for your pug.

These symptoms often wax and wane, which can make it hard to diagnose.It most cases, the adrenal glands gradually fail, as a result of attack from the poodle's own immune system.;
, The initial symptoms can persist in a mild form for a few months.However, if the problem is not identified, eventually the levels of hormones are so low that the dog collapses, in what is known as an Addisonian crisis.


These are potentially fatal and need emergency medical treatment if the dog is to live.
During an Addisonian crisis, the dog collapses, repeatedly vomits, and goes into circulatory shock with a slow heartbeat. The paws are likely to feel cold, the animal is extremely weak and this is likely to be fatal unless treated promptly.

, Addison's disease is more common in female than male dogs, with the ratio being 2:1. Age also seems to be a risk factor, with young to middle-aged female dogs seeming the most likely to suffer from Addison's.Several dogs breeds seem to be more likely to suffer from Addison's disease than others. This includes the poodle, rottweiler, bearded collie, and the west highland white terrier., Addison's disease is also known as hypoadrenocorticism. It is a condition where the adrenal glands (two small glands that sit just in front of each kidney in the abdomen) fail to produce enough of the natural steroids, called corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids.


These are crucial chemicals for the normal functioning of the body as they help the dog to cope with stress, and also regulate the levels of certain crucial minerals and salts in the body.

, The symptoms of weakness, poor appetite and frequent tummy upsets are quite nonspecific and can be confused with infections, pancreatitis, or even a foreign body. The vet may run a screening blood test and identify changes in the balance of minerals and salts in the blood that are suggestive of Addison's disease.

, This can increase the cost of the visit, but may be necessary. To pin down the diagnosis requires a blood test called an ACTH stimulation test.This test consists of an injection of a substance that stimulates the adrenal glands and a repeat blood sample taken one hour later. If the adrenal gland does not respond by producing more hormone, than Addison's is confirmed.
In some cases, it is also necessary to eliminate other problems, such as ruling out back pain as a cause of weakness, an ECG for heart disease, or imaging the abdomen to rule out a foreign body.

, Addison's is treated by supplementing the missing hormones. However, if the dog is in an Addisonian crisis, then it needs emergency stabilization. This includes intravenous fluids, along with intravenous corticosteroids.


Treatment may also include an injection of a new drug called DOCP (Percorten V), which is a synthetic mineralocorticoid.In addition the dog will need to be kept warm, and turned regularly so that she doesn't get bed sores.

, The aim of treatment is to replace the missing hormones, which help the dog to cope with stress and regulate its blood salt and mineral levels. All cases of Addison's disease need to take mineralocorticoids in the long term. Traditionally, there was only one treatment available, which is a tablet fludrocortisone (Florinef), which is given daily.However, a new synthetic mineralocorticoid, called DOCP (Percorten V), is given by long-acting injection is now available.


The salt levels in the blood are checked every week to two weeks and the dose increased incrementally until sodium and chloride levels are within normal. After that the blood levels need to be monitored regularly, such as every 2 - 3 months.
Florinef has mixed activity, which means it supports both mineralocorticoid and corticosteroid levels, which means in some cases additional corticosteroid tablets are not necessary.
The vet gives DOCP by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection once every 25 - 30 days.It should be noted that DOCP has no corticosteroid action and so supplementation with corticosteroids, such as prednisolone, is essential. At the start of treatment the patient's kidney and salt levels should be monitored every 2 weeks, and adjustments to the dose of DOCP made. Once stable, these can be checked every 3 - 6 months.

, Dogs taking the mineralocorticoid DOCP, it will also need to take a corticosteroid. However, once stabilized, some dogs that are taking Florinef can stop taking corticosteroids regularly.


However, the owner needs to keep a supply on hand to give at times of stress (such as going to the dog grooming parlor or the kennel).Other dogs need to stay on corticosteroids in the long term. The vet will make a judgement call based on the dog's demeanor at home (a good appetite, energetic, lack of shaking) and the results of blood tests.

, Some dogs with Addison's disease do struggle to maintain the salt levels in their blood. For these patients, the vet may suggest sprinkling table salt over the dog's food to supplement their salt levels.

, Once diagnosed and stabilized, the long-term outlook for Addison's patients is excellent.However, stressful situations always increase the dog's need for steroids, so the owner should be aware and keep extra tablets on hand.


Give your dog steroids if it shows signs of trembling or weakness, or it vomits. This could indicate destabilization.

Your vet will be able to check for common pug health complications and recommend a regular check-up schedule.Younger pugs may need to see the vet more often until they are spayed or neutered and have completed their first course of shots. After that, a healthy pug should get a checkup every six months.
Your vet will also help you work out a preventative care schedule for things like annual shots and teeth cleanings, both of which are important parts of keeping your pug healthy;
, Regardless of whether you bring home a pug puppy or an older rescue, enrolling in a training class is an important part of introducing your pug to your home. This will help both of you learn a shared set of commands and provide a designated time each week for the two of you to bond.Pugs, especially young pugs, are energetic and eager to please. Enrolling in training will help them learn how to channel that energy into constructive behaviors and help you learn how to manage destructive tendencies.

, Pugs require attention, but should also have a space of their own in which they feel comfortable when you are not home or are otherwise occupied. Provide your pug with an area of its own including a bed and blankets, some toys, and easy access to food and fresh water.Consider putting the space in the corner of a well-used area in your home. This way, even if you cannot pay attention to your pug for a moment, they do not feel alone.
Remember that pugs are sensitive to very hot temperatures and rapid temperature changes, so avoid setting up their space in areas with continued direct sunlight or near heating and cooling vents.

, Pugs love to eat, so it’s easy for them to become overweight. You need to monitor their diet closely to ensure proper portion control. Choose a quality small-bite dry food appropriate for your pug’s age, and feed them consistently once or twice a day according to the manufacturer's serving size recommendations.Remember that food packaging indicated the maximum your pug should eat for a day. If you feed your pug twice a day, divide the maximum serving in half to get the proper meal size.
If you follow the manufacturer's portion size suggestions and notice your pug gaining unhealthy weight, talk to your vet. They can help you modify meal sizes or switch to a more appropriate food for your dog.

, Treats can be an important part of training, as well as a way to reward your pug for good behavior. Remember to factor their treats into their daily diet, though. Too many treats could cause unhealthy weight gain, which could cause or exacerbate respiratory and joint problems.Stick to small treats with your pug, such as training treats. Treats meant for larger dogs should be broken or cut into pieces.
Try to use treats consistently for one or two behaviors, such as after a walk or a bathroom break. Avoid giving your pug extra treats outside of these times.

, Pugs are active, but often in short bursts, since their facial folds make it hard for them to cool down when running and playing. Help your pug exercise by offering one or two moderate walks during the day, along with periods of playtime such as playing fetch, tug-of-war, or chase in the home or in your yard.Avoid relying on a collar while walking your pug, as this could limit breathing. Attach their leash to a harness, instead.Ideally, a healthy adult pug should get two 15-20 minute walks a day, along with smaller play times with toys throughout the day. If your pug has health problems, walks may need to be shorter.
In warm areas or seasons, adjust your walks so that your pug isn’t out during the hottest part of the day. In cold climates or seasons, consider getting your pug a coat for outside time. Avoid walks during very windy or excessively rainy days, as these can cause eye problems.

, Pugs are prone to nervousness and anxiety. You can help them calm down by being consistent in your daily routine. This means scheduling feeding times, walks, play times, and quiet times as close to the same time every day as possible.Your personal schedule may change, but it is important to you try to keep your pug’s schedule the same. Ask a friend or neighbor to help you out with feeding and walks on nights you know you’ll be home late.

, Your pug’s facial folds can hold onto food, saliva, dirt, and other debris that may be smelly and irritating to your pug. Use a cotton swab dipped in warm water and run it along the folds around your dog’s nose and eyes, being careful to not let the swab make contact with their eyes, nostrils, or mouth.Don’t leave the folds damp as this could cause further irritation. Dry them with a towel or a dry cotton swab.
While this is recommended as a once-weekly routine, you can do it as often as necessary if you notice your pug starting to smell.

, Pugs shed, there is no way to avoid it. You can help keep their coat healthy and their hair off of everything you own, though, by brushing them once or twice a week with a slicker brush or a specialty shedding brush., Those cute little pug ears are just the right shape to trap dirt and debris, so they should be cleaned regularly with a cleaning solution meant especially for dog’s ears. Squirt the ears with the solution, then wipe the inside down with a cotton ball.Do not push the cotton balls into the ear canal or use cotton swabs, as this could damage the ear. In you notice deep wax blockages, talk to your vet.

, Regardless of whether your pug is dirty or smelly, a once-monthly bath is recommended. Be sure the bath is shallow enough for your pug to stand, and use a shampoo formulated for dogs, which is available from most local pet stores.Make sure to rinse your pug thoroughly after shampooing them. Their folds will hold onto soap, so check carefully to make sure your pug is completely rinsed. Be sure to cover their sensitive eyes while you rinse, them, too.

, Pugs don’t wear down their nails the same way some more active dogs do, so regular nail trims are important. You can take your pug to a groomer or your vet for a nail trim. If you decide to trim at home, make sure to use clippers meant for dog nails to avoid cracking and splitting, and always cut below the soft center of the nail, called the quick.

Injury to the quick can be very painful for your pug. If you cannot see the quick because your pug’s nails are dark or opaque, it is best to have a professional trim your their nails instead."

You will need to be gentle, yet firm and consistent when training your Pom so he knows you are in charge.Poorly-trained Poms can end up developing what’s called the ‘Small Dog Syndrome’—the dog believes he is the leader of the pack. This syndrome can lead to serious behavioral problems.Without proper training, your little Pom could end up running the household and turning into a tiny terror.;
, If your Pom is a puppy, you should start training him as soon as you can.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten will teach him basic socialization skills that will help him mature into a well-rounded dog.In addition to puppy kindergarten class, socialize your puppy Pom by exposing him to different people, sights and sounds.This will get him comfortable with his new environment and teach him how to act properly in different situations.
As your Pom grows older, enroll him in an obedience training class to teach him to follow basic commands, such as 'sit' and 'stay.'


, If you have a puppy, it will be critical to housetrain him. Potty training can take up to several months, so be patient with your puppy as he learns the proper place to relieve himself. It is best to train your puppy to go outside, and to let him choose his own spot to go. To get your puppy on a consistent routine of going outside to relieve himself, take him outside after certain activities, such as 20 minutes after eating and 20 minutes before bedtime.Although it may be tempting to do indoor housetraining on pee pads or newspaper, it can be challenging, since your Pom may not like being forced to use a pee pad in a spot he didn't choose himself.If you and your family members are gone for long periods of time (more than eight hours), it may be more practical for you to leave an indoor area for your Pom that contains a pee pad and a few other creature comforts (bed, food and water bowls, toys).Remember, though, that your Pom may relieve himself in a place other than the pee pad.
A good rule of thumb to remember is that a puppy can hold off from going to the bathroom for one hour per pound of body weight. For example, if your puppy is two pounds, he can hold it for about two hours., Crate training is a great method to train your puppy Pom. The crate not only keeps him safe from potential dangers, but can also keep him out of trouble when you’re not home.In addition, since Poms can be very difficult to housetrain, crate training is a good alternative.Crate training make take some time,especially since Pom puppies can be willful and stubborn.
Visit your local pet store to select a crate size and design that will be comfortable for your Pom.
When done properly, crate training will allow your Pom to see the crate as a place of safety, not punishment.Crate training involves introducing your Pom to the crate, feeding him inside of it, and gradually leaving him in the crate for longer periods of time (including at night).Rewarding your Pom with verbal praise and extra treats will encourage him to see the crate as something positive.

, When you first bring your Pom home, you may notice that his sleep schedule does not align with yours. It can take some time for a dog to adjust to the sleep pattern of his owner,so be patient with your Pom as you train him to sleep at night.


Create a comfortable area for your Pom puppy to sleep. Make this area easily accessible to your Pom so he can rest there at any time of day. He may feel isolated and stay awake at night if he associates the rest area only with the dark.In the evenings, dim the lights and turn down the noise on the TV so your Pom knows that it’s time to go sleep.Do not rush to your Pom if he whines and barks during the night. If you do this, he will associate his noise with getting attention from you, which will certainly affect your sleep quality. Let him soothe himself back to sleep.Puppy poms typically sleep 18 to 20 hours a day. Adult poms usually sleep 12 to 14 hours a day, including a few naps during the day., Poms bark a lot and have a surprisingly loud bark, making them great watchdogs. However, Poms do not always know when to stop barking, which can turn the barking into more of a nuisance than anything else.It is important for you to train your Pom not to bark.


Training your Pom dog not to bark begins with teaching him how to bark on command. When you have your Pom’s attention, give a short verbal command (‘speak,’ ‘bark’) and let him bark a few times. Hold a treat in front of his nose and let him have the treat when he stops barking.When your Pom responds to the command to bark, give him a command to stop barking (‘quiet’).After a few repetitions and rewards for not barking, your Pom will learn when to bark and when not to bark.

, Poms have a lot of energy and love to go out on long walks.Daily walks are an important way to give your Pom the exercise he needs. To make the walking experience more enjoyable for the both of you, train him to walk properly on a leash.


Your Pom puppy will need some time getting used to the leash before you put it on him. Let him sniff and explore the leash.
It can be helpful to carry treats with you during the first few times you are leash training your Pom.Reward him with a treat when he doesn’t pull on the leash.
Your puppy Pom may want to pull on the leash. Rather than yanking on the leash, stand still or start walking in the other direction.If he decides to lie down during the walk, call him to you and give him a treat when he comes., A healthy, well-balanced diet is essential to your Pom’s good health. High-quality commercial foods will provide your Pom with all of the nutrients he needs to be healthy and live a full and active life. With so many dog food choices, focus on the food label to help you make a good choice.


High-quality foods will have a specific meat (e.g., chicken, beef) listed first on the ingredient label. Look for other protein sources or dairy products to be listed within the first three to five ingredients.Look for the phrase ‘complete and balanced’ on the food label.High-quality foods will also have a statement on the bag stating the food meets the nutritional standards set by the Association of American Feed Control Officials.Your Pom will need to eat food that is specifically formulated for small breed dogs.If you have a puppy, he will need a puppy-specific food that contains the nutrients he needs to help him grow.Do not be swayed by labels such as ‘premium’ or ‘natural.’ More times than not, these are just marketing terms to get you to purchase the product.Ask your veterinarian (or breeder, if you purchased a puppy) about high-quality foods that would be good for your Pom.

, Poms are tiny animals, so their stomachs cannot hold much food at a time. In addition to being extra tiny, Pom puppies have very high metabolisms, which means they burn calories very quickly. If you have a puppy Pom, try to feed him three to four times a day.For puppies, feed the amount that is listed on the food bag label.Divide this amount into three or four daily feedings.
If you have an adult pom, feed him one-fourth to one-half cup of food per day, divided into two meals.How much you feed your Pom can depend on different factors, including age, activity, and overall health status.Speak with your veterinarian about your Pom’s specific nutritional needs.

, Water is an essential part of your Pom’s diet. He should have access to clean, fresh water at all times. If you have a puppy, considering putting the water in a shallow, tip-proof bowl., Poms have a double coat that needs frequent brushing and combing. The undercoat is soft and dense, and the top coat is long and coarse to the touch.To prevent your Pom’s coat from getting mattes or tangles, you should brush and comb it on a daily basis.If daily grooming is not practical for you, tend to his coat at least twice a week.You will need a bristle brush and metal comb, both of which are available at your local pet store. Try to find a brush with curved bristles.To brush his coat, part the hair with your hands and brush downward from the part (‘line brushing’). Be gentle to avoid damaging his skin.After brushing, use the comb to gently comb out any mattes and tangles.Make sure to brush and comb all the way down to his skin. Proper technique will keep his skin and coat healthy by evenly distributing natural oils., You do not need to bathe your Pom very often—once a month is often sufficient. Bathe him with a dog-specific shampoo for sensitive skin, such as oatmeal shampoo.Make sure the shampoo is free of artificial fragrances or colors.Quality shampoo ingredients to look for include vitamin E and aloe vera, which are good moisturizers.Do not use human shampoo, since its acidic pH can irritate your Pom’s skin.After you rinse out the shampoo, spritz a leave-in conditioner throughout his coat to keep it healthy.Briefly blot his coat dry with a towel, then dry him off completely with a hairdryer set at the lowest setting.Not all dogs like hairdryers, though, so your Pom may prefer being dried off with towels.
To give his coat even more sheen and shine, brush his coat with the slicker brush after you’ve dried him off., In addition to bathing your Pom and brushing/combing his coat, you will also need to trim his nails, clean his eyes and ears, and brush his teeth. Trim his nails once every one to two weeks to keep them from growing too long.Plan to clean his eyes and ears on a daily basis.Guillotine nail clippers are easier to use than scissor-type clippers.Purchase clippers at your local pet store.
Trim his nails down to about two millimeters above the quick (the vein running up the middle of each nail). Cutting the quick causes the nail to bleed, and can be painful for your Pom.If you are not comfortable trimming your dog’s nails, ask your veterinarian or groomer to perform this task.
You will need specific cleaning solutions to clean your dog’s eyes and ears. Your veterinarian can recommend which cleaning solutions to use and give you instructions on how to use them.
Ideally, you should brush your Pom’s teeth once a day. If this is not practical for you, aim to brush his teeth at least once a week.Choose a dog-specific toothbrush and toothpaste, both of which are available at your local pet store. It is best to start brushing your Pom’s teeth when he is young so he can get used to the activity., For this reason, some Pom owners will decide to give their Pom a short haircut. This may seem convenient at first, but giving your Pom a lion cut has some disadvantages. For example, it takes away some of your Pom’s natural protection against the elements (e.g., rain, cold).In addition, once a Pom’s coat is cut short, there is no guarantee it will grow back with the same shape or thickness as before.Rather than cut your Pom’s coat short, you may have to invest in getting his coat professionally groomed if you are unable to do it yourself.

, Poms are athletic little bundles of energy. A long daily walk will help him expend that energy.Poms love to play as well, but playtime is not a substitute for a walk.In some dogs, not having a daily walk can lead to the development of behavioral problems.Poms are very sensitive to heat,so do not take your Pom out on long walks when it is hot outside.

, Poms love to play, so you should engage in multiple, short playtimes with your Pom each day.If you have a backyard with some trees, your Pom will enjoy running around and chasing leaves.Fortunately, Poms do not need to go outside for playtime, so you can plenty of fun with him indoors.


Poms have a moderate energy level,so do not push your Pom too hard to run and play.

, Since Poms can get bored very easily, you should give your Pom plenty of toys from which to choose. He will especially like toys that give him a mental challenge, such as puzzle toys. Rotate the toys out frequently.Choose toys have that have different colors and textures to keep your Pom interested in playing with them.Cozy stuffed toys can provide your Pom with comfort when you are not home.If you have a puppy, purchase some teething toys that will keep him from chewing on your furniture or shoes.Instead of buying new toys all of the time, you can try giving your Pom a different combination of the same toys.

, Poms are eager to learn new things.They also love to be the center of attention,so teaching your Pom new tricks will make him very happy! There are many tricks you can teach your Pom, like playing dead, grabbing paw, and playing fetch.


Poms tend to have short attention spans, so keep your training sessions short (5 to 10 minutes).Get creative and have fun with teaching your Pom new tricks. Not only will this keep your Pom physically and mentally active, you will be able to strengthen your bond with him.

, Although Pomeranians are generally healthy and robust dogs,they can develop a number of health conditions throughout their lives. For example, small breed dogs are especially prone to collapsed tracheas and patellar luxation (kneecap shifts away from its normal position).Pomeranians can also have a heart defect called patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), which occurs when blood does not start flowing to the lungs after a puppy is born. PDA symptoms may not be obvious, but you may notice your puppy Pom is not very active and not growing as quickly as he should.Pomeranians can develop different eye problems, including cataracts and tear duct problems.As your Pom grows older, he may develop bald spots due a condition called ‘black-skin’ disease. Fortunately, it is treatable in some cases.Other health issues in Pomeranians are food allergies, epilepsy, and an orthopedic problem called Legg-Perthes. Legg-Perthes, common in puppies four to six months old, occurs when the head of the femur (thighbone) starts to disintegrate from lack of blood flow., Poms are also susceptible to tooth decay,so it is important to have your veterinarian clean your Pom’s teeth regularly. Your veterinarian can evaluate your Pom’s teeth and oral health to determine how often his teeth should be cleaned.


Veterinary dental cleanings require general anesthesia, so it will probably be expensive to have your Pom’s teeth cleaned. However, not having his teeth cleaned regularly could lead to very serious oral health problems that could end up costing you more in the future.

, Veterinary visits will help keep your Pom up to date with his vaccinations and allow your veterinarian to assess his overall health. If you have a young puppy, take him to the veterinarian every three to four weeks until he is 16 weeks old so he can get vaccinated.Your puppy will also need to get started on a heartworm preventative and get heartworm tested.Your puppy will also need to be dewormed during his first few weeks of life to get rid of intestinal parasites.
If you have an adult pom, take him to the veterinarian at least once a year,but more often if he has specific health issues that need more attention.

Lather up your poodle’s coat and gently rinse out the shampoo. Repeat this process with conditioner designed for dogs if you want to make your poodle’s coat even more soft and luxurious.It is important to bathe your poodle once every three weeks or so. After a couple weeks, the oils and debris start to build up in your pet’s coat and they will start to weigh down and diminish the sheen on your poodle’s coat.
To begin, you’ll need to place your poodle on a nonstick surface in the bathtub and wet it down with lukewarm water.;
, After the bath is over, use a towel to dry off the excess water. Then use a hair blow dryer to gently blow dry your poodle’s coat. Be sure to use the blow dryer on the lowest setting possible.Remember that blow drying can be a terrifying experience for your dog, especially the first few times you expose your dog to it. Make an effort to calm your dog while you blow dry it. Stroke the dog calmly and speak to it in a soft voice to reassure it. You can even introduce the dog to the blow dryer sound slowly before you start the process.
Begin blow drying with the largest swatches of hair first, as this will be the most efficient way to start. Spend some time blow drying your dog’s back first, then move down to the legs and belly. Dry the hair on your dog’s head and tail last.
You can also let your poodle’s hair air dry, but this will lead to small, curly ringlets. If you want your poodle’s coat to be fluffy, you’ll need to blow dry it.

, To get the fluffy hair look, brush against the grain of the hair. If the hair gets too fluffy for your taste, you can simply brush back with the grain to tame it a bit. As you blow dry, use a dog brush to comb out any tangles as they occur. This will be much easier than trying to work out the tangles after the coat is already dry.Fluffing up the hair will also make the shaving process easier. With the hair fluffed up, you will be able to trim, shave, and shape your dog’s hair with less difficulty.

, To begin the clipper work, put a #10 or #15 on the clipper. Carefully use the razor to shave the hair – place the razor on the fur being careful not to push down too hard so you don’t accidentally cut your dog’s skin. Start to shave the face by starting in the middle of the eyes, right at the bridge, and shave down. Then shave the cheeks, then the upper lips, then the lower, then under the eye to the corner of the eye to the outer ear in a straight line.Move the razor especially slowly while you shave around the dog’s eyes. Be careful not to get the razor too close to your dog’s eyes.

, Once you finish shaving your dog’s face, you can move on to the neck area. Begin at the top near the head and shave down to your dog’s Adam's apple making a V. Then stop and do the other side. Next, start shaving the neck inside the V you made.


Make sure you create clean, straight lines when making the V shape so the grooming effect looks professional.

, Begin shaving the feet by holding the dog's paw in your hand. With a #15 on the clipper, use your fingers to spread the toes apart and shave in between them. Be careful not to nick the webbing between the toes. Shave around the toenails.Also shave up to where the dog bends its paw, then have a line all the way around the paw. Do the pads and shave up to the dew claws and then stop.

, Come back up to the middle of the back and shave the hair out. Be sure to leave hair on the shoulders and on the hips, just rounding it off on the ends and up under the dog as well. Make sure that the elbows of the dog and the flanks don't show. They are to be rounded in as well as the chest.The hair on the chest stays, as opposed to in a lamb cut where the chest is shaved.

, Begin to set the pattern by using a #10 or #15 blade, depending on what the dog can handle without burning. Start at the neck by shaving it completely out. At the middle of the shoulder blades, make a straight line all the way down the spine to the dock of the tail and then stop.Use the clippers to make a ring around the tail. This is one of the most characteristic features of the Town and Country cut.

, To set the cuff (the hair above the shaved paw), comb the hair down and cut it up to where you left the line on the paw so it doesn't hang on the ground. Next, round the hair off so that it attains the curved appearance you want with this cut.Use scissors to make the rounded, shaved look above the paws.

, Blending the coat helps erase the edges between the shaved parts and the unshaved parts of your dog’s coat. A nice length to work with is three to four inches long. Then use your razor to round off the remaining hair. Use the scissors to catch any stray hairs the clippers may have missed.Now begin to scissor the legs by blending them, working your way up to the elbow and blending the hair in to the shoulder.
Then do the other side until done. Make sure it is all even across the whole coat.

, Once you have finished shaving and trimming your dog, there will be a bit of a mess to clean up. There will be quite a bit of excess hair stuck around your dog’s body and the area you used for the dog grooming. Sweep up all of the discarded hair and thrown it away to minimize the mess.


Use a damp towel to wipe off any excess hair that may be stuck to your dog’s body. You could even give your dog another bath to clean it up, as long as you don’t mind the effort of washing and drying your dog’s hair all over again.

Simply lift up the dog's ear to expose the skin and gently clean the area with the cotton dipped in the cleaner.


Never put any cotton tips or cotton buds down into the ear canal. If the dog moves suddenly it could force the cotton bud deep into the ear and cause damage.
The non-alcohol-based cleaner will not sting the dog's ear like alcohol may.;
, Carefully trim the dogs nails by lifting their paws from behind and allowing the leg to bend at the joint. This is easier than trying to pull the paw toward you from the front. Try to identify the quick and leave a 4 to 5 millimeters length of nail to protect the quick. If you can't see the quick, nibble tiny amounts of nail away with the clippers just in case the dog has long quicks, which could bleed.


Cut the nails using clippers specifically made for trimming dog nails.
Keep styptic powder nearby to stop bleeding if you do accidentally cut the nails too short.

, After you have trimmed your Pomeranian's nails, use a file made for dog nails to file until smooth. Be sure to praise your pet when you are finished in order to help them be more cooperative when you trim their nails in the future.

, Bathe your Pomeranian prior to clipping so that your clipper blades do not get dull from oily fur. Some oils, however, are good for the dog's coat, so you should only bathe him or her about every three months unless otherwise necessary., Place a non-slip mat or towel in your bathtub or in a large kitchen sink and fill with warm water. Lower the dog into the water, but be prepared for the animal to react—some dogs like baths, while others do not. For this reason, it is a good idea to have an assistant to help. Use a cup or pitcher to pour water gently over the dog, wetting the entire coat thoroughly, but be careful not to get water in the ear canal. You can use cotton swabs in the ears to help, but do not push them too far in.


Avoid getting water in the dog's eyes.

, Be sure to get the soap on his or her whole body, massaging it in gently as you do. Work from head to tail using a shampoo made specifically for use on dogs. Be sure scrub all areas of the animal evenly, including the tail, belly, legs, paws, etc. , Rinsing your Pomeranian thoroughly is very important, as leftover shampoo that is not rinsed off properly can cause irritation. Use a sprayer, if possible, to rinse the dog, as it will more easily reach the skin and help remove all soap.

, Drying your dog well will facilitate the rest of the grooming process. You can use a blow dryer or allow the dog to air dry. Be careful to thoroughly dry the dog's ears with a dry towel or paper towel. Parasites, bacteria, and yeast can build up there if not dried effectively.

, Using a toothbrush and toothpaste made for dogs, brush your Pomeranian's teeth thoroughly. Some dogs may not like having teeth brushed and may resist, but keep trying for about five minutes per day, and over time your dog will be used to having his or her teeth cleaned, making teeth-brushing easier.


Do not brush too hard, as dogs have sensitive gums.
Brushing your dog's teeth can prevent potentially fatal bacterial infections., Monthly application of a flea and tick preventative can help keep your Pomeranian healthy and beautiful. Some shampoos include a flea treatment, while other treatments are applied separately.

, Brush your dog's coat using a wire-pin or firm bristle bristle brush.Daily brushing is best, but a minimum of two brushings per week is recommended.Brush out from the skin instead of along the body.Regular brushings will help keep your dog's coat free of tangles.

, It is widely recommended that you do not brush a Pomeranian's coat when it is dry. Doing so can cause static and strip the protective layer of the hair shaft, causing split ends. Mist the coat with a leave-in conditioner or a homemade leave-in conditioner that is 10% good quality bathing conditioner mixed with 90% filtered water.You can also simply brush the dog's coat after bathing.

, After brushing, comb through your Pomeranian's coat with a fine-tooth steel comb to find any tangles.You can try to use your spray-on conditioner to get the tangle out, but if that doesn't work, use scissors to cut it out.


Use safety scissors available for dogs to ensure you don't injure your pet should he make a sudden movement while you are cutting.

, The lion cut for Pomeranians accentuate the lion-like appearance the dog has. The shoulders, face, and chest retain thick fur, while the rest of the body is clipped very close to the skin with clippers. The tail does retain a thick-haired tip to complete the lion look.


The mane must be regularly groomed to prevent tangling, etc.
Shaving the dog's skin too close can result in sores, ingrown hairs, or sunburn, so pay close attention., The Pomeranian puppy cut is also referred to as a teddy bear cut. All hair on the coat is trimmed to a two to three inch length, with the face and legs rounded. This gives the dog a uniform look that is similar to the appearance of a teddy bear or puppy.

, In some cases you may need to shave your Pomeranian, such as if the fur becomes matted or tangled. This is also a style you may choose if you cannot brush the dog regularly. The drawback here is that the coat may not grow back as lush as it was prior to shaving., Show cuts are standardized by the kennel club of which you are a part. They are usually meant to show the natural coat of the animal, so minimal styling is necessary, though light trimming to keep the shape is usually permitted. Light trimming around the paws, eyes, and sanitary areas is permitted in general.
Check with your kennel club for specific guidelines.

, Exercising your dog prior to trimming can minimize the dog's activity during grooming, which is safer. He or she may also be willing to sit still longer, giving you more time in which to complete grooming.

, Good quality tools for grooming will make the job easier for you and more comfortable for the dog. Good quality scissors and clippers will minimize hair-pulling and help ensure your cuts are clean and even. Be sure to use the correct blades for the clippers you buy and the correct lengths, etc. for the clipping you are doing.

, Turn the clippers on near the dog before using so they get used to the sound. Doing this when the dog is very young can help train the dog to be comfortable with the clippers later on.

, Use electric clippers for ease. You should also trim around sanitary areas. Read the instructions for your clippers to be sure you are using them properly. This includes selecting the right blades for each area you are trimming.

, You will want to trim and shape the dog's coat to give him the trademark fluffy look this breed is known for. Trim feet, shape the rear, and scissor the back, sides, underline, and chest to achieve this effect. You will also need to trim the tail, ears, and head.

Look at your Pomeranian’s skin.,
Have your vet diagnose your Pomeranian.",How to Treat Adrenal Gland Disease in Pomeranians," This is often the first treatment strategy for Alopecia X. For many dogs with this condition, surgical removal of the reproductive organs will lead to hair regrowth.A spay is the removal of a female dog’s uterus and ovaries. A neuter is the removal of a male dog’s testicles.


Another name for Alopecia X is ‘castration-responsive alopecia.’Castration is another term for spaying or neutering.;
, The hair regrowth after a spay or neuter is not immediate. It may take several months for the hair to grow back.If the hair doesn’t regrow after this time period, your vet will recommend other treatment options.


Even if your Pomeranian’s hair grows back after surgery, it may fall out again., Other treatment options for Alopecia X are melatonin, mitotane, and growth hormone. As you discuss the different treatment options, remember that Alopecia X is a cosmetic problem—your Pomeranian will not become sick from this disease.If you decide not to pursue any other treatments for the disease, your Pomeranian will be just fine.

, Melatonin is the first medication a vet will prescribe to treat Alopecia X. It is a nutritional supplement that promotes hair growth. Once maximal hair regrowth occurs, your vet will gradually reduce the dosage. Be mindful that if you stop the melatonin treatment and your Pomeranian’s hair starts falling out, giving melatonin again may not work.Given twice a day, melatonin leads to hair regrowth in 30 to 40% of dogs with Alopecia X.Melatonin itself does not cause the hair regrowth, but helps restore the body’s seasonal rhythm of hair shedding and regrowth. It will essentially trick the body into thinking it’s the season for hair regrowth.Your vet may recommend giving melatonin with an oral retinoid, which is similar to vitamin A. The oral retinoid will encourage growth of the hair follicle.Melatonin is available over-the-counter at your local drug store.

, Melatonin is also prescribed as a sleep aide. If your Pomeranian becomes sleepy after a dose of melatonin, consider giving administering it shortly before bedtime.If your Pomeranian seems extremely sluggish or groggy, your vet may have to lower the dosage., Melatonin can cause the body to become resistant to insulin, the substance that helps maintain normal blood glucose levels.If your Pomeranian has diabetes, the melatonin could worsen that condition.

, If neither surgery nor melatonin worked, you could have your veterinarian submit 2 blood samples for a detailed analysis of adrenal sex hormones. The first will be a baseline sample and the second will be taken 1 hour after your vet gives your Pomeranian a hormone called ACTH (stimulates adrenal gland function). Results of the analysis can help your vet determine which other Alopecia X treatments to use.The test, which is performed by University of Tennessee’s College of Veterinary Medicine, is quite expensive.Your vet can help you decide whether to have the test performed.

, Correcting adrenal sex hormone imbalances is another treatment strategy for Alopecia X. Mitotane, a drug normally used to treat Cushing’s disease, can also treat Alopecia X. It destroys the sex hormone-producing section of the adrenal glands.Mitotane treats Cushing’s disease by destroying the cortisol-producing sections of the adrenal glands. This destruction can be permanent, leading to a serious cortisol deficiency condition called Addison’s Disease.Mitotane can cause numerous side effects, including vomiting, decreased appetite, and various neurologic signs (e.g., stupor, circling).Mitotane would need to be given at a lower dosage and frequency than melatonin. In addition, your vet would need to take frequent blood samples to assess liver function and measure adrenal sex hormone levels., A growth hormone injection may help your Pomeranian’s hair grow back. However, injectable growth hormone, which is very expensive, can lead to the development of diabetes. In addition, hair starts falling out again after growth hormone treatment is discontinued.Discuss with your vet whether growth hormone injections would be a good idea for your Pomeranian.

, Even though a number of treatment options are available for Alopecia X treatment, they are unlikely to be 100% effective for the long term. One way or another, your Pomeranian’s hair will likely fall out again after treatment has stopped. Hair loss can occur as early as 1 month, or as late as several years, after the last treatment., Hair loss due to Alopecia X is gradual and symmetrical. Beginning as early as 1 year of age, the hair loss occurs over the torso and the backs of the thighs, but does not affect the head or front legs. Your Pomeranian’s outer coat will go first, exposing a soft and fuzzy ‘puppy’ coat. Eventually, this puppy coat will also go.The top of your Pomeranian’s tail may be the first place you notice the hair loss.The exact cause of hair loss remains unknown, explaining the ‘X’ in the condition’s name. It may be caused an enzyme deficiency in the adrenal glands that eventually leads to decreased adrenal function and hair loss., Alopecia X often causes the skin to darken, a condition called hyperpigmentation.Fortunately, skin affected by Alopecia X is not itchy.Therefore, your Pomeranian’s skin will not show signs of irritation or infection (e.g., redness, thickened skin, draining sores).

, Since Alopecia X can resemble other hormone-related diseases (Cushing’s disease, hypothyroidism), your vet must first make sure your Pomeranian does not have these diseases. To rule out hypothyroidism (under-functioning thyroid gland), your vet will test your Pomeranian’s blood for levels of a thyroid hormone called T-4. Testing the blood for specific adrenal hormones will help rule out Cushing’s disease (overproduction of adrenal cortisol).Cortisol is one of the steroid hormones produced by the adrenal glands.
In addition to these specific blood tests, your vet will take blood and urine samples for a broad analysis of your Pomeranian’s health. They may also take a skin biopsy."

Continue wiping the folds until the cloth is clean after wiping.Make sure to be gentle. Wiping too hard can cause irritation to your pug's skin.
Use one sweeping motion when wiping the folds. You do not want to rub the skin.
Be sure to wipe the entire length of the facial fold.

, Once you've finished cleaning one side of your dog's face, repeat the process on the other side. Use the same process as before. Remember to be gentle and not to rub your dog's skin., Leaving the skin between folds wet can cause complications. This greatly increases your dog's risk for skin irritation, rashes, and infections. After you finish cleaning the skin between the folds, use a clean cloth to wipe the skin dry.Again, use a single sweeping motion. Make sure not to rub the skin.
Keep swiping until the wrinkle is completely dry to the touch.

, You want your dog to leave a grooming session feeling positive. If your dog dislikes cleaning, it may become resistant to the process. Always make sure to reward your dog after cleaning its facial folds.Give your dog a treat and praise after you finish the cleaning process.
You should also talk to your dog throughout the process. Praise it for sitting still and allowing you to clean it.

Choose a food formulated for your dog's age.,
Choose a completely dry food diet.,
Schedule the frequency of feedings depending on your dog's age.,
Give your dog plenty of water.",How to Care for a Toy Poodle1," Depending on their age, dogs require different levels of protein, calories and other nutrients. There are different types of dog food formulated for puppies, adult dogs and senior dogs.



Puppies: Puppies need higher levels of protein for their muscles, calories for growth, and calcium for healthy bones. If your toy poodle is a puppy under 12 months of age, feed it dog food that is specially designed for puppies. These are usually labelled as ""puppy food"" or ""growth"" foods.Choose a puppy food designed for toy dogs. This is because the kibble size is smaller and easier for your puppy's tiny teeth to deal with.

Adult dogs: When your dog reaches about 12 months of age, feed it food formulated for adult dogs. Keep them on this food until they are about 7 years old. These foods are nutritionally balanced to provide an adult dog's dietary needs.

Senior dogs: When your adult toy poodle is 7 years and older, switch to a senior food. These contain reduced level of minerals such as phosphate that the kidney finds more difficult to process. By switching to a senior food, you can help protect your pet's renal function.;
, The options for feeding are a complete dry diet (often known as kibble) or a wet diet of canned food with the addition of mixer biscuits. Dry foods are healthier for the dog's teeth, because chewing on the biscuit helps keep them clean. Wet foods can be more appealing to toy breeds, but the sticky canned or pouched food does stick to teeth and encourage plaque formation.


If possible, start your toy poodle pup on a complete dry diet to help promote dental health.
Look for a food designed for toy breeds, which will make chewing on the kibble less troublesome.

, When your dog is a puppy, it has a smaller stomach and needs to be fed more frequently than when it is an adult.



Puppies: Feed your toy poodle puppy small meals frequently. The general rule is 4 meals a day up to 3 months of age; 3 meals a day up to 6 months of age; 2 meals a day from 6 months through adulthood.

Adult and senior dogs: Feed your adult or senior dog 2 meals per day. Two meals is recommended because a toy poodle's small stomach capacity means he prefers to eat smaller meals more often., Always have a bowl of water available for your dog. Refresh the water every day and clean the bowl every few days.

Watch for odd patches of fur.,
Look for symmetrical hair loss.,
Watch for dark patches of skin.,
Be alert for any lack of hair growth.,
Know that this condition can affect any dog.",How to Diagnose Adrenal Gland Disease in Pomeranians1," One of the first signs of adrenal gland disease is patches of hair that look different than the rest of the coat. These patches will contain hair that is short and oddly textured, like wool., When a dog has adrenal gland disease, the Pomeranian sheds her fur right down to the skin and the fur doesn't regrow. The fur loss is in a symmetrical pattern so the hair loss on the left of the body mirrors that on the right.Hair loss usually occurs on the trunk and back thighs, and not on the head or front legs., When the dog loses her hair, the exposed skin often becomes hyperpigmented. This means that the skin changes from a regular pink or beige color into a dark brown or black color. Additionally, the skin is often dry and scaly., Another way you know your Pomeranian has this condition is that hair does not regrow after it has been clipped or shaved., Pomeranians of any age or sex can be affected. This means that through your dog’s entire life, you need to watch for signs of this condition.Although a dog can get this condition any time, the dog is healthy otherwise even if she does start to show the symptoms.

Prepare the area.,
Brush your poodle.,

Dry your poodle’s hair.",How to Do a Palm Springs on a Poodle1," Grooming your poodle can create quite a mess, even if you are relatively careful during the process. You’ll want to bathe and groom your poodle somewhere that is easy to clean up – like the bathroom, in the garage, or outside (weather permitting).


Choose an area that works for you and get it ready with the towels, hair dryer, clippers, scissors, and anything else you may need.;
, Brush and comb your dog's coat out to where there are no mats. Washing a matted poodle is much harder to do. Use a dog brush to gently comb out your poodle’s hair and work on getting out all of the matted tangles.You should brush your poodle regularly (at least once a week) to keep its hair from getting matted between baths.

, Give your dog a bath in the bathtub. Be sure to use a nonslip surface in the bathtub, like a bath mat, to help your dog avoid slipping in the tub. Use shampoo made for dogs and gently lather and rinse it all throughout your poodle’s coat.Never use human shampoo on a dog. You need to buy shampoo that is specially formulated for canines.
To help your poodle’s coat remain extra soft, you may want to consider using conditioner on your poodle after shampooing. Simply lather and rinse the conditioner in the same way you use the shampoo.

, Squeeze out some of the excess water with your hands and then use a clean towel to towel dry the rest of the excess water. You can also let your poodle shake to get rid of some of the extra moisture. After this, use a hair blow dryer on the lowest setting to dry your poodle’s hair the rest of the way.Letting your poodle air dry is another possible option, but this will lead to curly ringlets rather than smooth, fluffy hair. To get the fluffy look, you must blow dry your poodle’s hair.

Clip the neck band.",How to Do a Banded Dutch on a Poodle1," With one hand, hold your poodle’s head with your fingers on the top of its head and your thumb under its chin. Then, place a number 10 clipper, with the blade flat, and clip from the outside corner of the eye to the ear. Also, shave the coat in front of the ear.When shaving your poodle, make sure to let the blade rest in between shavings. This will allow the blade to cool down.;
, Continue to clip your dog’s cheeks and the bridge of the nose up to its eyes. Form a slight inverted “V” between your dog’s eyes, and continue to shave down the sides of the face to the throat. When clipping the throat, a good standard is to clip down the approximate length of the muzzle.For example, if your dog’s muzzle is five inches, then clip five inches down the throat.
Once both sides of the face and neck are shaved, a “U” shaped pattern will appear on the throat.

, Clean up the neck with the clippers. Shave all hair off of the throat. When shaving the throat, you may shave against the direction of the coat. However, if your dog’s’ skin does not tolerate this, then do not clip against the direction of the hair growth., Starting at the back of your poodle’s neck, begin to clip the neck band with a number 10 clipper. Start at a half-inch to an inch above the shoulder blades, and shave a band around your poodle’s neck. The band should be where your poodle’s collar usually rests.Go over the line once more with your clipper to set the line.
Try to avoid clipping too low so you have room to clean up your lines.

Take care of the poodle's coat in between baths.",How to Blow Dry a Poodle," Use warm water to rinse out all traces of soap. If any shampoo remains in your dog's coat while you blow dry it, the soap can cause dryness and skin irritation.Make sure that the water is warm, not hot.
Since poodle hair is so dense, it can take a long time for water to thoroughly saturate it. It is crucial that you do not rush the process and patiently make sure that all traces of shampoo are out of the coat before proceeding further.
Avoid spraying the poodle's eyes with water and do not let any of the suds get into the dog's eyes, either. You may wish to protect the poodle's eyes by applying a thin coat of petroleum jelly or mineral oil around the outer perimeter of the eye.
You may have to “knead” the poodle's coat as you rinse it to make sure that all traces of shampoo are scrubbed out.;
, After washing your poodle with water and dog shampoo, consider applying a dog conditioner to the coat. The conditioner will improve the health of your dog's coat and will make the blow drying process easier.


Follow the instructions on the dog conditioner regarding proper application. Some conditioners should be left in, while others will need to be rinsed out.
You could also opt for a detangler spray instead of a conditioner. Detangler will not offer the same overall health benefits for the poodle's coat, but it will still make combing and drying the coat easier.

, Gently brush your dog's wet coat with a slicker brush to remove any knots that developed during bath time.


A slicker brush is a special type of brush that has thin metal wire tines poking up from a foam or rubber base. The design of the brush makes it easier to remove tangles and dead clumps of loose hair.
Note that you could also use a large plastic comb during this stage. The comb will help you remove large knots but may not remove as many fine tangles as a slicker brush would.

, Wring out as much moisture as possible from the longest parts of your poodle's fur by gently squeezing the fur in between your hands.Focus on the tail and paws. Most of the water will accumulate in these areas, so most of the excess you need to remove during this step will be in these areas.
Squeeze gently. Never pinch the dog's skin and avoid putting too much pressure on the dog's tails or legs. Also avoid pulling the hair as you wring it out.

, Toss a soft towel over the dog. Rub and blot away as much moisture from the coat as possible using this towel.


The towel should be large enough to cover the dog and made from an absorbent material, like terry cloth.
Since poodles have a dense coat, you should work on blotting the water out rather than scrubbing it out. A lot of rubbing can cause the fur to become tangled, making it more difficult to comb out during the blow drying process.
While towel drying the dog, check in its ears. Lightly dab away any noticeable moisture inside the poodle's ears. If you allow excess moisture to remain in a dog's ears, it can easily cause a painful infection.

, If you have managed to prevent your dog from shaking and splattering water all over the place before this moment, now is the time for you to drop your guard and let your dog shake itself.


Most dogs will want to shake their fur to remove excess water immediately after the bath, if not during it. Try to prevent your dog from doing so at those points to reduce the mess.
Since shaking is so natural, though, it is recommended that you let your poodle shake after you have towel dried as much excess moisture as possible. Doing so will make the dog feel better, and it will also help your dog dry faster overall.

, Set your blow dryer on the lowest heat setting possible and hold it a forearm's length away from the coat. Dry your poodle off with the blow dryer, maintaining this setting and distance the entire time.


If possible, use a blow dryer specifically made for dogs and other pets. These machines are less likely to burn your dog than a human hair dryer is. A human blow dryer can still be used, if necessary, as long as it remains on a low to cool setting.
It is better for your poodle to blow dry the coat rather than letting it air dry. Air drying will increase the number of mats and tangles that form.
If you do choose to air dry your poodle, be aware of the fact that the hair will dry in curly ringlets. The only way to make the hair fluffy and straight is to dry the dog with a blow dryer.

, As you blow dry the poodle's coat, you should simultaneously brush out any knots and mats with a slicker brush.If you do not brush and dry simultaneously, the coat will become more matted due to the force of the air blowing on it. These tangles will be more difficult to remove once the coat is dry than they will be to remove while the coat is in the process of drying.
Brushing the poodle's coat as you dry it will also help the coat become softer and fluffier.

, If you aren't careful, you could accidentally burn or hurt the poodle while drying its coat. As long as you pay attention as you work, however, the dog should be perfectly fine by the end of the process.


Do not allow the blow dryer to come too close to the dog's skin, even if you have it set to a low heat. Your poodle's skin is too sensitive to heat, and even low dryer settings can cause the dog's skin to burn or otherwise become irritated.
Never aim the blow dryer at the poodle's face. It is best to towel dry the hair on your dog's face, or to otherwise let it air dry. The skin of the face is especially sensitive to heat and prone to burning.
If you use an automated dryer that hangs in front of a crated or leashed dog, you should test the temperature before aiming it at the poodle. You should also check the poodle every 5 to 10 minutes to make sure that the dog is still safe and not suffering from the heat.

, After the poodle is completely dry, take a few minutes to brush out any knots you may have missed during the drying process. As before, use a slicker brush for best results.

, Proper coat care will make both the bathing and drying process easier later on. The most important thing you need to do is simply to regularly brush the dog's coat.


Brush your poodle at least twice a week, if not more frequently.
Regular brushing will spread the natural oils produced by the skin throughout the coat, keeping it healthy. It also prevents tangles and mats, which can become painful for your dog if allowed to increase too severely.
In between baths, brush your poodle with a natural bristle brush, especially on areas with longer hair. Use a slicker brush afterward to pull out any mats and dead hair. A comb can be run through the dog's hair after that to catch any additional tangles.

Keep your dog’s coat free from snags.,
Groom your dog every day.,
Use a comb or a stiff brush.,
Spritz the dog’s coat with water.,
Comb section by section.,
Clip your dog’s hair every 3-8 weeks.",How to Care for a Toy Poodle2," Poodles have a curly wiry coat that grows continually. Poodles do not shed hair in the same way as other breeds. Their hair does fall out, but it gets tangled with the rest of the coat. This means poodles are very liable to getting knots and tangles.Puppies have a soft coat, which starts to be replaced by adult fur from about 6-9 months of age. A full changeover to the adult coat can take until the pet is 18 months old.

, Take a few minutes every day to groom your dog. This will serve a dual purpose: you will be able to detangle his hair and you will be giving him some much-needed attention.

, To comb through the snags, use a comb or brush that is available at a pet store. You may also want to use both, using a comb on certain parts of the dog's body and a brush on other parts.

, Before you start combing, spray your toy poodle’s coat with a light mist of water. This will help avoid static build-up. It can also help prevent dry hair from snagging together.

, Separate off a section of coat and hold it between your fingers. Comb the coat by brushing from root to tip.


Groom the entire coat and be sure to comb behind the ears and under the tummy.

, A toy poodle’s hair grows all the time, so keeping it tidy requires clipping. Depending on how long or short you’d like to keep your dog’s coat, aim to get the hair clipped every 3-8 weeks.


This is usually done at a dog grooming parlor, but with access to good dog clippers, some practice, and plenty of time, you can learn to clip a dog yourself.

Consider plucking out your dog’s ear hair.,
Monitor the ears for problems.,
Visit your vet if you see a problem.",How to Care for a Toy Poodle3," Toy poodles have a tendency to have very hairy canals. The hair on their body extends down into the ear canal and can plug it - a bit like wearing furry ear plugs all the time. Check with your vet to determine an appropriate schedule for plucking hair.


Some experts' opinions vary about whether or not to pluck this hair. The argument for hair plucking is that is allows better air circulation and thus reduces the chances of ear infections, and that it removes hair that can trap earwax. Some argue, however, that hair plucking can leave your dog's ears sore and inflamed., Keep a close eye on your dog’s ears, especially if you do not pluck the hair. Be vigilant for ear infections (characterized by a bad smell, thick black wax, or discharge from the ear), or a foreign object in the ear (constantly scratching the ear, or holding the head to one side).

, If you notice signs that your dog has a problem with his ear, ask your vet to check for a health problem. They may advise you whether to pluck the ear hair more or less often.

Be aware of an unspecific diagnosis.,
Take your dog to the vet.,
Have multiple tests run.,
Notice the effects of this disease.,
Find the proper treatment.",How to Diagnose Adrenal Gland Disease in Pomeranians2," The problem with diagnosing adrenal gland disease is that vets aren't sure why it occurs in the first place. This makes it impossible to develop a single test that gives a definitive answer as whether baldness is specifically due adrenal gland disease or some other problem., The vet has to rule out all other problems which could cause hair loss. This means conducting an extensive array of tests searching for specific conditions, which can then be confirmed or crossed off the list. Once all these tests are done, and if they all come back negative, then the condition is likely to be adrenal gland disease.Adrenal gland disease is a diagnosis of exclusion, which means all other possible causes of hair loss have to be crossed off the list in order to diagnose the condition.
Many of the symptoms of adrenal gland disease, like hair loss, can be due to more serious diseases, such as Cushing's Disease.Alopecia X is not threatening, but other adrenal gland diseases can be serious if left untreated. This is why taking your dog to the vet is so important.

, The vet may want to run some or all of the following tests, which will prove or rule out other conditions which may be similar to adrenal gland disease. The tests include:Thyroid blood test
Adrenal hormone test
A urinalysis
Abdominal ultrasound
Skin scrapes
Skin biopsy
Screening blood tests

, When your dog gets this condition, know that it is a cosmetic condition. Your dog will not be in any pain. If your vet has ruled out any other underlying condition, then your dog can live a happy life with the condition., Most treatments for Alopecia X focus on helping the dog grow the coat back, but they are trial and error. Many adrenal gland problems are caused by hormonal imbalances, so dogs may be spayed or neutered. If this is not an option, melatonin therapy may be suggested.Other treatment options may be available if these don't work. However, they can cause adverse reactions, so the adverse health effects need to be considered next to the cosmetic benefits.

Lay out the plan for the grooming pattern.,
Shave the poodle’s back.,
Shave your poodle’s face.,
Start to clip the hair on the feet.",How to Do a Palm Springs on a Poodle2," Look at some pictures of this particular cut and familiarize yourself with the pattern. Start shaving the most important areas. Begin shaving the whole body at the hind end and work your way up to the front of the dog. Shave the chest and up under the dog and the belly.Make sure to shave down the legs all the way the hocks to the joint were the foot bends and then stop shaving. You need to leave this hair to shape later.

, Use a dog clipper with a ten blade to do this haircut with. To start this haircut, take the dog clipper with the ten blade and start at the back of the neck and shave down the back to the base of the tail. Move the clippers in a slow motion against the grain of the hair.If the hair seems too thick, you can use a comb and scissors to clip the hair shorter so you can go back over it with the clippers. Simply comb out the hair and use the scissors to cut the hair above the line of the comb.
Shave a one inch ring around the tail and leave a ball of hair at the end to shape later.

, To do the face, shave down the nose, go down the muzzle to the nose, and under the jaw. Next, go back up under the eye to the corner of the eye. From there, go straight to the outer ear and shave it clean.Make sure the lips are shaved clean. There should be no little stray hairs remaining.
Be very cautious when shaving your poodle’s face. Move the clippers very slowly and be careful not to touch them to your dog’s eyes or push too hard and irritate the sensitive skin on your dog’s face.

, Take the paw and hold it in your hand and shave it clean, including the under pad, until you clip up to the big joint on the foot. You can use scissors to get rid of most of the hair on the bottom of the paws if you are worried about using the clippers on them. By this time there will be four legs with shaggy hair on them so far and short, shaved hair on the body.Be careful not to nick the webbing between the toes as this is very delicate skin.

"
"
Work on the top knot.,
Shape the foot palms.,
Finish grooming the tail.",How to Do a Palm Springs on a Poodle3," To shape the top knot (hair on the head), comb the hair down over the eyes and take your curve scissor and cut the hair till you see the eyes then from the corner of the eye to outer ear cut the hanging hair off and blend it into the top of the ear and shape the hair to round it off and blend it in to the back of the neck.Use the rounded scissors to shape the top palm into the desired height, length, and overall look.

, To shape the palms, this should be the last part to be done. You should have four legs with hair at the top of the foot to the big joint were the dog would bend its foot and shave the hair off the foot to where the foot is clean.To start the palms, you want to comb the hair down and make your first cut to where you shaved the top of the foot to the line where you stopped. Use your curved scissors and scissor the palm to the back so the hair doesn't lay on the ground. Do the same on the top of the palm and do the same thing to the other three palms.
Now you should four round balls of hair just above your dog’s paws on a standard poodle the palms should be the size of a grapefruit the palm would be smaller depending on the dog.

, For the Palm Springs cut, the poodle’s tail should have pom on it. You can determine how fluffy you want the pom to be, but you need one. Use the clippers to shave up from the base of the tail where you already shaved. The pom should get bigger at the tip of the tail and be shaved closer toward the base.


Be sure to use the clippers to taper the hair so that the pom can get slightly larger at the end of the tail.

"
"
Avoid nicking sensitive areas.,
Keep an eye on the clipper blade.,
Monitor your dog’s demeanor.,
Allow for errors.",How to Do a Palm Springs on a Poodle4," Just like humans, dogs have certain areas that are more delicate and sensitive than others. When grooming your poodle, be extra careful around these specific areas to avoid hurting the dog and making it bleed.These sensitive spots include the eyes, nipples, lips, and ears.

, Clipper blades can heat up fairly quickly while being used. If you aren’t careful, it’s possible that you could burn your poodle’s skin with the metal blades. While using the clippers, pause every couple of minutes to turn the clippers off so you can safely check the temperature of the blades. If it feels hot to the touch, you should wait a few minutes until the blades cool down before continuing.Don’t try to feel the blades while the clippers are in use as this could cause you to cut yourself.

, You don’t want your dog to be scared or nervous during the grooming process, so make sure you talk to the dog and pet it to keep the dog calm while you’re grooming it. Try to watch for signs of nervousness like whimpering, jerking away, darting eyes, and crouching down. If your dog does any of these things, take a moment to comfort it and reassure the dog nothing bad will happen.If your dog is squirming too much, you may want help it expel some energy before you begin grooming. Take your dog for a walk or run around with it in the backyard.
To make sure your dog is as comfortable as possible during the grooming experience, be sure to let it outside to go to the bathroom before you start. Grooming can take a while and you don’t want your dog to be uncomfortable because it needs to go outside.

, If you make a mistake while grooming, try to even it out on the other side. For example, if you cut the hair shorter than you intended to on one pom, try to even it out on the other side if there is a corresponding one. If you make a mistake in a more noticeable place, like the top knot, just go with the flow and let your dog’s top knot be a bit smaller this time. It will grow back out soon and you’ll be able to fix it.


If you can’t even it out, then just get it as close as possible and give the hair some time to grow back out. No matter how big the mistake may seem to you, don’t stress about it because it’ll just be a week or two before the hair will be long enough again to fix the problem.

Secure your poodle.,
Shave a line down your poodle’s back.,
Shave a horizontal line.,
Create an angled line.,
Trim the body.",How to Do a Banded Dutch on a Poodle2," Before you begin clipping the back lines, secure your poodle at the front by placing your hand on your dog’s neck. If your dog has trouble standing still, use a slide collar to secure your dog. Attach the slide collar to a table or a cupboard to secure your poodle.Your dog should be standing throughout the entire process.

, Standing at the rear of your dog, use a clipper with a number 10 blade to shave a vertical line down your dog’s back. The vertical line should start between your poodle’s shoulder blades, i.e., at the base of the neck band, and continue down to the base of its tail. To set the straight line, go over the line again with your clippers.Make sure your poodle is standing completely straight throughout the process.
A number 10 blade is appropriate for standard poodles. If you have a smaller poodle, use a narrower toe blade instead.

, Starting at your dog’s last rib, shave a horizontal line down your dog’s right side. The line should end at your poodle’s underside. Go over the line once more with your clippers.Placement of this line will depend on the size of your dog. On very long dogs, this line will be a bit more forward in comparison to dogs with shorter backs.

, Once you have completed the horizontal line behind your dog’s last rib, create an angled line. Create the angled line by clipping the corners of the pattern, i.e., where the vertical and horizontal lines meet.Repeat steps three and four on the left side of your dog. Once both sides are shaved, the lines should resemble a cross when viewing your dog from above.

, Use a snap on ""E"" comb to trim your poodle’s body. Trim just enough so that the lines a more visible. Then, create a “bevel” on your poodle’s patterned lines. Create a ""bevel"" by combing the longer coat over the clipped lines. Scissor the edges of the coat."
"
Clip the paws.,
Shave the tail.,
Shape the coat.",How to Do a Banded Dutch on a Poodle3," Hold your poodle’s paw by placing your hand around the cuff. Use a number 40 blade to clip the coat around your dog’s paws. Clip the hair around your dog’s toes, as well as the hair on top of the foot.When shaving the paws, use light pressure to avoid digging the blade into the skin.

, Similar to the cut between the eyes, clip an inverted “V” at the croup. The croup is the muscular area on your dog’s rump, i.e., before the onset of the tail. Then, clip a two to three inch band at the base of the tail. Make sure the band goes all the way around the tail.

, Use curved and straight shears to shape the rest of the coat. Use curved shears for curved lines and straight sheers for straight lines. Follow the natural lines of the dog’s body when shearing the coat. Use the shears to shape the hair on your poodle’s hips and legs (insides and outsides), rump, sides and undersides, front, and end of the tail."

Use a child’s toothbrush on your dog’s teeth.,
Use dog toothpaste.,
Gently brush the outside surface of the teeth.,
Give your dog a dental chew every day.",How to Care for a Toy Poodle4," Toy poodles are notorious for developing dental tartar. This buildup can cause smelly breath and promotes gum recession and tooth loss. To brush his teeth, use a soft child's toothbrush.


You can also use a finger brush, which is available from your vet or a major pet retailer).
You can reduce dental tartar buildup by feeding dry food to your dog. Eating wet food can create more dental problems. If your dog eats wet food, get into the habit of brushing your dog's teeth every day., Toothpaste specially made for dogs can be purchased at pet stores.Never use human toothpaste on a dog. If the dog swallows toothpaste ingredients such as fluoride, he can get an upset stomach.

, Use a small amount of toothpaste on the toothbrush. Position the dog’s head so that you can brush his teeth.

, If your dog is does not let you brush his teeth, give him a dental chew daily. This helps clean the chewing teeth (the molars) at the back of the mouth.


It is worth investing time and effort into keeping your pet's teeth clean in order to reduce the number of dental cleanings your pet may need.

Monitor your puppy's breathing.",How to Take Care of an English Bulldog Puppy," Buy a small supply of the food your dog has been fed before you brought it home. That way, your puppy's system won't go into shock due to a totally new food. If you want to change brands, do so slowly. Mix 1/2 and 1/2 for a week, then 1/4 and 3/4 for a week, then full change over.;
, You should feed it three times a day on a regular schedule for the first four months after arrival. At 6 months you can start to cut back to 2 times a day and at 12 months you can cut it back further, to once a day.

, Usually readily available commercial food is fine for your puppy. Examine the first five ingredients on the dog food label; the first one or two ingredients should be meat (not meat by products which are fine but they should be further down the list) followed by vegetables, and then grains.


Once in a while a English bulldog will have signs of food intolerance (diarrhea, vomiting or skin problems) to one or more of the ingredients in a food. If your puppy or dog shows these signs, you will need to work with your veterinarian to determine the cause and then follow a strict lifelong diet to minimize symptoms.

, Keep in mind that there are certain human foods that can make a dog sick or outright kill it.Foods that at toxic to dogs include (but are not limited to):


Avocados
Alcohol
Chocolate
Grapes and raisins
Chives, onions and garlic
Nuts
Yeast doughs
Anything made with the sweetener xylitol especially found in sugar free gums

, English bulldogs can put on weight easily, so you need to watch that your puppy doesn’t get overweight. If your puppy is putting on too much weight, consult with your veterinarian about the best, and safest, way to keep your dog's weight in balance.


Remember treats add calories to the diet so they should be fed in tiny amounts and sparingly. Reserve these for when your puppy is training.
Monitor your bulldog’s body condition score (BCS) to determine if it is overweight (or underweight) on a monthly basis. A normal weight dog will have a “tucked” abdomen (when viewed from the side) and its ribs will be easily felt but not seen. A fat dog will lose the abdomen tuck, as fat accumulates here and on the ribs cage. An underweight dog will have a more extreme abdomen tuck and its ribs will both be easily felt and easily seen.

, This is especially important in hot or humid weather but should be provided all of the time. Also remember to wash out food and water bowls with soap and water a couple times a week, as bulldogs can be quite slobbery.

, Please be sure to provide many chew toys to help with this transitional period. Cow hooves can be found at many pet stores and are recommended. Stay away from pig ears and cheap rawhide, and ""greenies,"" as these can cause severe diarrhea, bloat, and are a choking hazard.

, For instance, keep an eye out for diarrhea if you change your pup's food. If your bulldog develops diarrhea then stop all food for 12 hours. If it persists for more than 24 hours, contact your veterinarian immediately to prevent dehydration. Puppies can dehydrate very rapidly so you need to take it seriously when diarrhea occurs.

, Dogs can pick up some unwanted guests: ticks, fleas, mites, lice, and intestinal worms. Your dog can be the perfect host for these pests if regular treatment for these nasty pests is not given. Your veterinarian is the best source of knowledge for the local bugs that bug the local dog population and how to prevent these pests.


Heartworm is a widespread disease present spread by mosquitoes throughout most of the United States.A yearly blood test is taken to make sure the dog isn’t infected with this nasty parasite, then a monthly tablet or a shot which lasts for up to 6 months is used to kill any organisms present in the blood stream. There is a treatment for heartworm, but it is expensive and takes a toll physically on the dog and can take months to combat.
Another vaccination to consider, especially if you live in an endemic area, is the Lyme’s disease vaccination. This is especially important for dogs that spend a lot of time outside, that live on farms, or that hunt, as they are at increased risk of contracting this tick borne disease. In addition to joint pain, swelling, and fevers, dogs can also get a generally fatal kidney disease as the consequence of contracting Lyme’s disease.

, Puppies will generally have a first veterinary visit at the age of six weeks by the person who has the mother dog. The veterinarian will examine the puppies to make sure there are no hernias, heart, lung, or eye or ear problems in any of the pups. Generally they will be de-wormed at this time and be given their first puppy shot (the distemper” vaccine). At 9 weeks, and then again at 12 weeks, the de-wormer and distemper vaccines will be repeated. Then these can be given once a year or on a schedule determined by you and your veterinarian.At the twelve weeks visit the rabies vaccination will be given—although this may vary depending on local laws. This vaccination is required by many communities. There can sometimes be severe penalties if your dog is not rabies vaccinated especially if the dog bites a person or another pet.
As your dog ages, more frequent examinations will need to be given. Twice yearly examination will catch medical issues before they become big problems. Older dogs frequently suffer from arthritis and heart disease just like elderly humans. There are effective and safe treatments which can help your older dog live a reasonably pain free and pleasant golden years.

, It is important to spay (females) or neuter (male) your puppy. In addition to various health benefits for the dog (decreased chances of certain tumors and infections) there is a big societal benefit in the decreased number of unwanted dogs. Microchipping is also encouraged in case your dog ever becomes lost.

, The inner ear part of the ear is normally white or darker colored, usually corresponding to the color of the dog's coat, so look for discoloring. The puppy's ears should also not smell nor have any discharge in the ear or on the flap. The ear should be free of debris, dirt, or parasites, like ticks or mites. Any of the following are abnormal:Scratching or pawing the ear.
Shaking the head excessively.
Waxy, fluid or brown discharge from the ear.

, You can clean the ears using a product specifically made to clean dog’s ears, hydrogen peroxide (squeeze out extra fluid), or with a solution of half white vinegar and half rubbing alcohol.Saturate a cotton ball with the fluid and gently wipe it in the dog’s ear. If in doubt, or if you suspect an ear infection, have your veterinarian look in the ear using an otoscope to examine the ear drum.


Never stick a q-tip or similar type of product into the ear canal. A dog’s ear canal takes a sharp turn when it meets the head. You will not be able to see the entire ear canal and should not try to put anything down in there.

, It also gives you a great opportunity to examine your dog’s mouth for loose or damaged teeth, sores, growths, or any unusual things, and bring them to your veterinarian’s attention at an early stage before they become big problems.


Never use a human toothpaste on a dog; only use dental toothpaste made for dogs. The fluoride in human toothpaste is poisonous to dogs and can cause serious health problems.
Place a little puppy toothpaste on your finger tip and let your puppy lick it off. The next day put it on your finger and rub it along the outer gums. Then try to put a little on a dog toothbrush, let the puppy lick it then run the tooth brush along the outer edges of the teeth and gums. Only the outer part (against the cheeks) need to be brushed. It should only take about 30 seconds to brush the puppy’s teeth.
Even with regular tooth brushing, dogs may need dental cleanings once in a while. Plaque and bacteria can build up under the gum line causing problems there or in the roots of the teeth. Just like with their human owner’s, regular mouth examinations by their doggy dentist should be done once a year.

, Because of the English bulldog's skin folds, especially those on the face and around the lips, will need to be carefully examined each day for signs of infection. Normal yeast found on the body will thrive and flourish in these dark, warm, and moist crevices. These should be gently washed and thoroughly dried at least every other day, more often in those dogs prone to infections.

, The English bulldog’s short hair coat will shed so a thorough brushing once a week with a soft bristled brush is recommended. While you’re grooming, keep an eye open for any fleas, ticks, or mites, along with any lumps, bumps, or cysts on the skin. These, along with any scabs, redness, or itchy skin, should be brought to your veterinarian’s attention.

, Brushing time is a good time to look at the nails and paws. The nails might need to be clipped. If you haven’t performed this before ask you veterinarian technician to demonstrate. The procedure needs to be done correctly so you don’t trim the “quick,” or the part of the nail where the blood vessels and nerves are.


Once a dog has been “quicked,” or the quick has been cut, it will be hard to trim your puppy's nails, due to fear of pain and bleeding.

, Puppies will naturally follow a pack leader and you need to be that leader. As its leader, you need to be teach the puppy how to behave and fit into their new environment. They are not baby geniuses, nor are they mind readers. They need patience and repetition with much positive reinforcement. If you cannot handle a problem that you are encountering, contact a local professional canine behavior specialist.

, You will want to teach the puppy to sit, stay, and come on command. In addition, it is also important to begin house training your puppy early on.All of this training is most successful when you use positive reinforcement with your puppy. Instead of punishing your puppy when it doesn't do the right thing, you need to make it a pleasurable experience when it does the right thing. Give your dog a treat (either a snack or praise and love) when it follows your directions and it will make the puppy want to do what you say!


Teaching your puppy to heel while walking on a leash is also important. Not only is it a good way for your puppy to learn direction, it also gives them exercise and socialization out in the world. Just be sure not to walk your puppy too much. Little puppies get pooped out really easily, so don't walk them into the ground.

, Socialization is very important to make sure your puppy gets along well with other dogs, other animals, and humans. Younger puppies under the age of 14-16 weeks are most amenable to socialization, as after this age they become more wary of new situations, humans, and other animals.


Get your puppy used to riding in the car and walking around the neighborhood. You should also get it used to humans of all ages, sizes, colors and genders (safely and in a friendly way). Also make sure to safely introduce him to friendly dogs and cats.
A great way to introduce the puppy to people and dogs is at puppy socialization or obedience classes held at large pet stores, veterinary clinics or through community courses.

, You need to create a bond of love and trust between you and your new puppy. While it's important for the puppy to follow your commands, it's also important for the puppy to feel that you love and care for it. Spend quality time with your new puppy every day, making sure that most of it is playing and cuddling, and not all structured training.

, These puppies are temperature sensitive. They can suffer from heat stroke very easily but are also sensitive to the cold.


Be sure to keep your puppy cool enough in summer months. Any temperature of 90 degrees or above can be very dangerous. If you take your the puppy out during a hot day, be sure to wet it down and provide unlimited water to drink.
Keep the puppy's time out to a minimum during extreme heat.
Bulldog puppies can get cold very easily. Be sure to keep it in a warm environment during colder months to avoid catching a cold. During winter months, it may be necessary to keep the puppy warm by using a sweater or sweatshirt and doggie booties while outside. It should not be kept in temperatures of 60 degrees or less for extended periods of time.

, As with other popular breeds, bulldogs are genetically predisposed to Atopic Dermatitis, which is a skin condition that results in irritation on the skin.Research indicates that of the 30% of canines who do suffer from allergies, 85% suffer from allergy to pollens, mites & mold spores. Consult with your veterinarian about solutions if your puppy's skin becomes red and irritated.

, Because of their short muzzle (nose), bulldogs are prone to respiratory and breathing difficulties. Hot weather, humid weather, too much strenuous exercise, and any illness affecting the nose, throat, or lung will make it hard for your bulldog to get enough air into its body. Bring your puppy into an air conditioned room during hot or humid weather and only exercise it inside during extremes of weather.


If your bulldog starts to pant it is time to end the exercise and give it a breather.

Teach your puppy to stop biting.,
Use positive reinforcement.,
Let your puppy know you're in control.",How to Take Care of a Pitbull Puppy1," You should begin reading up on training your pit bull before you get him. This way, you can immediately train and socialize your puppy once you bring him home. If you get your puppy from a good breeder, the breeder might have started socializing your pit bull. This way, your puppy is already exposed to new situations, sounds, people, and animals.Consider hiring a qualified, experienced dog trainer to interact and teach your dog manners.;
, Teach your puppy a few basic commands (like ""come,"" ""sit,"" ""stay""). This way, when you notice your puppy engaging in bad behavior, you can immediately redirect his attention. For example, if you notice your puppy running up and jumping on someone, you can quickly command him to ""come."" He should stop jumping up on the person and come to you instead.Teaching your puppy a few simple commands can also keep him safe. If he's about to do something dangerous, like run into traffic, you can command him to ""sit"" or ""stay"" so that you can reach him.

, Many puppies will mouth or nip when playing. They need to learn bite inhibition, especially when playing so they know it's never okay to bite. There are several ways you can teach bite inhibition. But, often just saying “ouch” firmly and then stopping puppy play signals to your puppy that biting is not acceptable.Instead of letting your puppy play with your hands, offer toys that you can teach your pit bull to release.
You can also place your puppy in time out immediately after nipping. This will help him settle down and tell him that biting is inappropriate.

, When you're training, never get mad at your pit bull. Animals don't understand punishment and will instead learn to fear you. Puppies will make mistakes when learning new things, so be patient. You should always look for a reason to praise your puppy, even if only for small steps or achievements.For example, give your puppy a treat when he's calm instead of punishing him when he's being hyper.

, You may want to make your puppy repeat certain actions or commands, especially if he didn't obey. This signals to your pit bull that he didn't do something correctly and needs to keep trying until he succeeds. Let him rest once he gets close to completing the command. Give your pit bull plenty of chances to follow your commands.


Your puppy should get used to you handling his feet, ears, tail, and body. This signals that you're in control and will make it easier to groom your puppy, administer medications, and clip his nails.

Take younger dogs to the vet annually.,
Take aging dogs to the vet every 6 months.,
Get your dog vaccinated, wormed and treated for parasites.,
Spay a female toy poodle.,
Monitor your aging dog for illnesses.",How to Care for a Toy Poodle5," Monitoring your dog’s health rests in part with making regular visits to the veterinarian. For dogs under the age of 7 years, visit your vet every year. The vet will check for signs of illness, keep them up to date on vaccines, and will treat your dog for parasites and worms.

, Dogs that are over the age of 7 years should visit the vet every 6 months. The vet will check for signs of illness, keep them up to date on vaccines, and will treat for parasites and worms.

, Responsible dog owners get their pets vaccinated regularly, wormed, and treated for parasites such as fleas.


Vaccination is essential even if you carry your toy poodle everywhere, or he rarely goes outside. This is because some infections such as parvovirus are caused by particularly hardy viruses that can attach to your shoes. Therefore, they can still pose a risk to even the most pampered of poodles.
Talk with your vet about implanting a microchip in your dog. A microchip will help you track the dog if he gets lost.

, One of the health problems that toy poodles are prone to in later life is diabetes mellitus (sugar diabetes). The hormones associated with estrous (heat) in the female can trigger diabetes. Therefore, it is wise to get your female toy poodle spayed.


If spaying is done before the female’s second heat, this also has a beneficial effect in vastly reducing her risk of developing mammary cancer in later life. Toy poodles often live into their teens. Each time a bitch has a season, it weakens the lining of her womb and makes her more likely to develop a pyometra, which is a potentially life-threatening womb infection. Thus, spaying whilst she is fit and strong removes the possibility of needing emergency surgery in later life when anesthesia can pose a higher risk.Neutering a male toy poodle does not give the same compelling health benefits. Neutering a male is mainly done to prevent unwanted breeding and to control behavioral issues such as aggression or dominance.
Talk with your vet to learn more. Discussing your dog’s health with your vet will give you a good idea about which direction to take.

, Small but resilient, toy poodles often live well into double figures. They do however tend to suffer from health issues as they age. Diabetes, poor teeth and heart disease are most common. These issues, once identified, can often be managed in order to help your pet live a long and active life.Watch for signs that indicate a problem, such as increased thirst, urinary accidents, coughing, lack of energy, bad breath, difficulty chewing, or weight loss. If you see any of these symptoms, speak to your vet."

Train your dog to sit and stay.,
Train your dog to come when called.,
Give rewards for good behavior.,
Train your dog to spend time on his own.,
Play with your dog every day.",How to Care for a Toy Poodle6," Toy poodles are highly intelligent and love the mental stimulation of dog training. Every time you feed your dog, give him commands to sit and stay before putting his food dish down. Once he sits and stays, then put the dish down. Saying these commands every time will soon train the dog to sit and stay without the added reward of food.

, When you are at home, spend at least a couple of minutes every hour teaching your puppy his name. Do this by calling his name. When he responds and runs to you, repeat his name and then give him a treat., All training should be reward-based, which means ignoring bad behavior and rewarding the good. Do not be tempted to scold your puppy because your attention is a reward in itself. Instead, ignore the bad behavior and encourage him to do something good.


For example, call him to you and when he comes, give him a treat. , Toy poodles become very bonded to their owner and can suffer from separation anxiety when left alone. To prevent this, train your puppy to spend time on his own at an early age. This can be something simple like leaving him in his crate for ten minutes while you stay in another room, or get him used to being home alone while you go out to run errands., Toy poodles thrive on mental stimulation, so put aside at least 20 minutes twice a day to play with your dog.


Give your dog some dog puzzles to keep him occupied. These are available in major pet retailers or online).Many toy poodles will enjoy pursuits such as agility training on circuits adapted to small breeds."

Microchip and place a collar on your puppy.,
Feed your pit bull a nutritious diet.,
Get your puppy regular medical care and vaccinations.,
Get your puppy plenty of exercise.,
Keep your puppy mentally stimulated.",How to Take Care of a Pitbull Puppy2," Get an identifying microchip inserted below your pit bulls skin and put a collar with an identification tag around his neck. These will make it easier to locate your puppy if he gets lost. Pit bulls are good at escaping their yards, so microchipping is important. Consider asking humane societies to microchip, since some offer low-cost microchipping.Make sure your yard is secure, ideally with at least a six foot solid fence. Chain link fences can be climbed and they are not a visual deterrent to other animals or humans bothering your pet.

, Talk with your veterinarian about choosing a high-quality food for your puppy. Avoid commercial foods that list low-quality ingredients like meat by-products and grains. Instead, choose one that immediately lists a meat.Offer your puppy several regular meals throughout the day instead constantly leaving a full dish of food out.


Read the package or ask your vet about a specific amount of food to feed your puppy each day.

, Talk with the veterinarian about spaying or neutering your puppy to prevent unexpected litters and ask about treating your puppy for worms. Your puppy will also need the basic vaccinations that all puppies get, starting at 8 weeks old. A booster should be given 3 or 4 weeks later. Any other vaccines that your vet recommends will need to be boosted every year.Your puppy should have his first veterinary exam before you bring him home. After that, make sure he sees the vet every year.
Check local laws to determine a rabies vaccine requirement. Most rabies vaccines are started at 12 weeks old and Lyme disease vaccines begin at 9 weeks followed by a booster 3 to 4 weeks later.

, Try to take your puppy for short walks (less than 15 minutes) if he's less than 3 months old. You'll want to walk him at least twice a day, even as a puppy. Exercise is important to keep him healthy, burn energy, and make him happy and engaged. If you can, let your puppy exercise in an area with lots of space. This gives him the freedom to run around.


Playing fetch is a great way to interact with your puppy while he gets some exercise., Offer your puppy kibble, toys, and treats while you do training exercises. For example, you might bury treats and let your pit bull dig them up. This will let him use up energy and engage his brain. Or, you can let him play with puzzle toys that release kibble. This will keep your pit bull from becoming bored and destructive.Pit bulls are highly intelligent and can become destructive if left with nothing to do. Don't leave your puppy alone for too long. If you must, leave him in an enclosed area like a crate or pen with plenty of toys.

Introduce your puppy to new people and situations.,
Make sure your puppy is comfortable.,
Enroll your pit bull in socialization classes.,
Supervise interactions with other dogs.",How to Take Care of a Pitbull Puppy3," Start introducing your pit bull to different people and animals as early as you can. This will help your puppy get used to all sorts of people and animals.The best time to start socializing your puppy is when he's around 3 to 5 weeks old to when he is 14 to 16 weeks old. During this time, your puppy easily learns and absorbs new information which can make him confident later in life.


Give your pit bull treats as a reward for greeting people. You can let others feed your puppy the treats so that he associates people with good things.
Treats can also keep your puppy's attention around loud or possibly frightening situations like traffic, skateboards and bicycles.

, Your pit bull puppy might be frightened when meeting new people or encountering new situations. Put him at ease by starting with calm, comfortable situations before gradually introducing more exciting situations. Watch your puppy for signs that he's content. Never force your dog into an interaction that seems to overwhelm or frighten him.For example, if your puppy appears frightened by meeting new people out in public, try introducing people to him at home. Your puppy may be more relaxed in this environment. Eventually, you can expose him to new things outside of the home.

, One of the best ways to socialize your puppy is to take a puppy socialization class with your puppy.You could find a responsible pit bull dog group, canine good citizen program, or dog therapy training program. These classes can give you skills you need to teach your puppy commands and help your puppy interact with other dogs.


You can find available programs through community education centers, humane societies, and large pet stores. Your veterinarian may also be able to recommend local classes., You should always watch your puppy when he's playing with other puppies or dogs. If you notice a problem, stop the behavior before they start fighting. For example, play has moved too far towards fighting if one puppy is biting another's skin,especially if the biting puppy is shaking his head and pinning the other to the ground.Once you stop the fighting and the puppies calm down, reward them and let them play again.


To easily interrupt fighting, keep both puppies on six-foot leashes. Or, keep blast horns and squirt bottles around to quickly interrupt fighting.
If your puppy doesn't often fight with other puppies, you can practice commands. For example, call your puppy to you and reward him when he obeys.

These can manifest in physical ways, which will change her behavior. Look for muscle weakness, which may show up as shaking or trembling. She may also stop being able to jump or play.


She may also have a decreased energy level, depression, and overall lethargy. This will cause her to sit or lay around without moving much or playing. She may also be less interested in you, in your family, in playing, or other activities she used to love.
She may also seem restless and won't settle down, which is likely due to a stomach issue.
It is also possible that she may lose her fur.
In some cases, Addison's Disease may cause your Poodle to collapse.;
, Addison's Disease can also manifest through her eating and drinking habits. Your dog may start vomiting or have diarrhea, which are some of the most common and frequent symptoms of this condition. She may loose her appetite but have an increase in her thirst. This will likely cause increased urination.


She may lose weight because of her decrease in appetite.
She may also have blood in her stool., If you notice more than one of these symptoms in your dog, you should keep track of them. Your vet will want to know what your Poodle's symptom history is and how often they have occurred. It is important to note how long the symptoms last and if the time between them and length of their occurrence change over time.


This will help paint a full picture of your Poodle's disease as help your vet treat her.

, The symptoms associated with Addison's Disease are mild in the early stages of the disease. They also tend to come and go, which can make it hard to diagnose in this stage. This means that your dog may have episodes where the symptoms occur and then they will clear up after a day or two. The symptoms may also come in waves, where she will have one symptom for a few days, then that one will clear up as another develops.


This is most common with the gastric symptoms, such as vomiting and diarrhea. These symptoms will clear up, only to be replaced with muscle weakness or depression.
Your Poodle's health may be slow to deteriorate, which means that the symptoms will get progressively more intense and sporadic, which will eventually lead to symptoms severe enough that she collapses. This can take weeks to months to happen. Try to take her to the vet before she reaches this stage., The best and most standard test for Addison's Disease is the ACTH stimulation test. This test will gauge how well your dog's adrenal system works and show if the section of the adrenal system that is uniquely affected by Addison's Disease is damaged. The aim of this test is to take a base level blood sample while your dog is at rest to get her resting level of cortisol, which is a stress hormone. She will then be given an injection of synacthen, a hormone used to force her adrenal gland to produce more cortisol.


About one hour after this injection, another blood sample will be taken to show her new level of cortisol after the gland was stimulated.
If your dog has Addison's disease, the adrenal gland will be damaged, which means it will not respond to the injection. This means that her cortisol levels will be the same before and after the injection, proving she has Addison's Disease., If your vet isn't sure about Addison's Disease, he may want to take a blood sample from your Poodle to run an overall screening panel to check her levels. He will be looking for her overall organ health, specific mineral levels, signs of anemia, and her red and white blood cell count.


Addison's Disease can cause a shift in certain mineral levels in her blood stream, including lower levels of chloride and sodium. Any significant shift in the sodium and potassium ration in her blood will help determine Addison's Disease.This test will also help rule out other diseases and point your vet in the direction of Addison's disease., In some cases, your vet will x-ray your Poodle to help rule out other problems, such as a gastrointestinal blockage due to a foreign object, which can cause vomiting and diarrhea. It may also show her heart, which can show if there is a reduced blood volume in her heart caused by the Addison's Disease.


This heart shrinkage is due to a reduced blood volume brought on by dehydration and a reductions volume of circulating blood in her system., Addison's Disease is known as hypoadrenalism  or hypocortisolism. It is also called the great pretender because it is a disease that, in its early stages, mimics many other mild, common problems. This makes it very dangerous because Addison's Disease can be extremely serious, in which Poodles with severe cases can go into shock and die.Addison's Disease is most common in young to middle aged dogs, which is when she is a puppy until she is around five years old. It is also most common in female dogs., Addison's Disease causes the body to stop making mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids, which are substances your Poodle needs to deal with the stresses she undergoes every day. These also help regulate multiple normal bodily functions., The decrease in mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid production from Addison's Disease develops because of damage to your dog's adrenal glands, which produce these hormones. This damage is most commonly due to an autoimmune disease, which is when your dog's immune system works to destroy her own glandular tissue


Other causes of Addison's Disease may include trauma to her abdomen or drug-induced disease, which is not necessarily a common cause for poodles, Addison's Disease is treatable once you diagnose the condition. Once your vet ensures that your Poodle has the condition, he will give you oral tablets to give your Poodle that will replace the missing glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid. Your dog may instead require hormone replacement through injections, which will have to be administered by your vet every three to four weeks.


You will also have to add a salt supplement to your dog's diet, which will help with the underlying salt deficiency caused by Addison's Disease.
These two medications will help return your dog's life to normal., Your dog may suffer from an acute episode of Addison's Disease, which is a sudden and severe onset of the symptoms. If this occurs, she needs treatment immediately. She will be hospitalized and the treatment will depend on how severe and which specific symptoms your dog has. She will likely receive instant treatment with intravenous hormones and fluids. If she does not get help immediately, she may go into shock and die.


After these episodes, it is likely your dog will need hormone replacement therapy for the rest of her life."

Pay attention to signs of pain near the eyes.,
Look for eye enlargement.,
Pay attention to any discharge coming from the eye.,
Inspect the actual eye.,
Look at the dog's pupils for unusual dilation.,
Test your dog for blindness.,
Take your dog in for an exam.,
Get a clear diagnosis from your veterinarian.,
Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for treatment.,
Learn about eye pressure and glaucoma.,
Understand the different ways glaucoma can advance.,
Look in to the different causes of glaucoma.",How to Diagnose Glaucoma in Poodles," Your poodle may be rubbing its eyes excessively with a paw or rubbing its face along the ground. It may also be keeping its eyes partially shut or completely shut. Another sign of eye discomfort is if the dog is unhappy if you try to touch its face near its eyes.The signs of discomfort can be very subtle and hard to read. They mostly show up in changes in temperament and activity.;
, The eye with glaucoma will be physically larger than normal. This is because it is stretched by the additional pressure inside. If in doubt, compare one eye with the other to see if one of the eyes is enlarged.

, There may particularly be discharge from an enlarged eye. This is due to the combination of pressure in the eye and problems with drainage.


To spot drainage, look for dampness on one cheek, while the other is dry.

, Be on the look out for inflamed white of the eyes. The white part of the eye may become red and have inflamed blood vessels tracking across it. There may also be cloudiness of the cornea. The surface of the eye is normal transparent but when it is stretched it takes on a cloudy or milky appearance., Check one eye against the other to determine if one pupil is larger. The dilated pupil is the abnormal side.


You can also keep an eye out for fixed or sluggish pupils. Glaucoma can affect how the pupils react to light in a variety of ways., If only one eye has glaucoma, then the dog may mask the lack of vision by compensating with the good eye. Try waving a finger close to the eye you are concerned about and see if the dog blinks or not.


Be careful not to touch the dog's whiskers in the process, as this may make it blink even if it has lost vision in the eye.

, The vet will first perform a physical exam of the dog, including checking the appearance of the eyes and making sure that both eyes are the same size. The vet may also gently feel the size of each eyeball through the eyelids, comparing one side with the other to see if there is a difference. The dog's response to this test may also tell the vet if one eye is painful or uncomfortable when compared with the other.The vet will also shine a bright light at the retina to see if the pupil contracts. This will help the clinician determine if the dog is blind or not. The vet may move a fingertip close to the eye to check if the dog sees the threat or not.
The vet then examines the internal structure of the eye using an ophthalmoscope. The vet looks for signs of inflammation in the iris, which could provide an explanation for the development of glaucoma. He or she will also look at the drainage angle between the iris and the cornea to see if it is narrow, which is a predisposing factor in the miniature poodle.

, To give a definitive diagnosis of glaucoma the vet uses a tonometer. This is a device that measures the pressure within the eye. This test is uncomfortable for some dogs and so the vet may put a few drops of local anesthetic into the eye ahead of the test.Eye pressure in the dog ranges from 12 - 16 mmHg. It is generally considered valid to diagnose glaucoma if the pressure rises above 24 mmHg., Treatment of glaucoma is difficult. Caught early, glaucoma can be controlled using drops which decrease the amount of aqueous humor produced.In addition, there are specialist surgical procedures that aid the drainage of fluid from the eye. Your veterinarian will suggest the best treatment based on the progression of the illness and how pain and vision loss can be managed.In late stage glaucoma the eyesight may be too damaged to restore. However, drops can help decrease the pressure and keep the eye comfortable.
Alternatively, removing an eye that doesn't have vision anymore can improve the dog's quality of life.
Unfortunately, most dogs diagnosed with glaucoma will eventually go blind, even if surgery or medicine lengthen the amount of time they have sight., Glaucoma is a rise in the pressure within the eye (the intraocular pressure), which causes damage to the retina and can lead to blindness. A normal eye is round and the tough shell of the eye is maintained in a circle because it contains fluid under pressure. This fluid is called the aqueous humor. The aqueous humor is not a static volume of fluid, but is being constantly produced and drained away. In glaucoma the aqueous humor is impeded from draining away. Because it is still being produced but has nowhere to go, this leads to a buildup of pressure within the eye.If the pressure becomes high enough, it compresses the retina, damages the delicate cells, and the dog becomes blind.

, There are two different ways that glaucoma can come on: fast or slow. Glaucoma that advances quickly can have eye pressure that spikes over a few hours or days and causes severe sudden illness. The other way glaucoma can progress is slowly, over weeks and months. This type of progression is harder it diagnose, as the signs of the illness come on very gradually., Glaucoma can come on due to disease, trauma to the eye, or due to genetic abnormalities. The most common causes in dogs include disease and trauma to the eye. Diseases causing glaucoma include internal inflammation, dislocation of the lens, tumors, and internal bleeding.In miniature poodles there is a slight genetic tendency towards 'closed angle' glaucoma. This term describes the fact that the angle between the iris and the back of the cornea is too tight. This is the area where the aqueous humor drains away and if the angle is too tight it forms a poor drain, leading to a buildup of fluid and thus glaucoma."

A puppy not huddled up with littermates and his mother will not get the food or warmth that he needs to thrive.;
, A newborn puppy can become a weak puppy within a matter of hours. There are certain signs to check for to see if your puppy is having serious problems such as:Cold to the touch or cold mouth
Weak suckle reflex when the fingertip is gently placed in mouth
Limp or poor muscle tone: head hangs down and legs don’t pull back when lightly tugged
Inability to nurse
Feces on the rear: can indicate diarrhea (a serious issue)
Discharge from the umbilical stump
Non-stop crying

, You should check all your puppies’ weights on a suitable scale twice a day. Kitchen scales will do, as long as you clean them well afterwards or even use them just for puppy weigh-ins. The weight can be taken in grams or ounces, just be consistent. They should never lose weight, instead they should gain about 10% of their birth weight each day after the first day of life.This indicates they are getting enough milk.


Weights should be recorded in a notebook or spreadsheet so you can track their progress for the first two weeks of life.

, If you’ve determined a puppy in the litter needs special care, the first move is to make sure it is warm enough. A cold puppy is not able to nurse and can become dangerously dehydrated and hypoglycemic, which means having life-threatening low blood sugar.Warming can be accomplished by using a hot water bottle filled with very warm water, 'not' boiling water, placed in the bottom of a small cardboard box or shoe box and covering it with a towel. The puppy can then be placed on the towel, covered with a light cloth or towel and the top of the box can be lightly closed.
Alternatively, you can place the puppy on your chest under your clothing until it warms up. You may want to wrap the rear end in a clean piece of cloth so you're not urinated or pooped on! Puppy's tiny claws will be sharp as well, so be prepared for a few scratches.
Using a heating pad is dangerous, as they can overheat a puppy. Even on the lowest setting, a heating pad can become dangerously hot. You want to gradually warm the puppy over a course of one to three hours. Warming any more rapidly can cause overheating.There are heating pads made specifically for animals, and these usually don't get as hot. The puppy must not be placed directly on this pad — you must use a towel or fleecy cover between the pad and the puppy in order to avoid thermal burns.
If the puppy is open-mouth panting, she is too hot.

, After you think the puppy is warmed you should use a pediatric digital thermometer to take the puppy’s temperature rectally. Place a small amount of lubricant on the tip and gently insert the very tip into the pup’s rectum.


If the body temperature is below 94 °F (34.4 °C) the gastrointestinal tract will not work properly. However, don’t let the rectal temperature get over 99 °F (37.2 °C) in a puppy less than seven days or overheating can occur.
Write the temperature in the same notebook or spreadsheet in which you are recording the weight.

, Once the puppy is warmed and active, it is time to feed it. Try to see if the mother dog will let the puppy latch onto her teat. Puppies need the first milk from their mom, as it has valuable immune factors in it (antibodies) that a pup needs to build his immune system.


You may need to give the weak puppy a little one on one time with his mom. Keep any other puppies in the same room as the mom but keep them away from her body while the weak puppy attempts to nurse.

, If the puppy is warm, yet weak and unable to nurse, it may have a low blood sugar. Place two or three small drops of corn syrup on its tongue to correct this problem. Specific signs of hypoglycemia in a newborn puppy are:Weakness and lethargy.
Tremors and twitches. (Normal newborn puppies will twitch, so combine this with other signs of hypoglycemia to differentiate between normal twitches and abnormal twitches.)
Convulsions.
Unresponsive or comatose.

, If the pup is warmed sufficiently and wants to suckle, you may need to feed it suitable milk formula if the mother won’t let it nurse or it is unable to latch on to a teat. Purchase puppy replacement formula from a veterinary office or a reputable pet store. It can be fed via nursing bottles or by using a syringe.


Mix the formula according to directions and make sure it is warm but not too hot, much like you’d prepare formula for a human baby.

, A weak new born puppy should be fed every three to four hours, including nights. Divide the total daily feeding (found on the formula container label) by the number of daily feedings.


For example, feeding every three hours will be eight feedings total, and feeding every four hours will be six feedings.
Make sure to feed fresh, warm formula each feeding.

, Newborn puppies need stimulation of the genital region in order to urinate and defecate appropriately. Usually the mom dog does this but you will need to do this for a neglected puppy.


Take a clean cotton ball and wet it with warm water. Gently rub it on the genital region of the puppy. The puppy will urinate and/or defecate as need be from this stimulation.
Wipe the genital area with a clean tissue to clean up any mess and dispose of the cotton ball and tissue in the garbage. Wash your hands well afterwards.

, If the puppy is not responding to your attempts to warm her or won’t eat, you need to take her to the veterinarian for treatment. Dehydration is dangerous and puppies can quickly die from it if they are unable to nurse and adequate amount.


Also see your veterinarian if your puppy has diarrhea, has fluid coming from the nose, or if you have any other concerns regarding her health. Timely treatment is very important in the newborn puppy. If you wait too long the puppy may die.

Do some research to find out what breed is best for you and your family.,
Consult with a veterinarian or dog trainer about breeds you are interested in.,
Consider the overall cost of adopting or buying a new pup, as well as the cost of caring for it over its lifetime.,
Buy or adopt a puppy that is appropriate for your current lifestyle and limitations.",How to Take Care of a Puppy1," Whether or not you can care properly for your dog depends largely on the specific needs of the dog breed you choose. There is a lot of variety between dog breeds. Ask yourself the following questions to help you narrow down to a specific dog breed:How much space will it need?
How much attention will it require?
Do I want a lap dog or an energetic dog?
Do I want my dog to fetch?
Is the breed good around children?
Will the breed be comfortable in my regional climate?
Will the breed get along with my other pets?
How dangerous is the breed??
How many years do dogs of a certain breed normally live?;
, This can be a great help in narrowing down your decision. Veterinarians interact and work with all kinds of breeds on a daily basis and can give you some helpful insight before making your decision.Dog trainers can help clarify the nature of certain breeds, looking beyond a breeds cute exterior to their needs and general characteristics.
Consider getting a mixed breed dog. Whether a mutt from the pound or Humane Society, or a specially bred mixed breed dog, such as a puggle, mixed breed dogs can have lower chances of having an inherited congenital disease and can be just as great of a companion as a purebred dog., It costs more to feed a larger pup, but other things like spaying and neutering, heart-worm and flea medications, grooming, and boarding fees also cost more the larger your puppy is.


You should also consider how much of the breed you want cost. Some specialized breeds can be extremely expensive.
Along with these, you will also need consider and budget for the cost of routine vaccinations, training classes for your puppy, annual vaccinations, dental care, and routine blood work throughout their life.
Other potential costs, that can come unexpectedly and should be planned for are injuries, illnesses, and emergencies.

, Once you have weighed your options, pick the dog breed that best suits how you currently live your life. You may have the intention exercising more or going hiking once you get a dog, but if you get a dog that needs a lot of activity and your lifestyle doesn't change, you could be setting yourself, and your puppy, up for failure.

, You'll need puppy shampoo, conditioner, a towel, and treats. Run warm water into the tub. Give her a treat when you put her in the tub so she enjoys bath time. Slowly and gently, massage shampoo into her fur. Rinse with warm water. Then, condition and rinse. Dry her off and offer a few more treats.


Brush the puppy daily and after baths to prevent mats and tangles. Wash your puppy once every week or two. Remain calm and speak softly while grooming your puppy. This will put her at ease.

, Take a pair of grooming scissors and trim the hair around your puppy's nails, eyes, and ears. Longer hair inside the ears can make Chorkies prone to ear infections, so keep the hair short.


Make sure that hair hasn't matted down around the puppy's toes. When this happens, hair can wrap around the nails and cause them to become ingrown.This can be very painful for the Chorkie.

, Start by establishing a routine. Take your puppy outside to the same general area every morning, around the same time. Once she's done her business, reward her with a small treat. This positive reinforcement will encourage her to go outside. On the other hand, never rub your your dog's face in an accident. She will not understand why you are doing this.Luckily, training in general is very successful with Chorkies. They are smart dogs eager to learn.

, Puppies should know the basics: sit, stay, and lie down.For example, teaching your dog to sit and stay by a door can be very simple. Tell your puppy to sit/stay by the door. When she does this, praise her. Open the door and let her outside. That is her reward. If she gets up as you open the door, close it and try again. Don't let her outside until she has followed the command.


Never punish a dog for refusing a command since dogs don't understand punishment. They will respond to positive reinforcement when they do a task correctly.

, Chorkies are energetic dogs, so go for long daily walks or to the dog park. A puppy who gets lots of exercise and play will be calmer, and more well behaved in general.Don't forget that play counts as exercise. Chorkies love toys and games of fetch.Be sure to use balls and toys designed for small breeds.


If you do take your dog to a dog park, make sure there is a special area for small breeds.

, Chorkies are very small breed dogs and need special attention while playing or exercising. Always keep your puppy properly leashed and collared at all times when on a walk.For example, they can sometimes be aggressive if approached by another dog or person. So, make sure to walk your puppy along a quiet route. If your puppy pulls on the leash during walks, use a walking harness.

, Give your Chorkie puppy the chance to meet lots of new people, not just people within the household. This will give her the experience of dealing with strangers and new places. Let your dog walk around and explore the new people and surroundings. If she is afraid, don't rush to pick her up or remove her. Let her adjust.Don't take your puppy out too much before she gets all her vaccinations, usually around 15 or 16 weeks old.

, To avoid bad behaviors associated with small dog syndrome, train your Chorkie. Regularly walk her on a leash, let her interact with other dogs, teach commands like ""sit"" or ""stay,"" and let her walk places; don't always carry her. This will teach her discipline and good behavior.Small dog syndrome is an attitude your Chorkie may develop. She may think and act like she's the boss: jumping up on people or nipping, growling, begging for food, etc., Your puppy will need several vaccines before she turns a year. Generally, puppies need to be vaccinated at 5 weeks, 6, weeks, 9 weeks, 12 weeks, and 15 weeks old. Your puppy should get core vaccines that include: distemper, canine adenovirus-2 (hepatitis and respiratory disease), canine parvovirus-2 and rabies. Talk with your veterinarian about giving your puppy non-core vaccines.


After your Chorkie has gotten all of her shots as a puppy, she'll need to see the veterinarian at least once a year.She may occasionally need to get booster shots.

, Puppies are likely to get worms several times while growing up. Ask your vet about preventative worming when your Chorkie is 2 to 3 weeks old. The veterinarian can give your puppy medication by mouth or give her a shot to kill any parasites. You'll need to follow up in a couple of weeks to get another dose of medication. This will kill any parasites that hatched.Recognize signs of worms in your puppy. If you notice your puppy has diarrhea or is vomiting, coughing, chewing or licking under her tail, is short of breath, or losing weight take a stool sample to the vet. Get your puppy treated for worms again.

, They're liable to have hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar. Know that Chorkies are susceptible to hypoglycemia. If so, you may notice decreased appetite, low energy, anxiety and restlessness, tremors, shivering, or confusion when doing normal things..If you notice your Chorkie puppy acting strangely, take her to the vet as quickly as possible.

, This happens when your dog's airway constricts or collapses. You may notice a dry honking cough, difficulty breathing, repeated (unsuccessful) attempts at vomiting, rapid breathing sounds, and loss of consciousness. If your Chorkie experiences any of these symptoms, take her to a vet immediately.


Tracheal collapse usually happens because of too much exercise, heat, or excitement. If your dog is overweight, she's also at risk for this problem.

, Chorkie dogs are prone to dislocated knee caps (patellar subluxation). This is caused by genetics or by injuries. You may notice your puppy continually limping in her hind leg, occasionally limping and lameness, or sudden lameness. Take your puppy to the vet, since only a vet can diagnose and treat this problem.


Normally, a dog will only feel pain when the kneecap slides out of place, but not after.

, There are several reasons for neutering your puppy. The main reason being to prevent your puppy from reproducing. There are pros and cons to this. For example, neutering prevents testicular cancer and prostrate problems in your dog. It may also reduce testosterone-related behavior problems. But, your dog may grow taller and gain more weight if neutered at an early age. Your puppy might also develop hip dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and begin inappropriate mounting.Talk over your options with your vet when making the decision to neuter or not.

, Millions of puppies are lost every year. Microchipping your puppy may make it easier to find her if she should get lost. Your vet will use a needle to insert a tiny chip behind her shoulder blades. It's rare, but microchipping can cause tumors near the site of the injection.


Understand that the microchip is useful only when someone scans your lost pet, such as at a shelter. You must also have current contact information submitted in order for your pet to be returned to you. If you move or change phone numbers, submit the new information."

Get yearly check-ups and blood screens.",How to Care for a Poodle," There are many kinds of wet and dry dog food on the market, with prices and flavors varying across a diverse spectrum. Don’t get overwhelmed by the variety, though. The most important thing about picking your poodle’s dog food is that it contain one or two whole proteins—for example, “chicken meal” or “lamb meal” and not “poultry meal” or “meat by-product”—at the top of the ingredient list. Avoid foods with a grain or other filler listed as the top ingredient.Many people choose to make their poodle’s food in order to control the recipe and make sure no extraneous chemicals or additives go into it. There are many recipes for homemade dog food, but all of them should have three, fundamental ingredients: meat, vegetables, and a filler carbohydrate such as rice.No matter what prepared or homemade food recipe you opt for, there are certain foods which you should avoid at all costs. For example, keep your poodle away from raw meat, dried fruit, fried foods, and allium vegetables, such as onions and garlic.;
, There are three sizes of poodles: standard, which weigh between 40 and 55 pounds, miniature, weighing between 12 and 15 pounds, and toy, weighing five to ten pounds. The size of your poodle determines how much food you should give it, so make sure to follow recommended guidelines in order to avoid weight-related problems in the future.You should consult your vet regarding your poodle's portions, as well as check the specific food labels on your dog food package. That being said, there are some rough guidelines you can use if such information is temporarily unavailable. Toy poodles should consume between ½ and ¾ cups of food per 24 hours, miniatures should have about a cup, and standards between 2 ¼ and 3 cups., Keeping your dog hydrated is essential to good health and nutrition: water lubricates and facilitates practically every function in your dog’s body, including joint cushioning, temperature maintenance, and digestion. If you use wet food, your dog can get quite a lot of its daily hydration requirements from its food, but you should still provide a large bowl of clean water at all times.You might want to consider purchasing a special pet fountain for your dog. Although many of these devices were created for cats who are attracted to running water, they perform multiple functions which are also beneficial to dogs, such as inhibiting bacteria growth and filtering out carbon., You’ve probably seen images of show poodles displaying what looks like a wacky, poofy grooming style.While you don’t need to mimic this look in your pet's style, you still need to follow a fairly strict grooming regimen in order to keep your poodle’s coat from matting. In addition to weekly brushing at home, you should get your poodle professionally groomed and trimmed every six to eight weeks.As a matter of fact, the poodle's trademark pompadours originated not as a decorative feature but out of necessity: having trained their poodles to retrieve ducks from the water, hunters needed a coat style that wouldn’t waterlog and bog them down, but would also keep their joints and cardiovascular system warm in the low temperatures., You should brush your poodle’s teeth daily with a vet-approved canine toothpaste and toothbrush. If you’ve adopted an adult poodle who hasn’t had prior daily dental care, get a professional cleaning done before beginning your daily regimen. This is especially important for toy and miniature poodles, as they tend to have more problems with receding gums.You can further support your poodle’s dental healthy by giving it rawhide bones and special dental treats to chew on. Just be sure to select a rawhide variety which contains no added flavor and is made in the U.S.A., Poodles don’t need as much exercise as some other energetic breeds, but you should still strive to walk them at least twice a day for no less than twenty minutes per walk.This is particularly important for standard poodles, as they are the largest sized poodle and the most active. Toy and miniature poodles require less physical activity, but you should still make sure they get enough exercise to maintain a healthy cardiovascular and digestive system.


A standard poodle can develop superior endurance and speed—some people have even trained for marathons with this boisterous breed!—but you should amp up activity gradually in order to avoid overheating.Backyards can be a great resource to let the poodle run around and play, but, since poodles are highly intelligent and crafty dogs, make sure the yard is well-equipped with tall, durable fences. Scan your fences carefully for any holes or weaknesses before letting your dog run around, and don’t let your dog be outside when you’re not home to supervise.

, Poodles were originally bred in Germany to be trackers and water retrievers, so they have innately excellent senses of smell and intelligence. Field events, hunting, tracking, and agility exercises are all excellent options which let the poodle use these natural skill sets and interests while keeping it mentally engaged and physically active.Tracking training involves getting the dog to follow a tracklayer’s scent over an extended distance, navigate obstacles in the terrain, and find and retrieve an object such as a glove or hat carrying the tracklayer’s scent. If you’re not familiar with the procedure, you can get help with this kind of training through local poodle organizations, obedience classes, or American Kennel Club chapters.

, Poodles are loving, giving dogs, but this also means they need tons of attention in return. They prefer to be with you at all times, so include your dog in anything you can. For example, take it with you to your kids’ baseball game, out on your morning jog, and to your friends’ barbecue.Since poodles don’t tolerate solitude very well, you should provide them with a distraction toy such as a Kong-type food delivery toy when you must leave them alone. Otherwise your poodle will act out and keep its mind occupied through other, often destructive behaviors, such as chewing on furniture or shoes.

, Most experts agree that the best way to train a dog is through positive reinforcement—that is, rewarding behaviors you want the dog to do instead of punishing negative ones. In this approach, you give treats and/or verbal praise when the dog does something good or follows your commands. Just make sure that you give the treat and praise within a few seconds of the correct behavior, as otherwise your dog won’t understand what they’re being rewarded for.Treats should be small, easily chewed, and healthy, so don’t use human foods which get the dog used to salty snacks and can encourage begging. Using individual kernels of your dog’s normal dry food can be a good option.

, You should make sure to get your poodle the rabies, distemper, parvovirus, and adenovirus vaccines at the very least.You can also get a flu shot and other preventative shots for your poodle, but these are not strictly essential according to veterinary guidelines.


For example, if you live in areas with high populations of rattlesnakes or ticks, you might want to consider getting special vaccinations against rattlesnake venom or lyme disease., There are some diseases and conditions such as Addison's and Cushings disease which affect poodles more than they do other breeds, so you should know what to look for and how to prevent developing problems.Symptoms like itchiness, dry skin, or abnormal bumps call for a visit to the vet, while more serious symptoms such as difficult urination, distended abdomen, discolored gums, or cloudy eyes warrant a more urgent trip to the emergency clinic.You should also watch out for symptoms of allergies. Poodles are not a breed particularly prone to food allergies, but keep an eye out for any symptoms such as itchy skin, excessive licking, or ear infections. If you notice any of these problems, visit your local veterinary office and see if they think food could be the cause of your dog’s allergy., In addition to staying current on your dog’s vaccines, you should take it to the vet every year for a standard check-up and blood tests. These tests will indicate any newly developing infections or diseases, and early detection of serious conditions like Addison’s will greatly improve your dog’s chances of recovery and life expectancy.Be proactive about your dog's health by asking your vet some questions whenever you see them. For example, ask if your poodle's weight is within prescribed guidelines, if you should see a specialist about any ongoing problems, or if your dog should get a professional dental cleaning.You also might want to consider purchasing health insurance for your poodle. While poodles are known as generally healthy dogs, veterinary costs can add up quickly if your poodle contracts a disease or has an accident. Ask your vet what they think about it and explore policy options online."

Discourage bad behavior as a puppy.",How to Train Havanese Dogs," Crate training your Havanese, whether he’s a puppy or an adult, will give him his own place of safety and comfort. It will also keep him safe from household hazards and make it easy to transport him when it’s time to go to the vet.For crate training to be effective, your Havanese will need a crate with enough space for him to move around comfortably, but not so much that he can create a bathroom area.


Ideal crate sizes for your Havanese are 24 inches by 18 inches (61 cm x 46 cm) and 24 inches by 24 inches (61 cm x 61 cm).;
, Your Havanese will enjoy his time in the crate when you make it comfortable and cozy for him. Place a soft blanket in the crate.You can also drape a blanket or towel on top of the crate to make it feel like a cozy den.Place some of his favorite toys in the crate, along with a spill-proof water bowl.To prevent your Havanese from feeling isolated, put the crate in an area with a lot of human activity, such as the kitchen or family room. Make sure the crate is away from drafts and direct sunlight., Your Havanese may hesitate to enter the crate the first time you show it to him. Entice him to enter the crate by placing bits of tasty treats near the crate, just inside the crate, and far back in the crate. Whether it takes him a few minutes or a few days to enter the crate, be patient with him. Do not force him into the crate.Give him lots of verbal praise when he enters the crate. You want him to make a positive association with being in the crate.
At this stage of crate training, leave the crate door open so he can enter and exit the crate freely.
Once he can enter the crate with treats, begin feeding him his meals in the crate., The first time you close the door, open it before he finishes eating. With each meal, leave the door closed for a few minutes longer until you can keep the door closed for 10 to 15 minutes after the meal. Open the door only if he is not whining.Whining may indicate that you were too quick with increasing the amount of time of having the door closed. Even still, if you open the door when he whines, he will learn that whining will get him out of the crate.If he whines, shorten the 'door close' time after the next meal and increase the time more slowly.

, When your Havanese can handle the door being closed after mealtime, practice closing the crate door and leaving the room. Outside of mealtime, give him a verbal command (‘crate time’) to enter the crate. Leave the room for 5 minutes, then come back. If he is comfortable with you being gone for 5 minutes, increase the time you leave the room by 5-minute intervals until you reach 30 minutes.You can also try returning to the crate at random time intervals.Your Havanese may need a few repetitions to learn the verbal command. When you say it, point your finger toward the crate and immediately give him a treat when he enters the crate.If your Havanese whines when you leave the room, do not open his crate door until he quiets down.

, When your Havanese can remain calm when you leave the room for 30 minutes, he will likely be ready to handle longer periods of time in his crate.Practice crating your Havanese when you leave home for a few hours, and overnight.


Havanese dogs can develop separation anxiety. When you crate him for extended periods of time, make sure he has plenty of toys (including food puzzle toys) to keep him busy.If you have a Havanese puppy, he won’t be able to hold his bladder for long stretches. To determine how many hours your puppy can hold his bladder, take his age in months and add 1.For example, a 3-month old puppy can hold his bladder for 4 hours.
When you let your Havanese out of the crate after a few hours, immediately take him outside to eliminate.
For overnight crating, you may need to take your Havanese out to eliminate during the night.If he needs to eliminate, you may hear him whining or pawing at the crate door.

, If your Havanese whines when he’s in his crate, it can be hard to ignore, especially if you’re not sure if he’s whining for attention or to eliminate. For young puppies, the whining is likely for eliminating; when you take him out, let him eliminate and bring him immediately back in without interacting with him. If he’s whining for attention, he’ll eventually quiet down after he realizes it won’t get your attention., Havanese dogs can be very difficult to house train. Litter box training is a good alternative to house training for little dogs. Doggie litter boxes are available at your local pet store. They have a flat square surface or pan with an artificial grass covering.When your Havanese urinates in the litter box, the urine would go through the artificial grass to the underlying surface or pan.You could also make your own litter box with a plastic dog pan. Line the dog pan with layers of pee pads.Place the litter box where your Havanese can easily access it and will have some privacy when using it.Place it away from his food and water bowls.

, Although you are training your Havanese to eliminate inside, he should still be on a schedule. Puppies need to eliminate frequently, so a bathroom schedule will be very important if you have a Havanese puppy. Your puppy should eliminate after eating, drinking, waking up from a nap, first thing in the morning, and before bedtime.If you have an adult Havanese, he should eliminate a few times day, preferably after meals and before bedtime.

, When it’s time for your Havanese to eliminate, walk him over to the litter box. When he eliminates, praise him and give him a treat.Over time, your Havanese will learn that the litter box is the correct place for him to eliminate.

, Litter box training your Havanese is certainly convenient if you live in an apartment or have a busy work schedule that keeps you away from home for long hours. Fortunately, your Havanese can still learn to potty outside.Proper crate training will help with house training, since your Havanese will have already learned where he should (and shouldn’t) eliminate.
If he has an accident in the house, clean up the mess with an enzymatic cleaner, which you can purchase at your local pet store. Do not punish him for the accident., Puppies and adults have different attention spans. If you have a Havanese puppy, his attention will last for only a few minutes; train him for 1 or 2 minutes, several times a day. If you have an adult Havanese, training sessions can last up to 20 minutes., Training your Havanese should be a positive experience for him. Positive reinforcement includes cheerful verbal praise (‘Good job!’ or ‘Good dog!’), tasty treats, and extra petting. Use positive reinforcement when he follows a command correctly or behaves properly (e.g., eliminating in the right place).The more positive the training experience, the more your Havanese will want to behave well.


Cut the treats into small bits that are about the size of your fingernail., Consistency is key when training a Havanese. For example, when giving a command, use the same wording in the same tone of voice, and the same hand signal (if necessary), each time. If you have other household members, make sure they follow the same training regimen as you.If you or other household members are not consistent with training, your Havanese will become confused about how to behave.

, Once your Havanese has mastered a command (sit, stay, heel), he should follow it the first time you say it from that point forward. If you say a command more than once, your Havanese will learn that he can ignore the command and do as he pleases., A Havanese puppy is irresistibly cute. This cuteness may tempt you to think your puppy’s bad behavior is cute, too. However, if you don’t want your puppy growing into an adult that jumps onto furniture (or people), chews on your shoes, or nips at you during playtime, discourage this behavior at the puppy stage. Allowing this behavior will teach your Havanese that he is in control.A firm ‘No!’ can be effective at stopping the bad behavior.
You can also ignore your Havanese while he is misbehaving. Once he realizes that the behavior gets no attention from you (positive or negative), he may stop."

Remove any small, sharp, hazardous items from places that the puppy can get to. Make sure that all electric cords, wires, batteries, etc. are put away and are not connected to the wall in places where the puppy can chew on them. There is a danger of electric shock if your puppy chews on connected wires.Keep in mind that as the pup grows it may be able to reach table tops as well.

, Dogs enjoy eating plants and grass very much, so if you are a plant-lover you may have to move, or re-home, a lot of your plants. The stems and leaves of some plants contain various substances that can be toxic to the pet who chews on them.


Some examples of these plants are dieffenbachia (or dumb cane), caladium, philodendron, and elephant's ear.
In addition to this, many yard plants such as shrubs, flowers, and trees are also dangerous to your puppies. Some examples include rhododendrons, chrysanthemum, and oleander.

, Some of the more common you need to look out for include household cleaners, insecticides, fertilizers, and mouse and rat poisons. The odor of these products may attract your puppies, so you need to put them where your puppy can not reach them.

, Some of the foods that we eat, including chocolate, onions, raisins and grapes, and even sugarless chewing gums, can be toxic to pups and should be kept well out of reach. You can find good information online about what your pup should avoid, in addition to discussing it with your veterinarian.


If your puppy does ingest a foreign object or toxic substance, contact your veterinarian immediately., When you bring your puppy home to a new and unfamiliar environment, it can take anywhere from 2 days to 2 weeks for them to get accustomed to their new surroundings. It is best to decide where they will be allowed to go before bringing them home. This will help to avoid confusion and establish their area from the beginning.


Use baby gates and shut doors to any rooms that will be off-limits to the puppy and be consistent with this off-limits training. Later you can gradually expand their area as they become more adjusted.

, The kitchen is a common area for food and water because it is easy to clean. Once you decide on a place, it is best to keep them there at all times. This will eliminate possible confusion and make it easier to maintain a routine.

, Buy a comfortable dog bed or learn how to make a dog bed for your pooch. By giving your puppy a comfortable place to sleep right when you bring it home, you can train it not to sleep with you in your bed. Be aware that once a pup is allowed to sleep in your bed, it can be difficult to teach them to sleep in their own.


Entice your puppy into its bed for the first time with a chew toy or a bone. To get it to want to sleep in the designated area will take continued and consistent training.
Establishing the area, your bed, a doggie bed, or a crate, ahead of time will help to make the adjustment easier.

, If you already have a fence, or are planning to have a fence installed, inspect the fence thoroughly for any space that may be small enough for your puppy to squeeze through. Patch any holes or spaces immediately to avoid any unexpected escapes from the yard.


Also, check your yard daily for objects that may have fallen or been thrown into their area. Remove anything potentially harmful before your puppy goes outside., If you plan on keeping your puppy in a doghouse, design the perfect doghouse with proper protection for all seasons. For instance, the doghouse should have a raised floor that provides extra insulation.


Furthermore, do not keep your puppy in doghouse for longer than eight or nine hours at a time. "

Consider adding more complex commands.",How to Train Puggles," New dog training methods recommend rewarding and encouraging your dog, instead of punishing it. Fortunately, your puggle will do almost anything for food rewards. You can use some of your puggle's daily kibble ration or other healthy treats as a reward. Consider keeping treats in your pocket so you can train your puggle at any point throughout the day.If your dog is eating healthy treats instead of its daily kibble ration, you may need to cut back on the amount of food it gets at meals. You don't want your puggle gaining weight because of training.;
, Never hit or yell at your puggle to punish it. Although your dog may respond to the harsh treatment, it is acting out of fear of punishment instead of learning what is and isn't appropriate behavior. Using harsh treatments will just teach your dog to fear you since it doesn't understand why you're punishing it.Physical punishment can make your puggle frustrated or anxious. This may cause pent up anger issues that make your dog aggressive.

, Your puggle will respond well to reward-based training. To do this, reward your dog when it follows a command. You can use food, verbal praise, or play time with toys as rewards. Just find out what your dog enjoys best and use that as a reward. If your puggle seems distracted, use simple rewards for simple commands. Save more exciting or tasty rewards for bigger commands. This way, you can reward your dog's good attention with really tasty rewards.Positive reinforcement will also make your puggle more loyal to you since it will be watching you for opportunities to earn treats.

, Purchase a clicker device and teach your dog to associate the clicking sound with a reward for obeying a command. You can do this by clicking the device and giving your puggle a food treat. When you're training your puggle, you should click the device and give it a treat whenever it obeys a command. Your puggle will learn to associate proper behavior with the clicker sound.For example, if you're teaching your puggle to come, begin clicking as soon as your dog turns in your direction. Continue to click until it comes to you and give a reward when it completes the command.

, Your puggle has a short attention span so you should do several 5 minute training sessions spaced throughout the day. This is better than one long training session. You can gradually increase the length of the training session as your puggle's concentration improves. Always end training while your puggle is happy and pleased (you'll notice its tail wagging). This way your puggle looks forward to the next training session.If your puggle gets distracted during training, give a simple command that you know it can do and end the session. This will end the session on a positive note.

, You may be frustrated with your puggle's tendency to suddenly go off and follow a scent. This is a well-known characteristic of the beagle breed and one of the reasons that training puggles is challenging. Remember that your puggle is an intelligent dog. Be prepared to put in lots of training hours and don't be discouraged.Don't expect results over night. Training will take consistent effort and practice.

, You should begin house training your puggle as soon as you bring it home. Take your puggle straight out to the spot where you want it to toilet. Pop your dog on the spot and reward it with verbal praise if it happens to toilet. Lots of verbal praise will encourage your dog to wait and toilet in the correct place.Make sure you set up a puppy room where your dog will sleep and eat. This way, your puggle won't roam around your house, which could make house training more difficult.

, If you have a young puggle (around 8 weeks old or less), take your puppy outside every 20 to 30 minutes. If you have an older puggle, take the dog to the toileting spot about 20 minutes after eating since most dogs tend to toilet after meals. If your dog is outside and showing signs of needing to eliminate, pick it up and put it on the toilet spot.Signs that your dog needs to toilet include sniffing with concentration or sneaking up to objects.

, Your puggle will probably have a few accidents before you completely house train it. React calmly and quickly clean up the accident. Be sure to thoroughly clean the mess so your dog won't return to the spot to toilet again. You'll need to use an enzymatic cleaning product designed to remove pet urine.Avoid punishing your dog since it won't associate the punishment with the action of toileting in the wrong place.

, You may need to safely crate your dog when you won't be home for a while. Purchase a crate that's large enough for a full-grown puggle to completely turn around in. Since adult puggles usually range from 15 to 30 pounds, you'll need a crate about 24"" by 24."" Fill it with a comfortable bed, a water bowl, and some toys. These things will make your puggle feel comfortable and secure.Staying in a crate teaches your dog some bladder control since your puggle is less likely to soil its crate or den.
Leave treats in the crate for your puggle to discover. Let it wander in and snack, but leave the door open.

, Let your puggle become familiar with the comfortable crate while keeping the door open. Once your dog has checked out the crate a few times, begin closing the door just for a few seconds. Praise your puggle if he remains calm. Gradually extend the amount of time you keep the door closed so that your puggle is just as happy with the door closed as with it open.Avoid letting your puggle out when it cries (as long as you're sure it doesn't need to toilet). Doing so conditions your dog to expect release whenever it cries. Instead, wait until your dog is quiet and then let it out so that good behavior is rewarded.

, Hold a small food treat between your finger and thumb so that the treat is just in front of your puggle's nose. Add the command ""sit"" as you show it the treat. When you have its attention, raise the treat in an arc going back over its head. As its nose follows the treat, the puggle's bottom naturally sinks to the ground. As soon its bottom contacts the floor, press the clicker and give the treat.Repeat the command until your puggle quickly obeys to just the verbal command.

, Once your puggle has learned the sit command, have it sit. Hold up your hand so that your palm faces your dog in a stop signal. Firmly say ""stay"" and take a small step back. Wait for a few seconds to make sure your puggle doesn't move, then pat your thighs and call the puppy's name. Say ""come"" using a playful bright voice.Remember to reward your puggle with treats or praise when it runs to you. If your dog is struggling to follow the command, make it sit and try again, holding the stay command for a shorter amount of time.

, Play with your puggle in a large fenced in area that's somewhat free of distractions. Take several steps away from your dog. Wave a treat in your hands and say ""come"" in an excited voice. Give it praise as soon as it begins running towards you and reward with the treat and a click.If your dog doesn't come to you, avoid punishing it. Jog backwards a little and clap your hands while calling its name. Your puggle may think you're playing a game and will want to run towards you.

, Once your puggle has mastered simple commands, you can train it to do more complicated commands or tricks. Just make sure not to overwhelm your puggle. When teaching a complex trick, break it down into individual components. This way, you can teach one element at a time before adding them together for the complete trick.


Remember, your puggle will be easily distracted. Teach commands in different environments so it learns to obey you no matter where you are, rather than only when you are at home.

Get a veterinary diagnosis.,
Use medication to control the condition.,
Consider the option of open-heart surgery.,
Discuss the option of a balloon valvuloplasty with the veterinarian.",How to Treat Aortic Stenosis in German Shorthaired Pointers1," Take your German shorthaired pointer to a veterinarian if you are worried about its health. The veterinarian will carefully listen to the heart with a stethoscope and may perform other tests, such as an ultrasound, EKG (electrical) measurements, or radiographs to assess the heart and its electrical activity. Typical signs and symptoms of aortic stenosis can include:Heart murmur
Cardiac arrhythmia
Enlarged heart and aorta
Congestive heart failure;
, There are three options for treatment for dogs with aortic stenosis. These include the use of medication to control symptoms, balloon valvuloplasty, and open heart surgery to correct the condition. Medications, such as beta-blockers, are used to help the heart muscle relax enough to allow the heart chambers to fill with blood.Atenolol is a commonly used beta blocker used for this condition.
In a few cases medications are used to prevent the heart muscle from over building.

, Open-heart surgery may be an option if you live in an area that has a specialized animal hospital that does the procedure.This is done to improve cardiac output function and to control arrhythmias. Open heart surgery is a risky procedure requiring specialized equipment (heart-lung bypass machines) and is a very complex, risky and costly operation.


Because of the complexity and risk of this procedure, management with medication is the treatment of choice.

, Balloon valvuloplasty is a less invasive surgical procedure than open heart surgery. However, in dogs it has been found to only have a short-term effect, so therefore it is not routinely recommended.Balloon valvuloplasty and open heart surgery are procedures reserved for cardiac specialists in large teaching or specialty hospitals.

Start crate training early.,
Select a crate.,
Encourage your Shihpoo to enter the crate.,
Teach your Shihpoo to stay in the crate.,
Start socializing your Shihpoo early.,
Introduce your Shihpoo to new experiences.,
Enroll your Shihpoo puppy in puppy kindergarten.,
Keep training sessions short and upbeat.,
Teach your Shihpoo basic commands.,
Use only positive reinforcement during training.",How to Train Shihpoos," Since Shihpoos can be stubborn, you should start training your Shihpoo as soon as you bring him home. If you wait too long, his stubbornness could add a frustrating challenge to your training.Crate training will help keep your Shihpoo out of trouble when you are not home. It will also increase the likelihood of him going to the bathroom outside, rather than in his crate or elsewhere in your home.Crate training should be a positive experience for your Shihpoo. At the end of training, he should see the crate as a place of comfort and safety, not punishment.;
, The typical Shihpoo weighs between 8 and 18 pounds (3.6 to 8.2 kg), so you will not need a large crate.Pick a crate size suitable for a Shih Tzu or Toy Poodle. It should be large enough for him to move around and be comfortable in, but not so large that he could create a bathroom area.


The ideal crate size for a Shihpoo is 24 x 18 inches (61 x 46 cm) or 24 x 24 inches (61 x 61 cm).Place the crate in an area of your home where there is a lot of human activity, such as the family room.You don’t want your Shihpoo feeling isolated when he is in the crate.

, Your Shihpoo may not want to explore the crate right away. To make it look more inviting, place some of his favorite toys inside. You could also place a comfortable blanket in the crate.If your Shihpoo is still reluctant to go in the crate, place some food near the crate. Then, work up to placing some tidbits of food inside the crate, and eventually feeding him his meals in the crate.Talk to your Shihpoo in a bright and encouraging voice as he explores his crate. You want his exploration to be a positive experience.Leave the crate door open so your Shihpoo can explore at his leisure without fear of you closing the door behind him.
It may take your Shihpoo a while to feel comfortable with the crate. Be patient with him and don’t force him inside of it.

, When your Shihpoo feels comfortable entering the crate on his own, begin leaving him in the crate with the door closed. He may not like this part, so start with closing the door for only about 1 minute. Close the door slowly so you don’t startle him.If he starts to whine, wait until he calms down before opening the door.


Try closing the crate door, leaving the room, then returning to the crate at random time intervals.Over several weeks to months, gradually work up to leaving your Shihpoo in the crate while you are away from home, and even overnight.Until they are 12 months old, puppies can typically hold their bladders for about 1 hour per month of age.If you have a Shihpoo puppy, don't leave him in the crate beyond the length of time he can hold his bladder.
When you let your Shihpoo out of the crate, always give him lots of praise and take him outside to eliminate.

, Socialization is a very important aspect of your Shihpoo’s training. It involves exposing him to new sights, sounds, and experiences so he can grow into a confident and well-rounded adult dog. If you have a Shihpoo puppy, begin socializing him when he is between 8 and 16 weeks old. After 16 weeks of age, a puppy who is not well socialized may be fearful of nearly everything in his environment., To socialize your Shihpoo, expose him to as many new experiences as possible when he is a puppy. Make sure these experiences are positive so he does not become fearful as he grows older. For example, when you introduce him to someone new, give this person a dog treat that they can give to your Shihpoo. If you introduce him to children, make sure they are well behaved and not rough with him.You can also have your Shihpoo walk on different surfaces (e.g., wet grass, metal manhole covers) so he becomes comfortable with different sensations on his paws.Take your Shihpoo with you to run errands. Also, let him hear typical indoor noises (e.g., vacuum cleaner, blender).If you have adopted an adult Shihpoo that is not well socialized, try to identify his weak socialization area, such as other pets or men with hats.Ask the animal shelter (or previous owner) about what areas of socialization he will need.

, Puppy kindergarten is a great way to socialize your Shihpoo puppy with other dogs and allow him to start learning basic obedience concepts, all while having fun. Consider observing a class or two before enrolling him, just so you can see how the trainer manages the dogs in the class.Some puppy kindergartens may require a puppy to be fully vaccinated before enrollment. If your puppy is not fully vaccinated, continue socializing at home and enroll him after he is fully vaccinated. Ask your veterinarian about your puppy’s vaccination status., Shihpoos have short attention spans, so long training sessions will not be effective for your Shihpoo.Short training sessions throughout the day that are frequent and repetitive are ideal.There is no set length of time for a training session. Young puppies (a few months old) may be able to pay attention for only a few minutes; older puppies (approaching 1 year old) and adults might be able to stay attentive for up to 20 minutes.Use toys and treats to keep the training sessions upbeat and exciting., Train your Shihpoo to sit, stay, heel, and come. If you are having trouble teaching your Shihpoo these commands on your own, consider enrolling him in an obedience class. Be mindful that it may be his stubbornness or short attention span, rather than a lack of understanding, that is making his training a challenge.


Do not repeat a command. This would teach your Shihpoo that he does not have to listen to you the first time you give a command.Teach only command at a time.Once your Shihpoo has mastered the basic commands, try teaching him more advanced commands and tricks, like rolling over or playing dead.

, Shihpoos do not respond well to yelling or harsh punishment. Positive reinforcement, including treats and verbal praise, works much better than harshness when training a Shihpoo.Since Shihpoos are so eager to please, the more positive reinforcement you give your Shihpoo, the more he will want to please you and do the right thing.

Find out what dog food your puppy was started on before you got it.,
Purchase good quality puppy food.,
Start off with a dry dog food specially formulated for puppies.,
Avoid feeding your puppy potentially harmful human food scraps.,
Put your puppy on a feeding schedule based on their age.,
Feed your puppy at the same time everyday and keep the type of food consistent.,
Use the guidelines on the food bag to determine the appropriate amount of food and measure it out at each feeding.,
Feed a specific breed puppy food if you have a large breed puppy, such as a Great Dane or Mastiff.,
Keep fresh water out for your puppy at all times.",How to Take Care of a Puppy3," Purchase that food if possible. Sudden changes in diet can easily upset a puppy's stomach. You can always do a gradual change later if needed.

, It is extremely important to make sure your puppy is eating a high quality food to ensure that they are receiving the best nutrition. This doesn't mean you have to run out and purchase the most expensive bag of food, it just means you should be aware of what type of ingredients you are feeding your puppy.


Ask your veterinarian to recommend the best food for your budget.

, For very young and newly weaned pups, you can also add a small amount of water to their dry food to make it easy for them to chew and gradually eliminate it over a week or two.


Always choose a dog food that is primarily made of meat, not corn. Dogs were not meant to eat corn and it can upset their digestive system, especially in puppies. Choose to feed your puppy a grain-free diet if possible.

, Grapes, raisins, tea, alcohol, garlic, onions, avocados, salt, and chocolate are toxic to dogs. If your dog has ingested one of these things, call an Animal Poison Control Center.

, Puppies should not be removed from their mothers before they are eight weeks old. After they are eight weeks old, you can begin a feeding regimen based on the age of the puppy. The serving size will depend on the breed and the size of the puppy. Be sure to look up the specific feeding instructions for your breed of puppy.


Three to four weeks old: Begin to mix some solid food into the puppy's diet along with their mother's milk. To make it easier for the puppy to digest, mix the food in some of its mother's milk or a puppy replacement milk. Feed your puppy whenever it cries because it is hungry. Usually this will be about four times per day.
Six to eight weeks old: Feed your puppy a puppy formula dry food that is rich in protein and calcium. Again, make sure that real meat is the first ingredient on the ingredients label.
Generally, puppies less than 6 months old will need to be fed three to four times a day depending on their breed and size. You can reduce this to twice a day for most pups when they are around six months old.

, Puppies cannot handle abrupt changes in their diet and will be house trained more easily if they eat at consistent times every day. This helps them to know when mealtime is, helps them go to the bathroom at consistent times, and helps you to know how much your dog is eating.

, Measuring out food helps to prevent overeating and let's you keep track of your pup's appetite and eating habits. Allow it to eat for about 10-15 minutes and then the bowl should be picked up until the next feeding time.


Monitoring your pups weight and appearance can help to make sure you are feeding the appropriate amount. If you can see their ribs it may be underweight and if you can’t feel its ribs it is possibly overweight.
Be sure to discuss proper feeding amounts and your pups weight with your veterinarian at your puppy regular visits.

, Make sure you are feeding a puppy food specifically labeled for large breed puppies that food is designed to provide the proper nutrition to keep its bones growing healthy and strong and to help prevent some common diseases that can occur in these pups.


Again, your veterinarian is a great source of information about proper puppy nutrition., Change your puppy's water at least twice per day to ensure that your puppy is drinking clean water. Also remember to wash the bowl itself regularly.

Buy puppy toys, a collar, and a leash before bringing your new puppy home.,
Decide if you want to crate train your new pup.,
Allow your puppy to explore its new home.,
Socialize your puppy.,
Walk your puppy every day.,
Allow your puppy to play with other dogs for exercise.,
Take your puppy to the dog park once they are fully vaccinated.,
Play with your puppy!,
Show your puppy affection.",How to Take Care of a Puppy4," Have them waiting for it when you bring it home so that your puppy can immediately start playing with your family and going for walks. This will help the puppy to become comfortable in your home and immediately jumpstarts the puppy socialization process.


Be sure that the collar is the right size for your pup, not so tight that it restricts the puppy's breathing and not so loose that the puppy can wiggle out of it.

, If you do, you will need to purchase a crate and a pad to go inside it. Crate training can have huge benefits for your dog, as dogs have a natural instinct to find a safe space to call their own. While it may take some time for your puppy to adjust to sleeping in a crate, eventually most dogs find it a comforting and enjoyable space.


Your new puppy should be trained to sleep in its crate but it will need to be taken out during the night to go to the bathroom and it should not be stuck in a crate all day. Other than at night, your dog should not be left in their crate for more than 4 hours.
Crate training can also be helpful for housebreaking your puppy. Dogs naturally do not like to go to the bathroom where they sleep, so taking your dog out of the crate and outside to go to the bathroom can help teach them when and where to go.

, When you bring a puppy to an unfamiliar place for the first time, it will need to get accustomed to its surroundings. Make sure that all doors to the outside are closed but then allow it to roam about the house to sniff and explore its new environment.


Close any rooms that you want to designate as ""off-limits"" to your puppy. This way it won't become attached to any off limit spaces and you can avoid having to train the puppy not to go there later.

, Socialization is important for your puppy's development. It allows your pup to learn normal dog behaviors through exposure to other dogs and humans. It is best to begin socializing your puppy when it is a few weeks old. During that time, puppies are most accepting of new experiences and new people or dogs., Try to make sure that your puppy gets about an hour of exercise and/or play time per day. Don't over-exert your puppy by taking it on long runs, but do allow your puppy to run around the yard and go on walk at least once per day.


Different breeds need different amounts of exercise per day. Make sure to do your homework to find out how much exercise your particular puppy needs.
To avoid injury or damage to developing bones and joints, avoid prolonged forced exercise, such as long runs, until your puppy is closer to adult age. This varies between 1 and 2 years old depending on their overall size.

, Make sure that you have vaccinated your puppy and that the other dogs are friendly before allowing it to do so.


Once your pup has received at least its third set of vaccinations from your veterinarian, you can safely begin taking it to areas where other puppies and dogs go. Before its reached this stage, letting it spend time indoors with as many different people and other healthy dogs as possible will help in its socialization.
After its third set of vaccinations, try to start out with short walks around the neighborhood or playing short games in your backyard to gauge how quickly your puppy tires out or if it requires more exercise.

, Taking your puppy to a local dog park not only allows them to exercise and burn off some of that puppy energy, but it also is a really great way to socialize your puppy so they are familiar with other types of dogs whether they be large or small. Dog parks are also a great socialization tool for introducing your puppy to all kinds of people as well.

, This can be the best part of having a puppy and is key to keeping it healthy and preventing boredom, which can lead to unwanted behaviors, such as excessive barking and chewing. A stimulated puppy makes for a smart, happy, and healthy puppy who will tend to be more obedient than other puppies. Playing with your puppy is a great way to incorporate exercise each day and also build up the relationship and bond you have with your puppy.


Puppies love attention and affection, so during playtime, use a lot of positive reinforcement to let your puppy know that it is playing appropriately and that you love them.
A nice rub behind the ears or pat on the head goes a long way when telling your puppy that they are being good and that you care about them.You can help your puppy adjust to its new environment by spending as much time as possible interacting with it, but also be sure to give it time to be quiet and rest as needed. By playing, loving, and just interacting with your dog, it will soon begin to feel more comfortable in its new home.

, Cuddle and pet it every day. After all, puppies are babies that need to be nurtured and loved. Make sure to give your puppy positive signals and pet it frequently.

Look for signs of fatigue.,
Be concerned about this condition if your dog faints.,
Pay attention to difficulty breathing.,
Look for signs early in life.,
Understand that this condition can simply cause sudden death.",How to Treat Aortic Stenosis in German Shorthaired Pointers2," The symptoms that owners typically report in German shorthaired pointers with aortic stenosis include a variety of signs of fatigue. This is because the heart cannot pump blood well enough to supply the oxygen needed for normal or excessive exertion.Your dog may have a new intolerance for exercise. It may refuse to do activities that it once enjoyed.
Your dog may appear to be weak and lethargic. It may have trouble getting up and down or climbing inclines.

, Your dog may faint because of a serious case of aortic stenosis. This is more likely to happen when your dog is doing some sort of exercise that requires a lot of oxygen in its system. The fainting is due to a lack of oxygen circulating in its body.


If your dog faints you should have it seen by a veterinarian. Call your vet's office, explain the situation, and follow their advice of whether or not to bring the dog in immediately or not.

, It's important to pay attention to your dog's breathing, especially while it is exercising. Signs your dog is having difficulty breathing can include coughing, difficulty catching its breath, or heavy panting.If your German shorthaired pointer is having a hard time breathing from a very light amount of exercise, it could be caused by aortic stenosis.

, This is not a disease that only affects old dogs. Aortic stenosis can be found early in the life of a German shorthaired pointer, or it may develop around 1-2 years of life.One sign of this disease in puppies is that they have a failure to grow as rapidly as a puppy should.
However, the younger the dog is when the signs first appear, the more likely the condition is to be serious.

, In some cases, there are not warning signs that can be observed by a dog's owner. It will just suddenly die due to the aortic stenosis.If this happens to your dog, it is not due to you missing some warning signs you should have seen. It is just, unfortunately, how this disease functions in some cases.

Begin house training your puppy immediately.,
Pick a spot outside that is easy to get to, easy to clean, and that other dogs don't have access to.,
Look for early signs that you puppy needs to go.,
Stick to a feeding routine.,
Hook your puppy to its leash and try walking around in the chosen area.,
Use the word ""go"" to help to teach your puppy to go in their potty area.,
Distract, don't punish, a puppy that goes to the bathroom inside.",How to Take Care of a Puppy5," This is one of the first things to teach your new puppy. Until it is potty trained it is ideal to keep it where it can be watched at all times. You can use baby gates, keep it attached to a leash and with you, and you can also use a crate that is just large enough for it to stand up, lie down, and turn around in, when it can't be watched.

, Always using this area will help them learn where they should go and make the process much easier. It is important to always be consistent. Making trips outside as often as every 20 minutes can also help teach it where they should go.

, These include whining, circling, sniffing, barking, or any sudden behavior change. When you see these signs immediately take the puppy to their area.

, This will help your pup learn as fast as possible. A regular feeding schedule will help with a regular potty schedule. Take your pup out after every meal. Normally a puppy will need to go to the bathroom as soon as it wakes up in the morning and after any naps, after meals and drinking water, and on average about once every hour.

, This will help the designated area to smell familiar to the puppy and it will help show the puppy that this is an appropriate place to relieve itself.

, It is best to stay outside with your puppy until it goes potty so that it understands that this is what you want when you are both outside and so you will know it has gone. Always praise your puppy for going potty outside, you can tell it ""good dog"", and you can also give it a small treat to let it know it did a good job.

, If your puppy uses the restroom inside the house and you are there when it is happening, clap your hands and say the word ""no"" to distract the puppy from the action. Immediately pick it up and take it outside to finish its business.


Be sure to praise the puppy after it goes outside.
If the puppy has pooped in the house, pick up the poop and take it to the designated area outside to show the puppy that this is where it should go. The smell distinguishes the area to the puppy as well. If you are not present when the accident happens indoors, just clean up the mess and watch the puppy more closely to avoid this mistake again. It does no good to discipline your puppy after the fact because the puppy will not understand why you are upset."
"
Begin teaching basic commands as early as possible.,
Use a reward method to train your puppy.,
Use a delicate touch when using a disciplining method of training.",How to Take Care of a Puppy6," It is never too early to start practicing them. By establishing the basic commands, your puppy can build a foundation for learning to play games and get along with other people and dogs. Actions such as sit, down, stay, & come can be extremely useful when you need to get your puppy's attention. Teaching them these things also helps to establish roles in the relationship.



Teach your dog to come.

Teach your dog to sit.

Teach your dog to lie down.
After mastering basic commands, such as these, you can start practicing other tricks such as shake, rollover, and speak.

, When trying to let your puppy know that it is behaving appropriately or responding to a given command well, try using a reward method to get your message across to it. Reward your puppy with small treats that are given to them immediately following a good behavior or response to a command. Another form of reward is a gentle pat on the head or rub behind the ear while you say ""Good boy"" or ""Good girl"".


This attention and positive reinforcement lets your puppy know that when it behaves this way or responds to a command in this way, it will receive a reward.
Be firm in your commands and strict with your treat disbursement. Don't just give the puppy treats at random times of the day or it won't learn that it has to work for its treats.
Choose healthy treats that are specially formulated for puppies. Don't give it leftover dinner scraps that it may not be able to digest easily.

, Disciplining your puppy can be a tricky way of letting them know good from bad behavior. When using a discipline method to train your puppy, you need to discipline it each time it behaves badly, which can be hard to follow through with if you are not watching your puppy all of the time.


Although it may not be the best way to train and teach your puppy good behavior, some discipline methods include a light mist from a spray bottle, a quick and sudden noise like a hand clap, or a firm ""No"". Each of these methods should get the attention of your puppy and distract them from the bad or unwanted behavior they were displaying."

Follow your veterinarian's set schedule for puppy vaccinations.,
Follow your veterinarian’s recommendations when deworming, but a general rule is to deworm monthly.,
Spay or neuter your puppy.,
Bathe your puppy regularly.,
Practice good puppy hygiene.",How to Take Care of a Puppy7," This will help to ensure your family's and your pup's health and happiness. Puppies should receive a set of four injections every three weeks starting ideally at six weeks of age. It is recommended to wait until after the third set of vaccines before allowing your pup to visit areas where other dogs have been or allowing them to interact with other dogs.


Standard puppy vaccines include Distemper, Parvo, and Hepatitis. Your veterinarian may also recommend others depending on a number of factors.
A Rabies vaccination should be given once they are 12 weeks or older.
Talk to your vet to find out which additional vaccines may be necessary for your puppy.
Be sure to take your puppy to the vet at least every six months for check-ups until it is a fully grown dog., Regular dewormings are important for you and your pup. Some intestinal parasites can be passed to humans, both adults and children, and routine dewormings can help to eliminate this possibility.


Also making sure to practice good hygiene yourself by washing your hands after handling your pup can decrease the chances of transmission.
Many heartworm preventatives, which are given monthly, are also an effective way to regularly deworm pups.
You may also need flea and/or tick preventative depending on the season and where you live.Observe your pups stool regularly, some parasites can be seen there. However, regular fecal checks, done at your regular vet visits, are the only way to detect many parasites.

, It is important to spay or neuter your puppy, ideally at around six months of age . Delaying the spay or neuter procedure only increases the risk that your puppy may develop unwanted habits, such as marking territory, escaping from your yard or fence in order to search for potential mates, aggression, and others.


It's generally a good idea to fix your puppy unless you are sure that you want to breed it at some point.
Delay can also lead to increased risk of uterine infections and the development of mammary, testicular, or prostate cancers later on in their life.
If you have questions about these procedures or need more information on anything related to your pup, discuss it with your veterinarian during your regular puppy visits., Puppies can get messy and dirty fairly quickly. In general, it's best to bathe them every two weeks or so, as needed. When bathing your puppy, it is beneficial to use a gentle conditioning or moisturizing shampoo specifically designed for puppies. Using a shampoo like this allows you to bathe it as often as needed without worrying about drying out your puppy's skin and hair coat.


Bathing your puppy not only prevents it from developing fleas and skin rashes, it also keeps your puppy from smelling badly.
If your puppy tends to stay clean the majority of the time, you can bathe them every two weeks or less. The frequency of bathing depends on your preference and your puppy's cleanliness.
Remember to go slow when first bathing your pup. This is a new experience for your puppy and you don't want to scare it by dumping water directly on its face or going too fast and causing it to slip in the tub. Sometimes something as simple as a quick foot bath is a nice way to get it used to this process and then gradually bathe more of your puppy each time it is exposed to this situation.
For long hair breeds such as a Shih Tzu, Poodle, Maltese, Papillon, and breeds similar to these, try to incorporate a brushing after baths to allow them to become familiar with a tool that will be used on them quite frequently when being groomed either at home or by a professional groomer., Clip your puppy's nails every few weeks to avoid dirt build-up and prevent your puppy from scratching people and things. Take good care of your puppy's teeth by brushing them with a special toothbrush and toothpaste made for dogs. Chew toys formulated with plague-fighting properties can also keep your puppy's teeth and gums healthy.

Use rewards-based training.,

Teach your dog to sit.,
Teach ""Stay"" once he has mastered ""Sit"".,
Teach the dog to ""come."",
Use repetition and don't get discouraged.",How to Train Goldendoodles," Modern dog training methods are based on rewards and encouragement, rather than punishment. This teaches the dog that when they perform a desired action, such as ""Sit"" or ""Stay"", they get a reward. Rewards make your dog keen to do as you ask, so training is centered on communicating to your dog that if they do a certain action, they will get a treat.;
, Harsh methods that involve dominating the dog are out-dated. While these methods might appear to work, the dog is behaving out of fear of punishment from the owner, rather than thinking for itself and making decisions about what it appropriate behavior and what is not. In addition, physical punishment can lead the dog to become frustrated or anxious. This can then lead to pent up anger, which can then spill over as aggression.

, The goldendoodle is a food-motivated dog, which makes giving small food rewards an ideal way of motivating your dog and rewarding those behaviors you wish to teach. However, rewards come in all shapes and sizes, and range from food tidbits to praise or play with a toy. Key to successful training is to work out what your dog will work for. If it likes playing with a tug toy, then a brief game of tug could be your way of motivating him. , Many people who choose to reward their dog with small treats can pair this with clicker training. Clicker training is a neat way of marking a desired behavior, to let the dog know what they are being rewarded for. The principal behind clicker training is to first teach the dog to link the click-clack of the clicker to getting a reward. Then you make the desired action with the click-clack.For example, when teaching ""Sit,"" you lure the dog into a sitting position and press the clicker as soon as the dog's bottom hits the ground.

, Remember your puppy has a short attention span, so several 5 minute sessions spaced over the day are better for an 8 - 10 week old puppy than one long session. Gradually increase the length of the training session as its concentration and stamina improves.

, If the dog or puppy is getting distracted, bring the training session to a close with a simple command you know it can do. This will allow you to praise it and leave it feeling happy with itself., Set up a puppy room in which the dog will sleep and eat, rather than letting it roam all over the house. Letting it roam your whole home will make potty training more difficult, as you will have a harder time keeping track of what it is doing. Take the puppy straight out to the spot that you intend it to use as a toilet. Pop it down on the spot and if the dog happens to 'go,' give it heaps of praise.The idea is for the dog to associate going to the bathroom in that spot with getting heaps of praise. This makes it worthwhile for the dog to save up its bodily functions in return for adoration.

, Of course potty training doesn't happen instantaneously and you need to stick at it. Training requires the puppy to learn where it is meant to go, and where it shouldn't go. To teach the later means constant vigilance. Watch it indoors like a hawk and when the dog shows the earliest signs of wanting to toilet, such as sniffing with great concentration or sidling up to objects, then pick it up and take it outside to the toilet spot. Then when the dog goes in the right place, lavish it with praise.

, An adult dog that has never been potty trained should be able to hold it for several hours once trained. However, to increase your success rate, take an 8 week old puppy outside every 20-30 minutes. If you can't be with the puppy in between toilet stops, then pop it in its crate rather than letting it go to the bathroom in the house. Also, puppies tend to toilet about 20 minutes after eating, so put him outside after each meal, and likewise immediately after eating., If the dog or puppy does have an accident indoors, be sure to thoroughly clean it up. There should be no lingering odor left behind once you have cleaned it.


A lingering odor could draw it back to use the same spot once again.

, The idea behind crate training is to create a space that belongs to the puppy which is there den. Choose a crate that is big enough for the puppy to stand up in without banging its head, and can lie down with its legs stretched out. An average male Goldendoodle can stand 2 feet (0.61 m) tall to the shoulder, so take this into account when choosing a crate.Pop a comfortable bed in the crate, a water bowl in one corner and some toys. At times when you can't be there to supervise the puppy, this is a safe place to confine it so that it can't chew household items. Putting a dog in a crate can also aid in house training. Natural instinct dictates that a puppy is less likely to soil its den, so staying in a crate teaches it some bladder control. However, you should never leave a dog in a crate for too long.

, Puppies readily learn to like the crate if you help them to discover that it is a place where good things happen. Seed it with treats for the puppy to pop in and discover. Feed the dog in the crate so that it associates the crate with meal times. Give it a chew toy while it is in the bed, but leave the door open. Early crate training is all about the dog getting comfortable and happy in the crate.

, Once the dog is popping in regularly to investigate if any treats have appeared, you can start to shut the door. At first this is just for a few seconds, perhaps while the dog is eating. When it is calm and quiet with the door closed, give it lots of praise.Gradually extend the amount of time the door is closed, until it is equally happy with the door open or closed.

, If the puppy cries while in the crate, don't release him while it is crying. If you respond to its cries then it will have trained you to let it out, and it may become ever more vocal if you don't do so. Instead, wait until the dog is quiet and then set it free, so that the good behavior is rewarded.

, It is essential for your goldendoodle to obey basic commands, such as ""sit"", ""stay"", and ""come."" If your dog obeys these instantaneously, you can control it in pretty much any situation.Begin this training with the ""sit"" command, and then follow with other commands once your dog has mastered ""sit.""To teach ""sit"", use a food lure. Hold a small treat between your finger and thumb. Hold it just in front of the dog's nose, and when you have its attention, raise the treat in an arc going back over its head.
As its nose follows the treat, its bottom naturally sinks to the ground. As soon as its butt contacts the floor, press the clicker. Then reward the dog with a treat.
Start adding in the vocal command ""sit"" as you show the dog the treat. This tells it what action it is you require.
If using a clicker, as it sits, then click.

, Put the puppy into a sit and then hold your hand up, palm towards the puppy in a ""Stop"" signal. Say ""Stay"" and take a small step back. Wait for a few seconds to ensure the pup doesn't move, then pat your thighs and call the puppy's name and say ""Come"" a bright voice. Reward him when he runs to you.

, To teach come, play with the puppy and take a couple of steps away from it. A puppy's natural instinct is to stay close to their mother, or minder, and so it will run to rejoin you. As soon as it moves toward you click your clicker or say ""come,"" and then give it a treat when it arrives.This is a very important skill for your dog to have, for both good interaction and for its safety.

, Keep repeating this desired action until the dog gets the hang of things, which may take quite awhile. Using these basic principles, you can train a dog to do more complex commands or tricks.


However, don't overwhelm your goldendoodle. Break complex tricks down into their individual components and teach one element at a time, then add them together for a more complex trick.
You can make training into a fun game with your dog. For example, throw a toy in the yard for your dog and train the dog it to bring it to you when you say a specific command, make it wait when you say ""stay,"" and come back to your without it if you say ""come."" A goldendoodle, with its great intelligence should be up to this task with enough training.

Recognize an unhappy dog.",How to Choose a High Energy Dog Breed," If you want a dog to go jogging or hiking with, you may want a dog that's bred to run. These dogs should have strong legs and a high stamina, as well as a respiratory system that can accommodate a high-intensity workout.


Choose dogs with lean, long bodies.
Avoid short-nosed breeds like pugs and bullmastiffs. These dogs are called brachycephalic  and they tend to have breathing problems that can make running dangerous.
Border collies, Weimaraners, large poodles (including standard poodles and Goldendoodles), dalmatians, and Australian cattle dogs are all excellent breeds that can run medium to long distances.;
, If you're looking for a dog that you can take hunting with you, you're in luck. There are many breeds that have been selected over many generations to produce a high-quality hunting dog equipped for any terrain.Physical attributes of a given breed are often just as important as that breed's energy level. Consider what type of hunting you'll be primarily engaging in and what type of environment that will entail.Waterfowl dogs should have a thick double coat and webbed feet to improve their ability to travel through water.
If you're seeking a dog that can run long distances in a hot climate, opt for a breed with a thinner coat to help it stay cool in the field.
For deer hunting dogs, choose a breed with a lot of energy and stamina, a strong sense of smell, and good vocal abilities.
Setters, pointers, beagles, hounds, and retrievers are all excellent hunting dog breeds. Talk to a breeder to find out which breeds would best match your hunting needs.

, Herding dogs, like hunting breeds, have been carefully bred over many generations. Specific attributes that make a given dog a good hunter have been selected for, yielding a tireless dog that can assert its authority over other animals.Choose a breed that makes consistent eye contact with herd animals, barks aggressively, and has a lot of energy and stamina.
Australian cattle dogs, shepherds, collies, and sheepdogs all make excellent herding dogs.

, Your energy level should be compatible with the energy level of your dog's breed. High-energy dogs need a lot of physical activity, and that extends beyond just having access to a yard. You'll need to give your dog long walks, and some breeds may need an owner who can take them jogging as well.Be honest with yourself as you assess your energy level.
If you can't provide a high-energy breed with a high-energy lifestyle, consider choosing a breed with lower energy levels.

, Living space is a frequently discussed factor when choosing a dog. While some smaller, low-energy dogs can exist in a smaller living environment, a high-energy breed will typically do better when it has a lot of room to move around your home and surrounding property.A fenced-in yard can provide dogs with plenty of room to run and explore.
If you do not have a fenced-in yard, you should have adequate space inside the house for your dog to roam.
If you live in an apartment, you may still be able to get a high-energy breed. However, you will need to provide that dog with a lot of daily exercise.

, High-energy dogs do not do well when left alone for long periods of time. They may become restless or even destructive. Even an average work day of 8 to 10 hours may be too long for some high-energy dog breeds to be left alone.It's best if you have a roommate, significant other, or a family member who can walk your dog and spend time with it while you're at work.
Never leave your dog alone in the yard while you're gone. A high-energy breed can easily dig under or jump over a fence if they feel restless and under-worked.
If you must leave a high-energy dog home alone, make sure you have a spacious dog-proof area for your dog and plenty of toys, including chewable objects.

, All dogs need plenty of exercise, but high-energy breeds will need even more time spent walking, running, or swimming each day. Without adequate exercise, your dog could develop behavioral problems, including destroying your home or harming itself.High-energy dogs need at least three walks each day lasting 10 to 30 minutes. Some dogs may need even more time spent exercising.
If you must leave your dog at home during the workday, give your dog a long walk before you leave and another long walk when you return home.Spend some time playing fetch with your dog throughout the week. This can help burn off energy and establish a good rapport between you and your pet.
Try taking your dog hiking on weekends if you're able to do so. This can help burn off a lot of energy and it allows your dog to feel like it's on the hunt.

, Nutrition is important for dogs. For high-energy dogs, the right kind of food is crucial. Your dog needs food that will help fuel its energy without causing dietary problems.Avoid high-protein dog food, as this can cause an already high-energy dog to have even more energy.
Feeding your dog the wrong type of food can also cause weight problems.
Opt for a good quality dog food that's low in protein. Ask your veterinarian for recommendations on brands or ingredients that would work best for your dog.

, Some high-energy dogs have a hard time following commands, particularly if they have not built a good rapport with their owners. Obedience lessons can help a high-energy dog bend to your will. With time and training, however, your dog will see you as the leader of the pack and defer to your commands.There are many different types of obedience classes available, so be sure to choose one that's right for your needs.Trainers may have certification, but many do not. There are no clear criteria for what education and experience a trainer must have.
Certified Professional Dog Trainers (CPDTs) are independently certified. They must reach a minimum number of hours working with dogs and must pass a standardized test.
Associate Certified Applied Animal Behaviorists (ACAABs) must hold a master's degree in animal behavior, while Certified Applied Animal Behaviorists (CAABs) must hold a doctoral degree.
Choose an obedience provider that works best for your dog. Ask your veterinarian for recommendations and be sure to ask about a given provider's credentials.

, Sometimes, despite your best efforts, your dog may get restless or frustrated with its environment and/or activity level. All dogs need daily exercise, but high-energy breeds need even more physical activity on a daily basis. They also need a clear sense of guidance from their owners. If any of those needs are not being met, your dog may act out or develop behavioral problems over time.Chasing its own tail, running in circles, biting (itself or the air), escaping, destroying the home, and excessive barking or whining are all signs that your dog is not getting its needs met."

The ASPCA estimates that in the first year of owning a large dog like a German Shepherd, you will spend about $1,843 on it.After the first year, you will spend about $875 every year. These numbers include medical costs, food, grooming, equipment (crates, toys, leashes), training, etc. If you cannot afford to properly care for a dog, you should wait until you can before adding one to your family.


Expect to pay between $500-$1200 and up for a quality German Shepherd puppy from a breeder. You will spend some money up front, but more money invested will save you in vet and other bills in the end. Buying a quality puppy ensures the support of a reputable breeder.
For more information on the pricing range in the USA, visit the German Shepherd Dog Club of America website.;
, Though German Shepherds are beautiful dogs, you want to make sure the breed is a good fit for your household. German Shepherds are a herding breed that were bred to move livestock around farms. Because they want to work, they need a lot of mental and physical stimulation to stay healthy and balanced. Without a way to expel energy, German Shepherds often grow unruly and destructive.


The breed is a great fit for owners who are looking for a lot of engagement and interaction with their pet.
If this is too much responsibility for you, you may want to look into other breeds.

, German Shepherds are large dogs. The American Kennel Club's (AKC) breed standard is 24-26"" to the highest point of the shoulder blade in males and 22-24"" in females.They can also be very high-energy pets, even beyond puppyhood. As such, training a German Shepherd is incredibly important if you don't want to get physically overwhelmed by your pet. Luckily, these are intelligent dogs who love to learn and work. They respond very well to training.

, The most obvious difference is that females will go into heat twice a year if left un-spayed. Females are also smaller and lighter than adult males, and have more delicate facial features.


Males can sometimes be more territorial than females. Scent marking can be controlled with proper training.Females may be more protective of their ""pack"" or family, though this may result in jealousy of other pets.

, The best way to learn about German Shepherds is to meet some in person. By attending a breed show, or ""conformation show,"" you will get to meet show-bred Shepherds and their breeders. These dogs are bred to make sure their physical traits adhere to the American Kennel Club's (AKC) breed standards.But if you're more interested in a dog bred for its herding or working ability, visit a show or trial that tests these skills. Examples include agility, obedience, Schutzhund (guard dog), and tracking competitions, among others.The working dogs are selected for traits like intelligence, ease of training, athletic ability and natural herding and working skills.
You can find wonderful German Shepherds of all types at agility, obedience, Schutzhund and tracking tests (and many other different types of competitions).
Contact The German Shepherd Club or AKC for a list of events where you can see and meet German Shepherds., Pure-bred dogs are rare in shelters, but with some patience you may be able to find a German Shepherd or German Shepherd mix. If you have trouble finding one through your local shelters, consider contacting a breed rescue in your area. Both of these options will allow you to rescue a dog in need of help, but in both cases, you cannot be sure of the dog's lineage. If you are set on a pure-bred German Shepherd that has a known lineage, then you will want to buy from a breeder.


Never buy a dog from a classified ad or website without first visiting the location and getting a sense for the owner. Don’t agree to meet the puppy off-site — you want to see the breeder’s premises.
Never buy a dog from a pet store. Pet stores often get puppies from puppy mills who breed without regard for the health or quality of the dogs. Dogs often live in poor conditions and are unhealthy. Do not support these practices with your money.
You might see puppies being sold on the side of the street. If they're not affiliated with an adoption agency, you should never buy puppies off the street. These are usually irresponsible breeders, and buying these puppies only encourages more irresponsible practices.

, Start on the internet by checking out national German Shepherd breed clubs like the German Shepherd Dog Club of America or the American Kennel Club. Both of these sites provide detailed information on what to look for in an ethical breeder, and can point you toward more local resources. Do further research into these local German Shepherd breed clubs in your area. Whether you get information from their websites or contact them directly for help, local breed clubs are a great way to get the names of reputable breeders in your area.

, Veterinarians come into contact with a lot of different types of animal care-givers, from breeders to shelters to individual owners. Because they know so much about animal issues in the community, it's a good idea to talk to a few vets in your area for ethical breeder recommendations.


Also consider speaking to other German Shepherd owners, dog groomers, or dog trainers.
If you visit a breed show, talk to owners and trainers about who they've had good or bad experiences with.

, Look for a breeder who specializes only in German Shepherds. Your best option is to find a breeder who has years of experience with the German Shepherd breed. They should be able to answer your questions about development, temperament, and training easily and without hesitation.

, Puppies need to be taught from an early age to live harmoniously with humans. If a breeder keeps litters isolated away from the home, the puppies will not be used to the sights and sounds of a normal household, and won't be used to human interaction. This can become a problem by the time they are old enough to be adopted.


Make sure the puppies spend at least some time in the breeders' home with them. The more time they spend with humans, the more you can trust the breeder.

, Mothers should also be given enough time to recover from pregnancies and being separated from their litters as they get adopted. Females should be healthy and alert. Never adopt a puppy from a breeder who breeds a young or unhealthy female, or who doesn't give mothers time to recover before breeding them again.


Puppies should never be sold or separated from their mothers before 8 weeks of age. Before that, it’s unsafe to wean them from their mothers.

, The breeder should have begun the puppies' vaccination and deworming processes before adopting them out. Make sure that's happened, and ask about any health problems the vet may have reported in these early checkups.

, Ask if the breeders have their dogs tested for the Degenerative Myelopathy (DM) gene. This can determine whether a common inherited disease in German Shepherds is present in the litter's bloodline. Dogs with DM suffer from progressive paralysis, particularly in the hind legs.Also ask the breeder whether the parents are ""OFA certified"" or ""AKC Registered."" You can ask to see certification for both parents from one of these organizations, but reputable breeders usually offer this without asking. Note that being AKC-registered does not mean that you are getting a healthy animal. It means that the owner paid money to the AKC to register the dog.


The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA), on the other hand, is interested in orthopedic and genetic health.German Shepherds commonly have hip and elbow dysplasia. While experts recommend against breeding animals with known genetic problems, an OFA certification will give you proof.
Be aware, though, that there's no guarantee of health in any animal. There's always a chance that two dogs free of known genetic diseases can still produce a puppy with genetic problems.

, The breeder should be evaluating you as a potential owner, just as you're evaluating him or her as a breeder. No good breeder will just hand over a puppy without being sure that the new owners will be able to provide it with a good, healthy life. Ask the breeder what they look for in a good owner, and whether they've ever turned potential owners away. The breeder should be able to answer these questions without even having to think about it.


You might also ask the breeder for references so you can contact other families who have dogs from previous litters.

, A reputable breeder should ask questions about your dog background and experience, your lifestyle, and your family to guide you in making the best decision. As difficult as it may be, a good breeder will be willing to turn you away if they think you're a bad fit for their particular puppies. For example, if the litter has particularly inactive parents, the puppies may not be a good fit for your highly active lifestyle. If you get turned away, ask if the breeder can point you to other options and litters so you can expand your search. Also ask if they have any unborn litters coming up that may be a better fit for you.


Be patient and don't get discouraged. With enough patience and legwork, you'll find the right puppy.
Don't lie to a breeder just to get a puppy, though. Trust the breeder's decision-making process. You don't want to end up with a dog who doesn't fit your needs.

, Avoid any breeder who offers to cut you a ""deal,"" who has unclean or smelly kennels, or who acts suspiciously in any way. Trust your instincts. A breeder who's in it just for the money has the wrong motivation, and likely isn't interested in the welfare of their dogs.


Make sure the dogs are not crowded into cages. They should have plenty of room to stumble around and explore their surroundings. Part of the time, puppies should be kept in the home to expose them to household environments.
There should be adequate food and water for all animals on the premises.
Kennels should be cleaned daily. Although it may be that a dog had an accident just before you arrived, be suspicious of a kennel that looks like it hasn't been cleaned recently.

, If a breeder doesn't have a return policy, it suggests they don't really care what happens to their dogs once they leave their property. That's not a good sign!


Also find out what kind of documentation you would get with your puppy. Would you get registration papers and pedigree papers?

, Negotiate for what you want if it's not included in the contract. Be very wary of a breeder who will not discuss the chance that a puppy may need to be returned.


Does the contract require you to take the puppy for a vet visit within a set time?
Does it cover hereditary issues for life? For only a certain period of time?
What kind of documentation will you need to provide to “prove” your case?
What does the breeder agree to offer? 100% money back? Trade for another puppy when one is available?
Are there restrictions on the activities you can do with your dog that will invalidate the contract or guarantee?
Are you purchasing a show prospect puppy or a pet quality animal?
Does the breeder have strong feelings (or even bans) about the vaccinations, foods or supplements for your puppy? Are these opinions based on solid science?

, You can find breed rescues by searching for them online, or by contacting your local humane society, dog officer, or vet's office. Many pet-related businesses will be able to provide information about local rescue organizations.


Don't forget about talking to German Shepherd owners or visiting breed shows to meet more owners.

, Any puppy coming from a rescue should be fully checked by a veterinarian for basic health, parasites and vaccinations before they are adopted. Generally, they will be spayed or neutered before they go to their new homes, or you will sign a contract to do so in the near future. Beware of any rescue group who skips these steps.

, Many rescue groups have an extensive placement process.They will require an application, an interview, and a home visit to ensure a successful adoption. Some may even ask to consult your current veterinarian for information about you and previous pets. If you don’t own your home, be prepared to provide a letter from your landlord stating that you are allowed to have a dog. If you already have another dog, that dog will need to be evaluated to make sure that the dogs will get along.


While this may seem excessive, the rescue group just wants to place the dog with a family in a home that's prepared to handle the responsibility.

, Like all breeds, the German Shepherd suffers from many inheritable diseases that you can't see just by looking at the dog. Common genetic diseases for the breed include degenerative myelopathy, megaesophagus, and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.If you're getting your puppy from a breeder, they should know about the history of disease in the puppy's lineage. Discuss the likelihood of these diseases developing in your own puppy.

, You want to see the puppy on multiple occasions, if possible, so you can get a better sense of its overall temperament and health. Just like people, puppies can have their good days and their bad days, so you don't want to make a decision based on a single interactions.

, Take your time and look closely at each puppy you're thinking of adopting. Puppies should be the appropriate weight — not too chubby, but not too thin — and odor free. They should have clear eyes (not runny or red) and clean ears. The coat should be full and glossy (no balding spots), and free of mats or fecal matter. Look for signs of excessive scratching, which may point to skin or coat problems. It should have a healthy appetite, and no signs of vomiting or diarrhea.


Also assess the puppy's social health. Puppies should be curious and well-socialized, playful and friendly.

, Temperament testing a dog or puppy helps you choose a dog that fits your family and lifestyle.For example, a high-energy puppy may be the right fit for an active outdoor family, but wrong for a family who likes to relax indoors. For temperament testing, separate the puppy from the litter to make sure it's focusing its attention on you.


Walk around to see if the puppy follows you. A puppy that follows humans is well-socialized to them and enjoys their company.
Kneel and call the puppy to you. It should show interest in you and come when called.
Lift the puppy in the air to see how well it deals with being carried.
Gently restrain the puppy with its belly up. Though a little bit of struggle is okay, you don't want a puppy who fights you when you try to handle it. Look for a puppy that isn't afraid —note if his tail is between his legs.
In all interactions, look for signs of fear or mistrust. These puppies may not adjust well to your home.

, If you see a puppy who guards its food or toys, think twice about adopting it. While these behaviors can be improved through training, it's an extra obstacle you don't have to face if you choose a dog with a better temperament. Look for behaviors like growling or snapping when people or other dogs approach their food or toys. A dog who runs away may also have problems interacting safely and comfortably in a home.


If you decide to take on a “project” with behavioral concerns, make sure you have a behaviorist or trainer you trust lined up first.
Beware that having a ""reactive"" dog will add to the potential liability of ownership.

, You want a puppy that's playful and not fearful because many dogs bite out of fear. German Shepherds are large, powerful animals as adults, so you absolutely cannot start out with a puppy who's fearful by nature. Puppies born with a fearful personality may be harder to train, and may display fear aggression as adults., You may visit a litter and fall in love with a puppy a few states away. If you cannot take the dog home immediately (for example, if it's too young to be weaned), you need to arrange for its transportation at a later date. For the puppy's health, you should make the trip to pick it up yourself. Shipping puppies is very stressful on them, and often results in a sick puppy when you pick them up from the airport.


If you want a puppy that lives far away, be willing to travel for it.

Change your dog's activity level.,
Monitor the condition.,
Take fainting spells and difficulty breathing very seriously.",How to Treat Aortic Stenosis in German Shorthaired Pointers3," In dogs with mild or moderate aortic stenosis, veterinary treatment is typically not performed. Such cases can usually be controlled with lifestyle changes. Basically, you will need to control your dog's activity level to adjust for its decreased ability to get sufficient oxygen.


Dogs with a mild case tend to have a good prognosis and live a generally typical lifespan. However, exercise regimes may need to be curtailed depending on the dog’s tolerance to exercise.
For example, a German shorthaired pointer that is expected to be a hunting dog may not be able to perform at maximal efficiency. However, it can still engage in some restricted form of hunting sport, as long as its heart health is closely monitored.

, If your dog is diagnosed with aortic stenosis, the dog's heart health will need to be monitored for the rest of its life. Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for when and how often your dog should be brought in for checkups or treatment.If your dog is on medication for its aortic stenosis, then a checkup is important so that its veterinarian can adjust its medication.
Getting good veterinary care is key to your German shorthaired pointer living a long and relatively healthy life with aortic stenosis.

, If your dog has been diagnosed with aortic stenosis, even if it is a very mild case that does not require medication, episodes of fainting or difficulty breathing are very serious. Take your dog to its veterinarian immediately if this happens.Even if your dog recovers quickly from difficulty breathing or a fainting spell, it still needs to be seen by a veterinarian immediately.

Find out if you can have a pet.,
Consider the size of a potential dog breed.,
Assess whether your space is suitable for a dog.,
Consider whether you have the ability to easily take a dog outside.,
Think about your neighbors.",How to Choose a Dog Suitable for Your Living Space1," If you live in an apartment you may not be able to have any pets, let alone a dog. Review your lease or rental agreement and see if it addresses whether or not you can have a dog in your rental.


If your lease or rental agreement doesn't address pets, or if you can't find a copy of it, then you will need to contact your landlord to find out if pets are allowed.
Even if you can have pets, your landlord may increase your rent if you have a pet and he or she may have you sign a pet agreement. These pet agreements usually state that you will have control over your pet at all times and pay for any damages that your pet may incur.;
, When deciding what kind of dog will be suitable for your living space, you need to think about whether a potential dog breed will fit comfortably in that space. A large dog in a small apartment, for instance, may have a hard time navigating the space and moving around freely.


Space can be especially important if you have a lot of breakable or fragile items in a small home. A big dog in a small space will probably unintentionally knock things over just because there isn't space for them to move.
This is not to say that a large or medium sized dog cannot be happy in an apartment. There are some large breeds that can be very content in a relatively small home. These tend to be large breeds that have low energy levels, such as mastiffs and great Danes.Remember that all dogs grow up. This means that a tiny puppy that seems to fit easily in your apartment may not fit so nicely when it is all grown up. Take this into consideration when picking a breed., Even if you are allowed to have a dog in your home, it doesn't mean that you have a space that will work well for one. Think about your home and whether you can make it a safe and comfortable place for another creature besides yourself.


Homes that have a lot of hazards that cannot be changed may not be suitable for certain dogs. For example, if you live in an untraditional home, such as a boat, it may be hard to have a dog.

, This will need to happen several times every day at the least. This means that if you will have a hard time finding outdoor space for the dog or getting the dog outside this should influence your decision to get a dog.


For example, if you live in a fifth floor walk up, it may be hard for you to take the dog out several times every day.
Even if you have a dog that doesn't need a lot of walking, it will still need regular short walks. All dogs deserve a daily walk and fresh air.

, You may also want to think about your neighbors when assessing whether your home is suitable for a dog. A dog that is known to run around a lot and bark, such as a Jack Russell terrier, may cause a lot of noise for neighbors that live next to you or below you.


Considering your neighbors may influence your choice of dog breed more than whether or not to get a dog at all.

Calculate the cost.,
Select a dog that works in the senior's living situation.,
Develop a plan for the dog if the person passes away.",How to Choose a Dog Suitable for Senior Citizens1," When choosing a dog for a senior citizen it is important to discuss what he or she wants in a dog. This pet is for someone else, so their wishes should be central to any choice that you make.


Discuss what the person's ideal dog looks like, what they think they can do physically in relation to dog care, and if they have any reservations or concerns about getting a dog.
Adopting a dog is a big decision that comes with a lot of responsibilities. This means that you should make sure that the senior citizen is excited and ready to care for a dog. Getting a dog as a surprise for a senior citizen is not a good idea.;
, You need to consider the senior citizen's physical strength and agility when picking out a dog for them. A senior citizen that is active and mobile can probably handle a dog that needs daily walks and play time and is relatively large. However, if the senior citizen does not have a lot of strength and cannot walk very far, you will need to find a dog that will not overwhelm them physically and can get its exercise inside the house.Having realistic expectations of what the senior citizen can and can't do for a dog is very important. Getting a dog that requires too much physical activity for them will set them up for trouble.
If the senior citizen has severe medical issues or is at risk for falls, then getting a dog for them may not be the best idea. The dog may put them at an increased risk of falls or injury due to minor scratches from playing with the pet.

, When trying to choose a dog you should also take cost into consideration. If the senior citizen has a limited income and doesn't want to spend very much money on the dog and dog care, then a smaller dog might be a good option.The lower cost of a small dog is due to the fact that a smaller dog costs less to feed. Over its lifetime, feeding a small dog versus a large dog can save you thousands of dollars.
However, the cost of grooming can increase the cost of a small dog tremendously.
Keep in mind that regardless of size, every dog will need routine veterinary care such as immunizations, blood tests, preventative medications such as heartworm tablets, dental care (especially for small dogs), and possibly even emergency treatment.

, Whatever living situation the senior citizen is in, they can probably have a dog. For example, a little dog that is content in a small space will be good for a senior citizen living in a small apartment, while a large, energetic dog will not.


If the senior citizen is living in a care facility, such as assisted living, there are usually rules about whether pets are allowed or not. In many cases, there are restrictions limiting the size of dogs allowed in the facility.

, Although it is not pleasant to think about, it is possible that the dog will outlive their senior citizen owner. If this happens, make sure there is a plan in place for who will care for the dog so that the dog does not end up homeless or being cared for by someone who does not want a dog.

For example, is there a family member or close friend who is willing and able to care for the dog if the person passes away? Making these arrangements can offer the senior citizen dog owner some peace of mind about the well-being of their dog after they are gone.

Meet potential dogs.,
Discuss the dog with your spouse.,

Split duties relatively evenly.",How to Choose a Dog Together As a Married Couple," Tell your spouse what you would like to do with a dog. For example, say ""I would love a dog that I can take on walks and that will snuggle with me on the couch."" Talk about personality aspects you love, looks you find appealing, and what you look forward to doing with your future dog.


This is a chance for you to make your case about what kind of dog you think the family should get.
You may want to do some research on dog breeds before you discuss the issue with your partner. Figure out what you should consider and what you like ahead of time.This could include exercise needs, grooming needs, potential health problems, and temperament.;
, Once you have told your spouse what you want in a dog, give him or her a chance to make the case for what they want. Since they have taken the time to listen to your desires, you should give them the opportunity to express their desires as well.


Ask your spouse what they want. Say, ""I've told you what I want to do with a dog. Now I would love to know what you look forward to doing with a dog.""
While your spouse is talking, pay attention and don't interrupt. You should take note, however, on what points you agree on and what you don't agree on.

, In some cases, you and your spouse will agree on what type of dog to get. However, it is more likely that you will agree on some things you want in a potential dog and disagree on others. To stay focused and make forward progress on your decision, make a list of what you agree and don't agree on. This will help you to focus on what needs to be discussed further.In order to know what you agree and don't agree on, you will need to start by making a list of all of the aspects of a dog that need to be decided on. This means things like size and coat length, as well as personality traits and temperament.

, Since you are making the decision together, you may need to compromise on some of your desires. Tell your spouse what you think is most important to you and what you are willing to compromise on. Ask your spouse if there is an aspect that you disagree with that he or she would be willing to compromise on.


Compromise goes both ways. Make it clear that you expect your partner to compromise if you are willing to do the same.Say ""I have compromised on the size of dog to get. Can you compromise on the breed that you want?""
Sometimes compromise ends up being a middle ground that neither of you would have picked on your own. For example, if your spouse wants a very large dog and you want a tiny dog, perhaps the compromise is to get a medium sized dog.

, Come to an agreement about what type of dog you will get. Depending on how different your desired dog is from your partner's desired dog, this can be a long process. Just remember, you are adding a new member to your family and that is a big decision, so the ultimate outcome should be exciting and agreeable to both people.


If you can't come to a decision, then you may need to delay getting a dog. Ending up with a dog that one of you is not invested in could create unnecessary and unhealthy tension in your relationship.
This agreement will ultimately be a wish list of things you will look for in a dog. When you are out looking at actual dogs, this agreement may need to be adjusted based on the dogs you meet and how high your initial expectations are., Discuss whether to get a rescue dog or a dog from a breeder. Look online for organizations in your area and read their websites to narrow down your search. Looking at potential dogs online can be a fun and exciting project to do together.


Not all breeders will have dogs that are immediately available for adoption. Take this into consideration if you want to adopt from a breeder.
Dogs that are at a rescue organization or a shelter are largely in desperate need of a home, so you would be potentially saving a life by adopting from this type of organization., Go to see potential dogs together. Spend some time with the dog, assessing its temperament and health, as well as the conditions it was raised in. If the dog is at a shelter or rescue organization, discuss the dog's behavior and history with workers there. Overall, get as much information as you can in addition to assessing the dog for yourself.


Just because you made a list of desirable parameters together, that doesn't mean that one of you gets to make the final decision alone. Instead, you should work as a team throughout the entire process of adopting a dog.

, After you meet a potential dog, you should take some time to discuss the dog with your spouse. Talk about how the dog does or doesn't fulfill what you decided together and whether any differences are ok.For example, you might say ""I loved the looks of that dog and how well behaved it was on a leash. I didn't love how much barking it did and that it jumped up on everyone it met.""


Don't just agree to adopt the dog on the spot without discussing it. Even if you are head-over-heels in love with the dog, making the decision together requires that you take the time to hear your partner's perspective.
This discussion can potentially be a point of conflict if one partner loves a dog and the other doesn't. However, if both people do not want a specific dog, then it is not the right dog for them as a couple.
If you want a dog but your spouse doesn't, then you will need to try and convince your spouse that this dog is the right one. This can be most convincing if you can go back to your discussion and decision about dog type and illustrate how well this potential dog fits the parameters you came up with together.

, Once you have both agreed that you have found the right dog, then you can move forward with the adoption process. Contact the breeder, shelter, or rescue organization that you would like to adopt the dog from. Go together with your spouse to pick up your new dog.Making a joint decision will mean that you are both invested in the new dog. Hopefully this will make the transition with the new dog easier, as both people will want to spend time with the dog and you can share in the tasks associated with caring for it.

, It can be very exciting to get a new dog and, in some cases, this means spoiling it silly. In order to avoid this, make a budget of how much you will spend on the dog and what you will spend your money on.


Remember to include a budget for unexpected expenses, such as veterinary costs, so that you have the money set aside to care for the dog in case of emergency.
You can find approximate yearly dog care costs online.It is good to start with one of these and then adjust the budget once you have the actual dog and know the actual costs involved with caring for it.

, It is important that, after choosing the dog together, you care for it together as well. Make an agreement about who will do what dog care and when they will do it. This may mean that you rotate jobs on a weekly or monthly basis or that each of you has set jobs that are agreed upon.


Some jobs that will need to be done include walking, feeding, grooming, and cleaning the house.
Sometimes set jobs work out well, especially if one person hates a chore that the other person doesn't mind. Remember, however, that these jobs need to be agreed upon and they should be open to discussion later on if one person really wants a change.

, Even if you are doing different chores associated with the dog, you and your spouse can split them up relatively evenly. However, the only way that you can come to an agreement about what ""evenly"" looks like, will be to discuss it and compromise with your partner.


Even if you think duties are divided evenly, that doesn't mean your partner will agree. This is why a discussion is so important.
If there are children in your family, you can also get them involved in caring for the dog. Give all children in the family age-appropriate chores to do related to the dog.For example, kids that are school aged are usually old enough to be responsible for feeding a dog. You will, however, need to make sure that they actually do it.

Think about the energy level of a potential dog breed.,
Take personality into consideration.,
Determine allowable breeds.,
Decide on a breed.",How to Choose a Dog Suitable for Your Living Space2," Even if you have enough room for a dog to move around at a normal pace, that doesn't mean that there is enough room for a dog with a lot of energy. For instance, a wild terrier that loves to run around may tear up your small apartment with no yard pretty quick. When considering breeds, take their general energy level and how that would function in your home into consideration.Many medium-sized dogs have a ton of energy and thus should have more room to run around and play. For example, an Australian cattle dog has a lot of energy and will do well with room to play and run around., There are some dog breeds that do best when allowed to roam around outside or when they are taken out into nature. For instance, herding dogs, such as cattle dogs and collies, thrive when given a lot of time outdoors running and playing. If your living situation does not allow for this, then maybe you should choose a different breed.If you love to do outdoor activities but you live in a small apartment, then you will need to find a breed that is capable of all the activities you want to do but that will function well in a small home. A medium-sized dog with moderate energy, such as a beagle, may be a good fit for you., Some landlords limit the kinds of dogs you can have in their buildings, even if they allow dogs in general. This limitation usually says that so called ""aggressive"" breeds are not allowed. This rule likely restricts pit bulls and pit bull mixes, Rottweilers, German shepherds, and Doberman Pinschers from residing in the building.


If your landlord is serious about breed restrictions then you may need to prove your dog's lineage before it's allowed to reside in your home. This is especially true if it looks like it could be partially a restricted breed.
Even if you own your home, having a certain breed of dog could impact your costs. Having a so-called ""aggressive"" breed could increase your homeowners insurance rates, or even may you uninsurable.Check with your insurance company to see if they have any restrictions associated with dog breeds.

, Make a list of all of your considerations and what breeds might work for you, given your parameters. This may take some research on your part to figure out what dog breeds have what characteristics. Once you have a list of breeds that you think will be suitable for your living situation, then you can start the search for your specific dog.


Try looking at online lists of dog breeds and their characteristics to narrow down your choices.When you find a potential dog, make sure that it meets all of your necessary criteria. If it doesn't, keep looking instead of getting a dog that will be uncomfortable in its new home.

Figure out what role you want the dog to play.,
Consider the age of your potential dog.,
Pick a place to get your dog.",How to Choose a Dog Suitable for Your Living Space3," Do you want a guard dog, a lap dog, or a dog to go on long hikes with? Do you want a dog that will interact with other dogs freely or a dog that likes to play games? Figure out what role you most want your dog to play and focus on that while choosing your dog.


Research what breeds fit these priorities and choose from them. Don't assume any dog can be a lap dog or a guard dog, for example.
A dog can fulfill several roles for you of course. For instance, a herding dog such as a collie can be great for training and tricks but can also be a lap dog at times. Just be sure to understand what you want out of your dog and to balance those expectations with an understanding that one dog may not be able to fulfill all of your desires., Decide whether you want a puppy or an adult dog that already has some training. This decision depends on whether it is important to you to have a dog from puppyhood, or if you would like to give an adult dog a home.Both of these choices have good and bad aspects. For instance, a new puppy is a lot of work to raise but you will get to do all of the training and mold its behavior. An adult dog is typically less work to care for but may have bad habits that are hard to break, due to someone else raising it when it was a baby.

, In addition to deciding what type of dog to get, you will also need to figure out where to get one. It may be a priority for you to get a dog that needs a good home. Going to your local shelter or rescue organization will assure that you go home with a dog that is in desperate need of a home.Do an online search for the organizations in your area. There are probably small rescue organizations that foster dogs in member's homes. There are also probably large organizations, such as the Humane Society, that have large facilities to house dogs in. Once you have identified all of these organizations, then look at their websites for lists of adoptable dogs.
If you really want to get a young puppy, it will be harder to adopt one from a shelter or rescue organization. They are very in demand and get adopted very quickly. Instead, you may need to go to a dog breeder to get a puppy.

Research breed energy levels.,
Familiarize yourself with breed care requirements.,
Take the dog's age into consideration.,
Look for dogs to adopt.,
Meet and evaluate potential dogs.",How to Choose a Dog Suitable for Senior Citizens2," Depending the senior citizen's physical strength and stamina, you may need a dog with medium to low energy. There are some dogs that truly do need a lot of exercise and this can be too much for a senior citizen to provide.You can find information on dog breed characteristics on the websites of dog appreciation groups, such as the American Kennel Club.Getting a dog that matches the senior citizen's energy and physical activity level is one of the most important considerations you can make. A suitable dog will be a good companion for the senior citizen, not a burden or danger to them.
Remember that a dog doesn't have to be just a couch potato or a high-energy tornado. Many dogs, for example the Welsh corgi, have medium energy levels that are great for active senior citizens.

, Some dog breeds take more work to care for than others. Factors that can create a lot of work include coat type and length, overall size, and temperament.


Along with being cheaper, small dogs are generally easier to care for and to manage physically. This is another reason why smaller dogs, such as toy poodles and Maltese, are generally better for senior citizens., In many cases, older dogs are good matches for older people. They are usually already trained and do not have the energy of a young dog or puppy.Above all, adult and senior dogs just don't take as much energy and patience to care for as puppies do.


Very old dogs can have health considerations of their own that can be difficult for senior citizens to manage. A dog with bladder problems or mobility issues, for instance, may or may not be too much for a senior citizen to handle.

, A great place to meet a lot of potential dogs is at a rescue organization. Rescued dogs are great for senior citizens because they are usually adult or senior dogs, they are often already trained, and they can benefit greatly from getting a new home.There are also senior dog adoption programs that can be great for matching senior citizens with dogs that would be appropriate for them.Some of these programs can also assist in the financial cost of adoption and care if the senior citizen who wants a dog is on a fixed income., Even if all of your research points you towards a specific breed of dog, you need to assess each dog individually. Every dog is different and you need to meet and spend time with a dog to know if it is right for a senior citizen.


Spend some time with the dog and try to judge its temperament. Is the dog calm when meeting new people or when it hears loud noises? Does it have interest in you and want to engage? Assessing its personality and behavior can give you insight into how it would function as a dog for a senior citizen.

Bring a ball to play fetch with.",How to Choose a Dog Breed Good at Fetch," Border collies and other herding dogs are playful, smart, and energetic. Most will love to fetch and spend hours playing if you let them. As an added bonus, they are very trainable, as long as you work with them to learn new skills.Another dog in this category is the Australian cattle dog. Like border collies, they are herding dogs, and they are energetic and very smart. Often these dogs will attach particularly to one family member.
Another similar breed is the Australian shepherd.;
, Golden retrievers are known for their friendliness and intelligence. Because of these qualities, they make great family dogs. They are also known for their retrieving skills (hence, the name), making them a great breed for learning to play fetch.Standard poodles also make a good choice for families, as they like to be around people.Poodles are actually very athletic and love to play, which makes them a good choice for learning fetch.While poodles aren't currently classified by the American Kennel Club or the Canadian Kennel Club as retrievers, the American Kennel Club did so in the 19th century. Traditionally, however, this dog has been seen as a sporting dog and is still classified as such by the United Kennel Club., This breed got its name (from Theodore Roosevelt, no less) because of its ability to hunt down small rodents. These dogs make great fetchers because of their hunting nature. They're also smaller than some of the other breeds that make good fetchers.A similar dog to the rat terrier is a the miniature schnauzer, a dog bred to work on German farms hunting for rodents. Schnauzers are more people-pleasers than rat terriers, though., Medium-sized hunters like English springer spaniels are also great at fetching. They have a good deal of energy and love to run and play with their families, and they top out at about 45 pounds., These dogs were bred to work on farms, so they can enjoy a good game of fetch. However, they tend to be calmer than other fetch-loving breeds, and they are great option for families, since they love to be around people., Getting a high-energy medium-to-large dog in an apartment may not be the best idea. Of course, it also depends on how much time you're willing to devote to the dog. If you have time to take the dog for long walks or runs every day, this type of breed make work for you.Even medium-sized hunting dogs, such as the English springer spaniel, will need to be walked or exercised regularly., Dogs like border collies require a lot of attention and devotion. Because they are so smart, they get bored easily if left to their own devices, and they can become destructive. Make sure you have the resources and energy to devote to this type of dog if you decide to adopt one.Also, herders can turn to nipping if they are trying to herd things, and they will herd anything, from cats to kids to cars.

, Golden retrievers can be great family dogs as they are very friendly. However, that friendliness can also lead to a downside: they stay in puppy mentality for longer than other breeds, up to 4 years. Sometimes, these dogs stay puppy-like well into adulthood. While that's a pleasing quality to some, others may find it tiresome.Like border collies, golden retrievers require a lot of exercise and attention.

, While rat terriers are smaller than say, a border collie or golden retriever, they don't have the same desire to please their humans as these other dogs. Because of this trait, they can take a bit more training and socialization to incorporate them into a family., A Bernese mountain dog is a very large dog. It can reach up to 100 pounds, so it needs a lot of space to roam around and enjoys exercise. You'll also find the dog food bills more expensive., When picking out a dog, an important factor is paying attention to how the dog interacts with you and your family. Going by yourself to pick out a dog can be problematic if the dog doesn't like children (and you have them) or the dog is intimidated by your husband.If the dog seems playful with one member of your family but growls and backs away from another, that could be problematic.
Ask questions about the dog, as some dogs have had previous owners, which can tell you important information about who the dog will get along with.
In addition, make sure you get up and close and personal with the dog. That is, pet and engage with the dog to see how it handles being touched.

, Both your age and the dog's age are important to consider when picking a dog. That is, if you're older, you may not want a high-energy dog that requires walking two or three times a day. Similarly, while puppies are cute, dogs that young require a lot of work, and you'll need to be able to devote a good amount of time to them when they are young. An elderly dog may not be right if you are looking for one that is enthusiastic about playing., A playful dog is more likely to want to play fetch and other games with you. A dog that hangs back and hugs the corner is more likely to be a good cuddle buddy. Therefore, if you're looking for a dog that wants to play fetch, pick one that bounces up to you and greets you immediately., Another option is to simply try playing fetch with the dog. Once you've narrowed down your choices, see if your choice seems to enjoy playing fetch with the ball. Keep in mind, though, that it may be a learning curve for some dogs.

Assess your climate.,
Research dog breeds.,
Create a care plan.",How to Choose a Dog Suitable for Your Climate1," In order to figure out what kind of dog will be suitable for your climate, you should figure out what about your climate might be difficult for a dog. What are the extremes of your climate and how might they impact your new furry companion? Answering these questions for yourself will help steer your research into different dog breeds.


For example, heat and cold are the most clear aspects of climate that might impact a dog. If you live in a hot area, a dog might have difficulty if its coat is too thick and warm. If you live in a cold area, a dog will need to be able to stay warm, so it will need a thick coat of fur.;
, Once you understand the limitations of your climate, you can start looking for breeds that might be a good fit. If you have not identified many difficulties a dog would face from your climate, then you will clearly have more breed options to choose from.


Look at descriptions of different dog breeds online. These can be found on the websites of dog breed groups and kennel associations.You will need to take other factors into consideration as well, not just your climate. Think about what you want out of a dog, what personality you like, and what activity level would most match your lifestyle.

, While it is true that some dog breeds are more suited to one climate or another, that doesn't mean that you cannot have one in a climate it is not suited to. This just means that you will have to do a lot of work to make the dog comfortable and healthy in your climate.Thinking about the dog breed you want and the climate you live in, identify possible problems and how will you alleviate that problems with specific care.


For example, if you want a thick furred dog in a hot climate, you will need to work very hard to keep it cool. This will include not taking it out in the heat of the day and making your home cold enough for it to be comfortable.

Identify breeds without a dense undercoat.,
Pick a breed that traditionally live in warm climates.,
Choose a dog that can breathe easily.,
Select a small breed dog.,
Avoid shaving your dog's coat if you live in a warm climate.",How to Choose a Dog Suitable for Your Climate2," Figure out if a breed you are interested in has a double or a single coat. Dogs with double coats have a coat of longer guard hairs and a thick blanket of fur beneath.This undercoat protects them from the cold but it also means that they can be prone to overheating.A thinner coat will allow heat to dissipate off the dog more easily.

, If you are concerned about getting a dog that is appropriate for your climate, then figure out what ones normally live in your climate. Just as there are dogs that have been bred in very cold weather, there are dogs that have been bred in hot weather as well.


One example of a dog bred for hot weather is the Basenji. The Basenji is a hunting dog that was bred in Egypt but that has become popular elsewhere in the world., Dogs with shorter snouts can have a hard time breathing and this is especially true when they get overheated. With this in mind, its best to choose a breed that does not have this kind of breathing issue if you live in a hot climate. This means that the English bulldog, the pekingese, the pug, and the boxer all could have a hard time living in a hot climate.A dog with a longer snout, like a greyhound or a fox terrier for instance, will have a much easier time breathing when it is warm or even when it is overheated.

, Large breed dogs, such as Mastiffs and St. Bernards, can have a hard time in a consistently warm climate. Their large bodies have a harder time eliminating heat. Small dogs, on the other hand, tend to be able to cool themselves off more quickly and easily.


Many short-haired, medium-sized dogs do well in warm climates. These include beagles, greyhounds, terriers, and hounds, among others.

, Shaving your dog will put them at risk for sunburn.If your dog requires regular coat trims, make sure not to shave all of the hair away. Just trim your dog's fur. Having some fur will help to protect your dog's skin from the sun."

Choose a breed with a thick coat.,
Research breeds that are traditional for cold climates.,
Plan out ways to protect a dog from the cold.",How to Choose a Dog Suitable for Your Climate3," In order to thrive in a cold climate, a dog must be able to stay warm and toasty. Dogs with thick coats, usually a double coat of under fur and top fur, will be better protected from the cold because they will be able to keep their core temperature warmer.Dogs that are traditionally kept in very cold places, like the Alaskan malamute or the Bernese mountain dog, thrive in cold weather in large part because of their coats. A thick double coat protects their core from losing heat, just as a thick jacket would for you.

, There is a reason that Siberian huskies, American Eskimos, Samoyed, and Icelandic Sheepdogs are known for thriving in the cold. They are built for cold weather with their thick coats and their sturdy dispositions. If you live in a cold area and want a dog breed to match, consider these breeds.This is not to say that you can only have a dog in a cold climate that is known for thriving there. However, it does mean that having that kind of dog will be a lot easier because you will not have to protect it from the cold as much as you would a dog that is not made for the cold.

, Depending on just how cold your climate is, you may be able to protect just about any breed of dog from the cold. If you keep your dog inside most of the time, put protective clothing on it, and protect its paws from ice and snow, most dogs can live in a cold climate.However, there are some breeds that have delicate constitutions and they cannot handle extremes of temperature.

Research each breed’s health needs.Every breed of dog comes with its own set of known health problems.For example, because they have been bred to have very flat faces and bulging eyes, pugs are known to have frequent eye injuries and chronic irritation and pain.The Great Dane's immense size and deep chest often causes painful bloating and twisting in the stomach that needs immediate medical care.,
Think about how much maintenance you can handle.,
Decide whether you want a purebred or a hybrid ""mutt."",
Choose a dog of the right age.,
Meet with potential dogs.,
Find out the owner’s criteria for making dogs available for adoption.,
Ask about each dog's behavior.,
Make an initial evaluation of all dogs available for adoption.,
Introduce the dog to all members of the household.,
Take special care to check the dog’s behavior with children.This is especially important if you already have small children in your household, but also crucial if you plan on having children in the future.,
Inquire about the dog’s parents.,
Set up a temporary foster situation if necessary.",How to Choose a Dog," You don’t want to end up in a situation where you either have to move or rehouse your pet because of a leasing dispute. Don’t try to “sneak” in a dog — they are impossible to hide, and you may find yourself in hot water with the landlord. Keep in mind that you may have to pay an extra pet deposit or cleaning fee to bring a dog into a rental unit.;
, Some areas — cities, counties, or states — ban specific breeds of dog, and you must be aware of what is or is not allowed in your region.Look up “breed-specific legislation” or “dangerous dog ordinances” in your state to find out whether or not there are any restrictions on what types of dogs you can bring into your home.For example, the city of Fitzgerald, Georgia allows existing pit bulls to remain in the city, but has banned owners from bringing new pit bulls into the area.Contact your insurance company, as well, to see if they will make you buy additional insurance for bringing specific breeds into your home. Commonly blacklisted breeds include:Pit Bull Terriers
Staffordshire Terriers
Rottweilers
German Shepherds
Presa Canarios
Chows Chows
Doberman Pinschers
Akitas
Wolf-hybrids
Mastiffs
Cane Corsos
Great Danes
Alaskan Malamutes
Siberian Huskies

, Think about the people and other pets that you already live with. If you have a roommate or family member who is allergic to dogs, doesn’t like them, or simply does not want one, this problem will need to be resolved. Similarly, if you have other pets that are not compatible with dogs, you may not be able to provide a good home for one. Don’t bring a dog into a home where it might be met with fear or hostility.

, If you work long hours with a lengthy commute, you likely won't have enough time to spend with a dog. If dogs don't get enough attention from their human “pack” members, they can become destructive or very unhappy. Attention means more than just love and affection.


Are you able to give a dog enough exercise to keep it mentally and physically happy?
Are you willing to wake up early to let the dog out to relieve itself?
Does your work or lifestyle involve a lot of traveling that would take you way from the dog?
If so, can you afford boarding costs? Do you have a friend or relative willing to watch your dog while you're away?

, Depending on the breed you choose, your dog might live anywhere from 5 to 15 years.You will have to spend money to care for your pet for the duration of its life, so make sure you can afford the investment before bringing a dog into your home.


The ASPCA estimates that in the first year of adopting a puppy, owners of small breeds will spend around $1,314, medium-breed owners around $1,580, and large-breed owners around $1,843.These costs include one-time initial veterinary care like vaccines and spaying/neutering, and the purchasing of equipment like crates, carrying bags, and leases, etc.
After the first year, the price goes down. Since you’re only paying for regular vet visits, food, toys, and licensing, owners of small dogs will pay about $580 per year, medium dogs about $695, and large dogs about $875.

, Once you’ve done your initial research and decided you can get a dog, you need to decide what size of dog is best for you. If you have only a small amount of space, you may not want to get a very large dog. In some cases, even apartments that allow dogs put a cap on dog size. Think about what you want — a little lap dog to curl up on your legs, or a big dog to scare off potential intruders?

, Because dogs have been bred for wildly different purposes over the course of many centuries, they have very different exercise needs. In general, herding breeds (collies, sheepdogs), working breeds (German shepherd) and hunting breeds (Labradors, pointers) need a lot of exercise and room.Even the smallest dogs like Maltese and Chihuahuas need some daily exercise. There are, of course, breeds known for their low exercise needs, including large dogs like Neapolitan mastiffs and small dogs like Pomeranians.If you have an active lifestyle, you may want to choose an active breed to go on long jogs or hikes with you.
If you prefer to curl up on the couch with a movie, choose a breed that will be content your laid back lifestyle.

, A dog’s breed can have a significant impact on its personality. Some breeds, like Weimaraners, are simply too large and high-energy to have around small children — they may play too hard.Others, like Akitas, have short tempers and might bite excitable children who don't know how to interact with them.Research the temperaments of all the breeds you're considering to find out whether they would make a good match for your family.Use the American Kennel Club or another breed registry to get an idea of each breed’s particular characteristics., They also suffer from hip and elbow dysplasia.You have to decide if a given breed's health risks are acceptable to you.


Because “mutts” have more genetic variation, they tend to be healthier than purebred dogs.If you don’t want to deal with a high risk of genetic problems, consider avoid purebred dogs.

, Long-haired breeds like Collies may be beautiful, but they require frequent daily brushing to keep their hair free from tangles and snarls. Tangles aren't just ugly — they can turn into painful hair mats that cause pain, irritation, and even bleeding and infection.Short-haired breeds will only need infrequent brushings, and might be a better choice for an owner who doesn't want to spend a lot of time on grooming.


Consider, too, whether you're willing to clean up all the shed fur from a long-haired dog.
The poodle is considered to be a non-shedding dog. However, it is a dog that needs frequent appointments at the groomers to keep its hair from matting.
Other breeds also will need professional groom to maintain a proper coat.

, A purebred dog will give you a better sense of what their temperament will be like, since dogs often take after their parents. If you purchase a dog from a breeder, you’ll also have better access to the dog’s genealogy and medical history, which will help you foresee health problems. However, if you aren’t in love with a specific breed, consider adopting a dog. Most of the dogs in animal rescue shelters are hybrids, or ""mutts."" Getting a dog from a shelter will allow you to help your community by taking responsibility for an unwanted or stray dog.


Personnel at the rescue/humane society will usually be able to tell you about the temperaments and behaviors of individual dogs in their care. Even without breed characteristics, you should be able to get a good sense of a dog’s personality.

, The final factor to consider before looking for a dog is whether you want a puppy, an adult dog, or an elderly dog. There are various benefits and downsides to each.


Puppies are adorable, and can grow together with children to form memories and long-lasting friendships. They're also a lot of work at first, and require careful training to make sure they're safe to have around the house when they grow up. You'll have to deal with accidents and high energy, just like with any other baby.
An adult dog may be difficult to break of old bad habits, but they can also come pre-house trained! They are also calmer than puppies, and won't require as much supervision.
Elderly dogs will likely have health problems, but they can make wonderful, loving companions for elderly people or those with a sedentary lifestyle. These dogs are least likely to be adopted, so giving a home to an elderly dog would be a great service to an animal in need.

, After you have done your research, you will want to meet with the dog you are considering adopting. Set up an appointment with the breeder or shelter to get to know all of the dogs you're considering. Try to gauge each dog’s personality by playing with it, walking with it, and handling it. To increase your understanding of its personality, spend as much time with the dog as possible. Don't adopt a dog that doesn't feel like a good fit. Be patient and keep looking — you'll find the right dog for you!

, In most states, puppies must be at least 8 weeks old before they can be sold or adopted, though some allow adoptions at 7 weeks.If a breeder or shelter is offering a puppy below 7 or 8 weeks, they are likely not a reputable source for a pet, and should be avoided. If adopting from a shelter, make sure the staff have performed a temperament evaluation before offering a dog for adoption.

, Breeders and shelter attendants spend a lot of time with the animals in their care. They'll be able to tell you about the individual dog’s personality and behavior. Ask if the dog is friendly or tolerates smaller dog, cats, or other animals. Take what you learn from the dog's caretakers and combine it with your observations of the dog: does it play well, or is it aggressive toward other dogs?

, You may be tempted to stop and interact with the dogs at first, but make yourself observe the dogs from a distance and take notes on which ones stand out to you. On your second pass, visit with the dogs that seemed like good fits on your first pass.


Put your hand up to the cage and see how the dog reacts. It should be eager to approach you and sniff your hand.
Move your hand slowly back and forth. If the dog does not follow your hand, it may not be well-socialized.
Avoid dogs that bark in your face, jump, or lunge at you.

, If you live with others — even a significant other who visits a lot — you need to make sure the dog responds well to everyone it will come into contact with. When visiting the dog, bring along other members of the household and see how they interact with it. Does anyone seem turned off by the dog’s personality? Afraid of it? All members of your little “pack” should be excited about the prospect of living together.

, Remember that a dog might be with you for 15 years or more — don’t assume that all dogs will simply be able to adjust to the introduction of a child. If you don’t have children, ask a friend to bring their children along with you when you visit.


Note that responsible dog-ownership means teaching children how to interact safely with dogs. It’s your job to prevent children from pulling on tails and ears or getting too close to a dog’s mouth.
However, notice if the dog is overwhelmed by a child’s loud noises or rapid movements. If not overwhelmed, a dog’s instincts might still be triggered in an unwanted way. For example, herding breeds sometimes nip at running children’s heels, frightening them if not injuring them., If you are getting a dog from a breeder, they may actually own the parents and allow you to meet them. Most breeders will understand and accommodate such a request. Interacting with the parents will give you a way to gauge what your dog will act like as it grows up because dogs often inherit their parents' personality traits., If you are unsure about whether a dog is right for you, ask to set up a temporary housing situation. This may be easier if you are adopting from a shelter than if you're buying from a breeder. A shelter may allow you to foster a dog, or even several dogs over a long period of time. This will give you time to get to know your potential pet and figure out if it's a good fit for your home, family, and lifestyle.You should also choose a shelter with a reasonable return policy, in case you cannot keep the dog you adopt.
Do not expect to get your adoption fee back if you return the dog, but the shelter should not refuse returns outright. Refusing to accept returned dogs suggests a shelter doesn't care enough about the lives of their animals.

Meet the dog.,
Bring your new dog home.",How to Choose a Dog That's Easy to Train2," Before you decide to buy a dog from a breeder, you should consider adopting from a local animal shelter. Adoption costs less than purchasing a puppy, and there are lots of dogs in your area that are in need of homes. Visit several shelters in person and online to see if you can find a dog that is easy to train., If you are set on adopting a specific breed of dog, try contacting a breed specific rescue group or network. For example, the American Kennel Club has more than 450 rescue network groups across the United States that assist people in finding the perfect rescue dog., If you have explored local shelters and breed specific rescue groups, but still cannot find the right dog for you, locate a responsible dog breeder. Get referrals from others who bought puppies from the breeder, check the breeder’s credentials, and visit the breeder’s facilities in person before making a commitment to purchase a puppy.

, Talk to the shelter staff or breeder about a specific dog’s trainability. These professionals can be a wealth of information regarding the dog’s history and behavior. Make sure you ask about what commands the dog currently knows and what troubles it might have had thus far with training. If possible, ask the breeder about how easily a puppy’s parents picked up on training.

, Once you’ve located a dog that seems to be a good fit, take a trip to meet the dog. Be sure you involve all members of your family in this process. It is especially important that you also involve canine members of the family to ensure your new addition will get along well with the pack. Spend at least an hour with the new dog, take it on a walk, and engage in play before making a commitment to bring it home.


Try some simple commands during your visit, like sit or stay.

, Once you’ve chosen a dog, introduced it to all members of your family, and finalized paperwork, it will be time to bring home your new dog. Make sure you are prepared with a collar, leash, bed or crate, toys, food, treats, and bowls for food and water. You should also be sure to have established house rules in advance so you can begin your training at once."

Take your Collie to the vet for regular check-ups.",How to Groom Your Collie," While it may seem like you need to attend to their long fur more often, once a week should be sufficient for most Collies. You may want to brush them twice or more week during their shedding season, which typically takes place once a year during mid to late summer.Start by finely misting your Collie’s coat with water using a spray bottle to keep their hair supple. Use a pin or slicker brush to comb their fur with the grain (that is, from their neck towards their tail).
Be sure to gently remove any tangles as you go. Keep brushing until you can work the brush easily through their hair without feeling any resistance.
For stubborn mats, use a comb to pick them out. If they still don’t budge, trim them using a blunt-nosed grooming scissors. Place your middle and forefinger on either side of the hair just under the mat and against your Collie’s skin to put a barrier between them and the scissors. Then, clip away the mat, leaving as much of their fur as you can.;
, Rough collies tend to grow long tufts of hair around their ears and on the back sides of their legs. These sensitive areas are especially prone to matting, so it’s wise to give them extra attention during your dog’s weekly brushing.Hold down each ear in turn while gently combing the hair behind it back, away from the ear. If you encounter any tangles, hold the hair below them while you use a comb to pick them out.
Be sure to brush out the fringes of fur behind their front legs and in their armpits along the grain of the hair. Do the same for their “pants,” the ruff of hair at the back of their hind legs.

, Use a damp cloth or flannel to wipe down your Collie’s coat after brushing. Follow the grain of their fur, moving from their neck to tail. Apply enough pressure to pick up any lingering hair or dirt, but avoid rubbing since that can press debris into their coat or skin instead of removing it., Collies don’t usually have a “doggy” smell, and frequent bathing or exposure to human bath products can dry out or irritate their skin while depleting the natural oils in their coats. Give them a bath only when necessary or a few times a year unless otherwise directed by a vet.Bathe them in a tub, shower, or outside using a hose with a gentle spray nozzle. It will be easiest to do if they’re in an enclosed space with a mobile water source (like a detachable shower head).Wet your dog’s coat from the neck down using luke-warm water. Lather their fur from their neck down with a mild, hypoallergenic, fragrance-free dog shampoo. Rinse away the suds with luke-warm water until the water runs clear.Once you’ve given your Collie a thorough rinse, let them shake the water out of their coat. Then, use a large, absorbent towel to gently pat them dry.If your Collie is often dirty from outings, rinse away the mud with plain water rather than bathing them more often.

, You can use a blunt-nosed grooming scissors and/or an electric hair trimmer. The scissors will help you trim hair more precisely, but the electric trimmer can be quicker and safer. If your Collie is skittish when it comes to grooming, use the latter., Long-coated Rough Collies will often get tufts of hair around their perky ears. Keep them in check by clipping away any excess fur with your grooming shears or trimmer.Start by pressing your Collie’s ear forward against their skull to expose any surrounding tufts behind or on either side of their ear. Cut the hair immediately surrounding their earn down to about an inch in length.
You can also trim any long hairs growing out of the ear themselves. Clip them close to your Collie’s ear, being careful to avoid snipping their actual ear.

, Any long hair around your Collie’s foot pads is liable to become easily matted or caked with mud and dirt. To ensure your pet’s comfort, keep the fur around their feet, on top of their toes, and between their pads very short. Use a small, blunt-nosed scissors or an electric hair trimmer to remove excess paw hair., Rough Collies may have a profusion of hair growing on the back sides of their hind legs. If that’s the case, comb it straight out away from their legs with your slick brush, and trim it using your scissors.Clip it evenly, following the line of your dog’s leg. You can trim it down to be short enough to match the hair on the front of their hind legs.

, The fur on a Collie’s tail often grows wild and can accumulate a lot of dirt. Stick to trimming away just the fly-away hairs or uneven fur that’s sticking out. Trimming down all the fur on their tail would look odd and patchy., While you want to trim away mats and excess fur in sensitive areas that are prone to matting, it’s not a good idea to shave or significantly trim your dog’s fur in general. Collie’s double-coats may seem like a burden in warmer weather, but they actually help regulate their body temperature year-round. Their fur insulates in the winter and cools them down in the summer., For major trims, it’s wise to call in a professional. Taking your pet to a groomer every three months or so will help make the regular maintenance of their thick double-coats a whole lot easier., Regular clipping will keep your Collie’s claws from cracking, breaking, or scratching. To do so, you will need a scissor-like Miller’s Forge trimmer designed for medium-sized dogs as well as some styptic powder to address any bleeding. Frequently, the powder will come packaged with the clippers.Going one paw at a time, firmly hold each foot around the ankle with your less dominant hand while using your dominant hand to operate the clippers.Before trimming, look for the tiny red nerve ending called the “quick” on the underside of each claw. Only clip the bit of the nail that extends beyond the quick, always erring on the side of leaving too much.If you accidentally clip through the quick or see blood, press styptic powder firmly into the end of their nail to staunch the bleeding. Give your dog lots of praise and treats to reassure them that everything’s alright.If your Collie is not a fan of this process, recruit another person to hold them in place and comfort them while you clip their nails. If they still don’t stop squirming, it’s probably best to leave this task to a professional., Keep your Collie’s perky ears free from wax and dirt by cleaning them with a mild canine ear cleaner. Start by checking for any signs of infection like swelling, bad smells, rashes, or discharge. If you notice any of these symptoms, take your dog to the vet instead of proceeding with the cleaning.To clean your Collie’s ears, drip a small amount of the cleaning solution into each ear. It should be just enough to fill each ear canal. Massage the base of your dog’s ear for 10-20 seconds; then, let them shake their head to get the cleaner out.Use a clean cotton ball to gently wipe away any liquid, dirt, and wax that was released by the cleaning solution. To avoid damaging to your Collie’s inner ear, don’t use cotton swabs or poke into their ear canal., Good oral hygiene is essential to warding off bad breath, tartar buildup, and bacterial infections. Brushing your Collie’s teeth is the easiest way to promote their oral hygiene. To maximize convenience and effectiveness, get an angled toothbrush and toothpaste made especially for medium-sized dogs.Dog toothpaste comes in a variety of meaty flavors that your Collie will enjoy and doesn’t need to be rinsed out of their mouths. Human toothpaste can be poisonous or harmful to dogs, especially those with fluoride and/or baking soda.
Pull up your Collie’s lips, and brush their teeth along the gumline with quick, gentle circular motions. You only need to brush the front-side of their teeth.You can also minimize plaque buildup by feeding your dog dry kibble and providing them with dental chews.

, As you groom, be on the lookout for any potential symptoms of infections like sores, rashes, redness, discoloration, swelling, scabs, and/or discharge. These could be indications of allergies, skin conditions, or systemic issues that can negatively impact your Collie’s health. If you see any worrying symptoms, make an appointment with a vet seek a diagnosis and appropriate treatment., Be sure that your pet is well cared for, inside and out. Register your Collie with a local veterinary practice, and make regular visits so that you can catch any health issues early. Besides reminding you to schedule annual health exams for your Collie, your vet will help you ensure that your pooch is up-to-date with vaccinations and parasite control treatments.Up until age 7, Collies should go in for at least one check-up a year. After that, it’s best to schedule one every six months.

Test your dog’s eyesight.,
Check your dog’s pupils.,
Compare eye size.,
Look for other eye abnormalities.",How to Diagnose Collie Eye in Shelties1," If you want to know if your Sheltie has CEA, then test his eyesight. In mild cases, your dog may be able to see well enough to cope. In severe cases, your dog may be blind.Place objects in your dog’s path and see if he avoids them or bumps into the obstruction.
Take your dog on a walk along an unfamiliar route. See if he runs ahead to explore or walks hesitantly by your side as if unsure of his footing.
Wag your finger toward your dog’s eyeball and see if he blinks reflexively. Be careful that you don't create an air current when doing this or the dog may sense the air movement on his whiskers and blink because of that.;
, Watch the size of your dog's pupils and see if they become small in bright light. If the pupils remain large in bright sunshine, then there is likely a problem with the eye., Carefully compare the size of one of the eye globes with the other. It's not common, but sometimes CEA can affect the size of the globe and result in a smaller than usual eye., In rare cases, some other symptoms may present. Other symptoms that may arise are eyes that are sunken in the sockets or a cloudy film over the eyes."
"
Consider your lifestyle.,
Think about your living space.,
Take age into consideration.",How to Choose a Dog That's Easy to Train3," When you decide to adopt a dog, you should take your lifestyle into account. A dog, no matter how easy they are to train, will need your time, affection, and dedication. Think about how much time you will have to spend training, exercising, and caring for a dog before you decide to make a lifelong commitment to the animal., You should take your living space into account when you decide to become a dog owner. Consider how large your home is, as well as what types of exercise-friendly spaces your new dog will be able to access. For example, a large breed might not be a great choice if you live in a small apartment and don't have access to a yard - you'll have a harder time training them. If you choose an active breed, you will need to make sure the dog will have access to a yard, dog park, or trails on a daily basis.

, When you choose a dog, you should think about how its age will affect both your lifestyle and its potential for training. In some cases, it can be easier to mold the behaviors and personality of a puppy or adolescent dog. While age doesn’t determine how trainable a dog is, some older dogs might already know certain commands, making training easier.

"
"
Think about the time and space you have available.,
Consider getting a highly trainable, active breed.,
Think about getting a more laid back breed.,
Go with a dog that’s at least one year old.",How to Choose a Dog for Older Kids1," Consider how much time you and your child have for walking, brushing and grooming, training, and playing. If you want to keep grooming low maintenance, consider a shorthaired dog that’s recommended for families, like a Boxer.If you don’t have the space in your home and yard for a larger breed, consider apartment dogs, like Italian Greyhounds and Chihuahuas. Keep in mind that, while fine for older kids, smaller breeds are fragile and aren’t recommended for younger children.;
, Working and herding dogs like Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, German Shepherds, and Collies are well-known as great family dogs. These breeds can help you teach your older child the value of training and have the energy to play with an active preteen or teen. They’ve been bred to be social and to work alongside humans, and are better for families since they are less likely to attach to just one person.In addition to being naturally social, they instinctively take commands and are eager to please their owners and family.
Be sure you have the time and space for an active working or herding breed or mix of these breeds.

, If you and your child don’t have the time to maintain the activity level of highly active dog, consider a more mellow larger breed, like a Newfoundland, Mastiff, or a hound. They are loyal and reliable companions, and their laid back dispositions might work better if your family’s schedule is already packed.If you don’t have the space requirements for a larger mellow breed, consider a lapdog, like a Yorkshire Terrier. If you have another youngster in your household, remember that experts recommend against getting a small dog if you have young children.

, Trainers and vets generally recommend dogs for families that are already house-trained and socialized. Puppies require lots of training and supervision that might take more time than you have on hand, especially if your older kid is busy with school, sports, and other extracurricular activities.If you get a dog over a year old from a breeder or shelter, be sure to ask, “Has this dog interacted with people, and to what degree has it been socialized? Has it ever had previous owners, and has it ever been around kids?”
If you go with an older dog, look for one that lived in a household with kids or at least people other than a single owner. Look for dogs with gentle dispositions, that don’t bark too excessively, and that demonstrate trainability."

Take your sheltie to a veterinary ophthalmologist.,
Get an eye exam.,
Examine the optic nerve.,
Know that the CEA gene cannot be detected by diagnosis.",How to Diagnose Collie Eye in Shelties2," CEA is present at birth. The ideal time for a veterinary ophthalmologist to examine the eye is around five to eight weeks of age. This catches the pup in a sweet spot where the eye is big enough to examine, but before retinal pigments develop which can obscure the signs the specialist is looking for.Most adoptions occur after eight weeks of age. Talk to the breeder to see if the sheltie has been checked for CEA. If he hasn’t, take him to the vet.

, When you take your dog to the veterinary ophthalmologist, the specialist examines the pup in a dark room. She will use a tool called an ophthalmoscope, which is part lens and part light source. She will shine the ophthalmoscope on the back of the eye and look for patches that are unusually transparent and through which the blood vessels are easily seen. This indicates the presence of CEA., The specialist will also examine the area around the optic nerve to see if the blood vessels suddenly disappear over the edge of a coloboma. She will also check to see if the retina is attached properly, or floating detached from the choroid., Unfortunately, an optical exam does not help detect dogs that carry the CEA gene who are not affected themselves. However, a genetic test is now available to detect the gene.A blood sample is sent to a specialist lab where it is screened for the mutation.
Ideally all Shelties should be genetically screened prior to breeding, and only dogs that are completely healthy used as breeding stock.

"
Know there is no treatment.,
Know where most cases occur.,
Be aware of related problems.",How to Diagnose Collie Eye in Shelties3," If your dog is diagnosed CEA, the condition shouldn’t worsen. Most dogs live long, healthy lives with little eyesight problems. Unfortunately, there is no treatment or cure for CEA.Awareness of the condition is crucial. Affected dogs should not be bred since the genetic mutation can be passed down to the offspring.

, In Shelties, the numbers affected by CEA are considerably higher in Europe than in the United States. The incidence in the US is thought to be around 0.39%, which means around four dogs in every 1000 are affected., CEA can be associated with other problems, like a coloboma, which is like a crater that forms around the optic nerve. Sometimes, the retina separates completely from the choroid and the dead space can fill with blood.If your dog has a coloboma, your dog can get surgery to help with that.Surgery may also be suggested if there is a threat of retinal detachment.

Buy the right tools.,
Choose a grooming spot.,
Get your puppy used to brushing.,
Brush specific areas carefully.,
Look for mats and knots.",How to Groom a Rough Collie1," Caring for a Rough Collie’s thick double coat can be challenging, but it is manageable with the right tools. While there are a variety of products and specialized tools on the market, you can properly groom your pet with a few basic items. Visit a pet store to buy:A bristle brush
A long pin brush
A basic comb
Grooming scissors
A matt splitter;
, Pick a consistent spot to groom your pet that will be relatively distraction-free and comfortable. Opt for an easy to clean surface (e.g. the floor, a tabletop, a mat specifically reserved for grooming) that hair will not stick to. A raised surface will limit your dog’s movement and require less effort for you, but be sure that you will be able to lift a fully-grown dog onto it down the line., Starting to brush your puppy early (at around eight weeks old) will allow it to relax and cooperate in the future. Gently restrain the puppy with one hand and start brushing it very lightly with the pin brush to get it used to the process. Have your puppy sit or stand for brushing, either on the floor or on a raised surface like a table, and praise it for staying still., Brushing sessions for a full-grown collie should last about 30 minutes and cover different areas with specific tools and care. This regular brushing ensures that the coat and skin of your dog stay in top condition, and that its undercoat doesn’t get matted.Certain areas of your dog’s coat require special attention and sensitivity, such as:The front legs: the back of your dog’s front legs should be brushed with a pin brush, then with a comb to smooth hair
The fluffy hair on the back legs should be brushed very carefully with a pin brush
The hair on its tail should be brushed very lightly with a pin brush, as it is very sensitive
Hair on the dog’s underside, where your dog may not enjoy being brushed. Use a pin brush, brush gently, and have someone help you keep the dog still if it gets restless
All other areas should be brushed thoroughly with a pin brush, then with a bristle brush to ensure that the undercoat is as smooth as possible

, As your dog’s hair grows longer, it is important to look for mats in its coat while brushing. Mats occur in areas on the coat where there is rubbing or movement, or where old hair gets caught up with new, growing hair. Mats can be teased out with a comb to prevent them from becoming knots, which generally must be removed by gently dragging the mat splitter across the hair to cut the knot out. The key areas on your Rough Collie to look for mats are:The front legs, particularly near the top where the leg joint joins the body
The hind legs, especially at the bottom where grass and twigs might get caught
The rear, particularly near the base of the tail
The tail

Adjust your senior border collie’s diet.,
Consider your dog’s health issues.",How to Choose Food for your Border Collie1," Your border collie will need a wholesome, high-protein nutritional diet that is appropriate for its activity level. Border collies are working dogs, and they typically have higher nutritional needs than other breeds. However, each border collie has a different activity level and receives various degrees of exercise.You should always consulate your veterinarian when determining the best options for your border collie based on its activity level.


Your border collie will need more fat, protein, and calories if it is extremely active. If your dog often runs continuously for a 30-minute period, herds sheep, or participates in competitions, it may be considered a highly active dog.An athletic border collie’s food should contain 25% protein and 15% fat.Your active, working dog’s daily calorie intake should be around 1400 calories.A less active border collie should receive a maintenance diet, or a sufficient amount of nutrients and calories to support their moderate activity level.A maintenance diet requires a minimum of 18% protein and 5% fat.Your dog's calorie intake should be around 996 calories per day.Be cautious about feeding your border collie based on the number of cups, because the calorific content varies greatly between different foods. Instead, feed the amount recommended on the pack and then check your dog's body condition once a week. If the ribs become more difficult to feel, then reduce amount fed by 5 to 10%. If the dog's ribs have become obvious, then increase the ration by a similar amount.;
, A playful, growing puppy needs a lot of nutrients and nourishment to support healthy growth. On average, puppies need a diet that consists of 25 to 30% protein. Refer to the recommended serving size based on the puppy’s weight, which will be listed on your dog’s food package.Be careful not to overfed your puppy. Medium-sized breeds like border collies can develop bone or joint issues if they eat too much when they are pups., As dogs age, they undergo metabolic and body composition changes which may require changes to their diet. Although some senior dogs are not as active, they still require adequate levels of quality protein to help maintain muscle mass. However, their caloric intake may need to decrease to ward off any weight gain. An active senior border collie will require a diet more consistent with the diet they had as adults.


Studies have indicated that the caloric requirements for a working border collie do not decline with age, provided that they remain active. As they age, their protein and fat intake should remain consistent.In some studies, border collies that are household pets displayed typical signs of aging and decreased energy levels.The activity level of an older dog declines as it ages and is more likely to rest, take naps, and go on shorter walks, and therefore does not need to burn as many calories throughout the day.A senior border collie should receive about 717 calories each day., Be sure to discuss your dog’s particular health problems with your veterinarian. The type of health issue may be alleviated by adjusting its diet. Your veterinarian will consider your dog’s daily intake of fiber, protein, fat, carbohydrate, and other nutrients and will adjust these depending on your dog’s symptoms or diagnosis.


A dog with kidney problems should be fed a diet that is moderate to high fat, contains a moderate amount of high-quality protein, and is low in carbohydrates.
A high-fiber diet is recommended for a dog that suffers from frequent constipation or anal gland disease.Border collies may suffer from orthopedic condition called osteochondrosis dissecans, which causes pain in the elbow and other joints. Feeding a border collie puppy too much ""growth formula"" puppy food or feeding an adult high-protein foods can contribute to this condition."

Select a dog breed.,
Talk to your local kennel club.,
Ask your vet for names.,
Go to a dog or trade show.,
Search online for breeder information.,
Consider adoption.",How to Choose a Dog Breeder1," A good breeder will specialize in 1-2 specific breeds so it is important that you choose your type of dog first. Consider your lifestyle and personal preferences. Some areas to think about: activity level, friendliness with others pets or children; trainability; size or final weight; grooming requirements; coat length and type; age; sex., If you are looking for a pure breed dog your best resources is the American Kennel Club (AKC) and its local chapters. Go to the AKC website to find your local chapter. This group will then put you into contact with a breeder referral expert who can help with your search. You can also see what information your local AKC has posted on their website as well., Your vet is always a good resources for anything pet related. Call or make an appointment with them to discuss what kind of dog you’d like and where best to find them. Vets often have a great deal of insight regarding those bad breeders whose animals require lots of care or receive no care at all.You might ask, “Do you know of any excellent local Pomeranian breeders? Tell me about how you know them.”

, If you are looking for a dog with a particular skill set, such as hunting, you may be best served by going to a gathering focusing on that particular area. Agricultural shows often showcase dogs for sale and, if not, you can simply ask about the origins of a dog that seems like a good fit for you., You can use the internet to both expand and dig up additional insights into your current list of possible breeders. Type in the breeder names to see what pops up in the search screen. Eliminate any breeders that have ever been investigated. You can also type in your name and city to find additional breeder options. Or, use the digital AKC Marketplace Puppy Finder by going to their website and entering your breed request, preferred gender, and zipcode.Make sure to carefully read any breeder reviews that you find. Look for red flags such as comments about poor animal treatment or litigation. You can also check with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) to see if any claims have been filed.

, You should always seriously investigate adopting your dog, even if you are looking for a purebred. Roughly 25% of dogs in animal shelters can be identified as purebred making them a great option for many people. Mixed breeds dogs also offer their own benefits of increased healthfulness as well. By working with a shelter or rescue you can also get access to a puppy as well, if that is your desire.Find a list of local shelters or rescue organizations by entering your city name and “animal shelter” or “animal rescue” into a search engine. You will also find that adoption is generally a much cheaper option.
If you are concerned about AKC papers, you can contact the AKC to discuss processes that are in place to welcome adopted dogs into the fold and allow them to participate in AKC dog competitions alongside breeder animals.

Think about how ready your child is for a new dog.,
Make sure your child understands their responsibilities.,
Consider health, hygiene, and allergies.,
Consider fostering a dog before adopting it.,
Try dogsitting for friends and family.",How to Choose a Dog for Older Kids2," Choosing the kind of dog you get will depend on how much care you and your child can offer. Further, just because you have an older kid doesn’t mean they’re developmentally ready to help care for an animal. Consider how reliably they handle other responsibilities, like chores and homework.Have a talk with your child about what having a pet like a dog entails. Say, “Having a dog involves a lot more than playing.” Measure their awareness of those responsibilities by asking them, “What are some of the things you need to do in order to properly care for a dog?”
Think about how they’ve interacted with animals in the past. Did your family have another dog in the past? Did your child have a fish or hamster growing up, and if so, how well did they care for their pets in the past?

, Clearly define your expectations in addition to establishing the general responsibilities that dog ownership entails. Tell your child exactly how you expect them to be involved in caring for your potential new dog.Try saying, “If we choose an active dog, remember that it will need lots of exercise. We can both take it for walks: I’ll take it out in the morning, but you’ll have to walk it every evening.”
Before choosing a dog, think about your schedules, and make sure you both have the time to dedicate to a new animal. Whether you get an active breed or a lapdog, your new pet will need lots of time and energy. Make sure both you and your child know what each of your responsibilities will be.

, While it’s typically less of an issue in older kids, make sure your child knows when to wash their hands and practice good hygiene after playing with an animal. If your family has a history of allergies or eczema, consider getting allergy tests to rule out any dog allergies.If allergies are an issue, consider a dog with less dander that sheds less. Examples include the Bichon Frise, Portuguese Water Dog, Maltese, and Poodle.When you acquire your new dog, get it from a reputable breeder or shelter, and get a health exam as soon as possible in order to avoid any communicable diseases.

, Fostering can introduce you and your family to a breed, mix of breeds, or a specific dog, giving you a better idea of what will work best for your lifestyle. It will also give your child concrete examples of the responsibilities of dog ownership.Look for local shelters and call them to ask about their fostering policies. Find your local shelters by entering your zip code into the search tool on Shelter Pet Project: http://theshelterpetproject.org/.

, If you have any friends or family who own dogs, ask them if you could watch their pooch for a weekend. Think about people you know with different types of dogs. If you have the opportunity to take care of a German Shepherd one weekend and a Yorkie the next, you’ll be able to narrow down what size and activity level will best suit your child.

Ask your child about their preferences.,
Involve your child in selecting the dog’s necessities.,
Introduce your child and new dog.,
Start training your dog with your child.",How to Choose a Dog for Older Kids3," Be sure to involve your child in the selection process. Take their preferences, opinions, and suggestions into account as you both choose the right dog.


Ask them, “Which type of dog do you think you’d like best? Do you prefer any specific breeds? Would you rather get a purebred dog from a breeder or adopt from a shelter?”
Ask them about how much time and energy they have to care for a dog: “Will you be able to take the dog out before school, then go on a long walk after soccer practice? Since you’re pretty athletic, would you prefer to have a dog you can be active with over one that’s more of a lapdog?”

, Bring your child with you to the pet store in order to instill a sense of responsibility and to keep them involved in the ownership process. Have them help you select the dog’s leash, collar, and other necessities:Food and treats that are marked appropriate for your dog’s breed, age, and size. Consult with your dog’s vet about choosing an appropriate brand.
Food and water bowls.
Toys, including a ball or fetch toy and chew toys.
A bed and, if you choose to crate train your dog, a size-appropriate crate.

, If your child hasn’t gone with you to pick up the new dog, have them introduce themselves using “dog language.” Have them stand sideways, get into a low posture, and extend their hand with a closed fist for the dog to smell.After a successful scent introduction, have your child pet the dog on its back for a few moments.
If the dog doesn’t feel like meeting anyone new at that moment, don’t force any interactions.

, Have your child assist you teaching your dog commands, like sit, stay, and come. First, say the command clearly and firmly, then guide your dog into the appropriate position, and offer a treat as soon as the dog is in position. Repeat the sequence 10 to 20 times per training session.


Say to your child, “Watch me give the command and pay attention to the tone of voice I use. Always make sure you use commands consistently, and try to use the same tone of voice whenever you give the dog a command.”
In addition to commands, give your dog mental exercise by teaching it to fetch and play hide and seek with treats and toys.

Trim excess hair on the front and back paws.,
Remove overgrown hair on the ears.,
Pare down hair on the back legs.,
Cut away excess hair on pads.",How to Groom a Rough Collie2," Excess hair on your Rough Collie’s paws should be trimmed once a week so that they attract less dirt, debris, or mud. Gently brace your pet’s paw and brush its hair back in the direction opposite to how it grows. Using grooming scissors, trim overgrown hair., Gently hold your Rough Collie’s ear by the base with one hand and trim the excess hair growing from the top of it with the other hand. For a closer trim, gently pull hair away from the ear and trim as close as possible to its edge (a few millimeters away). Be very careful as the skin on the back of the ears is very thin and fragile., The hair on your Rough Collie’s back legs should be trimmed when overgrown for a more polished look. Have your dog lie on its side and hold its foot gently to brace the leg. Use grooming scissors to cut hair on its back leg into an arc shape., With your dog still lying on its side, grip its wrist gently but firmly between your thumb and index finger. With your free hand, cut hair growing underneath the paw until it is level with the pad of your dog’s foot. Trim all the way to the wrist."
"
Clean its ears.,
Clean its teeth.,
Trim your dog’s nails.",How to Groom a Rough Collie3," Once a week, check your Rough Collie’s ears for redness or signs of infection (e.g. discharge or odor). If you see waxiness or dirt inside of the ear, clean it carefully. Brace your dog’s ear gently and wipe the inside of it with a wet cotton cloth.Contact your veterinarian immediately if you see signs of infection.

, Gently pull back your dog’s lips to reveal its teeth. Remove any visible plaque or tartar with a dental scraper (available at pet stores) or with your fingernail. Gently brush your dog's teeth, or feed it a dental treat. If any signs of irritation or infection are evident (e.g. redness, swelling, or strong odor), bring your dog to the vet for a complete dental check up to rule out any serious issues.

, While many dog owners prefer to have their pet’s nails trimmed at the groomer’s, or by a veterinarian during a routine check up, it is possible to trim your dog’s nails on your own. With your dog laying on its side, brace its paw and look for the quick, a pink vein attached to the nail bed. Using dog clippers (available at pet stores), clip the nail as much as you can without hitting the vein. Pet and praise your dog throughout the process.If you do hit the vein, stop the bleeding by dabbing the nail into a bar of soap.

"
"
Give your dog a pre-bath brush.,
Shampoo the dog.,
Rinse out the shampoo.,
Dry your dog’s coat.",How to Groom a Rough Collie4," Rough Collies are naturally clean dogs and only require bathing every 6-8 weeks, less regularly than other breeds. Given the volume and length of hair that Rough Collies have, it is best to brush out mats and excess hair before bathing them to allow water to penetrate their coat more easily. Brush from your dog’s rear, upwards, against the grain of the hair.Be sure to bathe your dog during its molting period, which occurs about once a year for males and three times every two years for females.

, Place a towel or non-slip mat on the shower floor and have your Rough Collie stand on it. Wet its coat from its rear upwards, then apply dog shampoo (available at pet stores) and lather in the same direction. To make things easier, try brushing shampoo through your dog’s coat rather than lathering it with your fingers.Never use human shampoo on your dog- it is harsher than dog shampoo and will wash away the essential oils from your dog's coat, which can leave your dog vulnerable to bacteria and parasites., Thoroughly rinse out the shampoo from your dog’s hair. Given the Rough Collie’s thick double coat, devote extra time to rinsing to prevent soap build up that could cause skin irritations. Squeeze out as much excess water as you can., Once all the shampoo is rinsed out, take a step back and let your dog shake off before drying it. Using a large towel, pat your dog down to remove excess water. Use a blow dryer on a low setting to dry your dog’s coat completely.To avoid tangles, hold the blow dryer at a distance from your dog and blow dry slowly.

Select a dry dog food.,
Feed your border collie canned dog food.,
Read the label and look for quality ingredients.,
Look for an animal protein.,
Look for food that contains essential fatty acids.",How to Choose Food for your Border Collie2," Dry dog food provides an energy-dense meal and offers the required levels of protein, fat, and other nutrients to help fuel your border collie. Dry food is typically budget-friendly and is easier to store and serve, but it is more likely to have added grains than other dog food options.Talk to your veterinarian to see if dry dog food is the best option for your border collie.

, Canned food often contains more protein and more moisture than dry dog food, which can help ensure that your dog is well-hydrated.However, canned food often has higher levels of salt and sugar and can contribute to weight gain.Talk to your veterinarian before giving your border collie canned dog food, particularly if it has a weight problem or diabetes.

, When choosing a dog food, read through the list of ingredients printed on the label. Search for real, familiar, wholesome ingredients to ensure that your border collie is receiving a high-quality, optimal diet with minimal fillers and preservatives. By law, the ingredients are listed by weight, and an animal protein should be the first ingredient listed on the label.


Be mindful that some budget brands may meet the nutritional requirements, but these are met by using low-quality ingredients that are not easily digestible or beneficial.
If an ingredient listed on the label are not familiar to you, it is most likely a filler or a preservative. Fillers will move through your dog’s digestive system quickly and will not provide adequate nutrients or energy.

, Protein helps fuel the body and helps a dog maintain its muscle mass, which is what is needed for an active border collie. Animal proteins contain most of the vitamins and minerals a dog needs to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Animal proteins such as chicken, lamb, beef, fish, organ meat, and eggs provide the necessary amino acids that are vital for optimal health.When searching for a commercial dog food, be sure that the first ingredient is a meat protein to help fuel your energetic Border Collie.


Most dog food companies add plant proteins to dog food, including corn, wheat, and soy. These are difficult for a dog to digest., Fats play an important role in your dog’s diet. They provide your dog with energy and soluble nutrients. Fats also make food more appetizing and support a healthy coat.Most fats found in commercial dog foods include lard, tallow, poultry fat, and hydrogenated vegetable oils. Opt for the brand that provides animal fats rather than vegetable oils.


A border collie’s coat should be shiny and soft. If your dog’s coat is dull and dry, it may not be receiving enough fat. Talk to your veterinarian about supplementing your dog’s diet."

Pay attention to the contract.",How to Choose a Dog Breeder2," To make an initial contact, email is fine. If you don’t receive a response or if you’d like to talk to them directly, a phone call is then a good option. Be aware that you may have to call and leave message multiple times before hearing back. This is normal, especially with part-time breeders.If you leave a message simply give your name and phone number as well as your desire for a puppy of a certain breed. It also helps if you can state how you found out about this breeder.

, Either over the phone or through email conversations you must get more information about the breeder’s background. You can ask why they entered into this process. You can find out how long they’ve been in business in the same location. You can ask how many puppies they’ve successfully placed and how many ‘returns’ they’ve had and why., A good breeder should be an expert of all things related to the dogs that they breed. Request that the breeder tell you about the good and bad characteristics of your potential pet, as a group. Ask about the breed’s care requirements and any immediate suggestions that your breeder can offer. A good breeder will be happy to share their knowledge (and show off a bit!)A good breeder will not possess an encyclopedic knowledge of all dogs. Instead, they will focus solely on 1-2 specific breeds and that is it. Be very wary of breeders who promise that they can get you any type of dog that you want., A good breeder will only sell puppies that they’ve bred and raised personally or in-house. These means that they may not always have puppies instantly available to sell and that is a good thing. In fact, it is generally better to find a breeder with a bit of a wait list as it shows that they are in demand.You can ask a breeder how many litters they raise per year in order to get an idea as to the scope of their operation. This is a good way to avoid “puppy mill” operations. A good breeder should just raise 1-2 litters a year to give enough time for care and proper placement., Most breeders will not let you take your puppy home until it is somewhere between 8-12 weeks old. This allows it to play and socialize with its littermates and mom, creating much happier, healthier dog in the end. A breeder should inform you of this timeline and provide information as to the number and overall health of litter., Most purebred dogs will come with some type of health documentation attesting to the dog’s overall genetic well-being. Look for documentation from stand-alone groups, such as the Canine Eye Registration Foundation. This will show that the dog’s relatives were tested and cleared.Do some research on your own to find out what specific health documentation you should request. Certain breeds are prone to particular genetic issues. German Shepherds, for example, are genetically predisposed for hip dysplasia and can be tested by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals.Also, be aware that a good breeder will wait until a dog pair is 2-3 years of age before attempting breeding. This is because some genetic conditions wait a few years before manifesting.

, Your breeder should be able to have a clear conversation regarding their general approach regarding breeding and care. You want a breeder that lives closely with their animals, as opposed to boarding them in a distant garage. You want a breeder that emphasizes socialization and frequent handling of the puppies.You also want a breeder that is passionate about purity and a particular breed. Don’t give your business to breeders who promise the unusual or bizarre. Breeding to get extreme sizes, for example, can lead to dogs with a variety of serious health problems., A good breeder wants their dogs in the best possible homes. They, therefore, will often make you sign a contract promising to return the dog (at any stage of life) if you no longer want it for whatever reason. They will also be willing to refund your money if your dog manifests a genetic illness as an adult or gets sick as a young puppy., A breeder should be able to provide you with tons of personal references. They can give you the names of other people who’ve purchased from them recently and in the distant past. They can put you in contact with local vets who can provide records of treatment of care. The best breeders also have other breeders who will provide references for them., Good breeders will ask you a wide variety of questions before even placing you on a waitlist for a future puppy. They will want you to explain your motivation for owning a dog. They will also ask about your daily care plans for the puppy and the composition of your household. Be as forthcoming as you can with all information as it will lead to a better experience overall.Similar to some rescue organizations, a good breeder might also request documentation from your landlord (if you are a renter) stating that you can own a pet of this breed.

, The breeder will provide you with a contract that specifies what each party owes the other. Make sure that you get this contract well in advance and that you carefully read it, noting any questions that you may have. The contract will contain details regarding payment, delivery of the puppy, care of the puppy, health guarantees, among other information.Your contract may also contain a clause specifying your agreement to have the puppy spayed or neutered. This is a good sign of a breeder trying to avoid pet overpopulation."

Make note of the condition of the animals.,
Meet your puppy’s parents.,
Interact with the puppy.",How to Choose a Dog Breeder3," Don’t limit your breeder search to only local facilities. You should expect to travel a bit to investigate facilities and look at potential puppies. Good breeders will allow you to visit at least once (often multiple times) with your family in tow. Anticipate these travel costs when you consider purchasing a purebred puppy.You can also use these visits as an opportunity for the breeder to teach your children about the correct treatment of puppies. Most breeders are more than happy to help children understand the basics of puppy ownership., Make sure to inspect the entire breeding facility in person. Walk around the grounds by yourself or with an escort. Check to see if the dogs have plenty of room for exercise and general comfort. Look to see if they are protected from the weather. Don’t forget to look at the indoor boarding areas as well., A little dirt here and there is normal, but you are looking for overall sanitary conditions. Pay particular attention to the food and water areas. Do the bowls look clean and fresh? Locate the toilet area. Are the feces picked up or just left to rot? The kennel area, in general, should be odor free., Check to see that the dog’s appear clean and lively. Their faces should be free of sores or mucus. No runny eyes or noses. The puppies, in particular, should be a bit plump. Protruding ribs can be a sign of malnutrition or disease.Pay attention to the mental needs of the animals as well. Do they have opportunities to socialize? Do you see toys present? Do they have an area in which to exercise?Watch how the dogs respond and react to the breeder. Are they excited or do they seem wary? This can give you an idea about how they are treated when visitors are not around.

, You should, at a minimum, spend some quality time with the puppy’s mother (also called a dam). Observe the mom’s behavior to see how your future puppy might behave. See if she is friendly and well-socialized. If you get a chance to interact with the father as well it is even better.Be aware that some breeders try to pass off any female dog as the dam. Look for enlarged mammary glands on the mother to get a bit more reassurance., Spend some time with the puppy in a group setting and alone. When your puppy is amongst its littermates, see how it treats the other puppies and how it is treated as well. You want a puppy that is neither a bully nor shy. Watch how your puppy reacts to interesting objects or smells. It should be inquisitive and curious, but a bit cautious too.Take a photo of your puppy for future reference. This will also help to ensure that you actually receive the final puppy that you’ve agreed upon.

Determine the difference between epilepsy and seizures.,
Take your dog to a veterinarian if it is having seizures.,

Follow your veterinarian's treatment regimen.",How to Diagnose Epilepsy in Beagles," Epilepsy often occurs at a young age, typically beginning around 6 months to 5 years of age. Seizures or fits then occur for the rest of the dog's life.Dogs can have different types of seizures associated with their epilepsy. These include:Focal seizures: These are associated with bizarre behavior, such as repeatedly and compulsively rubbing of one part of the body or 'fly-catching' behavior, where the dog snaps at invisible objects in the air. This type of seizure is also known as a complex partial seizure or psychomotor seizure.
Generalized seizures: This type of seizure affects the whole body. The dog is unconscious and unaware of what's happening to it or around it. The dog is unable to stand and usually collapses to one side. The body goes rigid, the limbs often move in a paddling motion, and the mouth may close tightly. Typically this lasts for 30 seconds to 3 minutes, after which time the dog recovers and regains consciousness.
Status epilepticus: This is where the dog enters a seizure but does not wake up. The seizure continues indefinitely or consists of several seizures but the dog does not regain consciousness between them. It is essential to seek veterinary attention if your dog is having this type of seizure, as brain damage can occur during status epilepticus.;
, Dogs with epilepsy are prone to groups of seizures spaced apart. Seizures often occur in cluster or groups, within a 24 hours period. How frequent these groups are depends on the individual. For example a dog with mild epilepsy may have one seizure every six months, while a severely affected individual may have groups of seizures every couple of weeks.After the first seizure contact your vet, who can medicate your pet to make another seizure the same day less likely.

, Abnormal electrical behavior in the brain can cause your beagle to behave strangely before, during, and after a seizure. This is yet another sign that your dog may have had a seizure. This behavior can include being aggressive and attempting to bite, in a dog that is otherwise sweet-tempered. Be aware of this and be extremely careful about allowing children close to the dog, as a child may accidentally get bitten.

, As an owner, your first step is to recognize your dog is having seizures and take the dog to the vet. However, it is important to keep a diary of how many and how often your dog's seizures are. This helps the vet determine the seriousness of the condition and the amount of medication that might be needed.

, The terms ""seizure"" and ""fits"" are often used interchangeably with ""epilepsy,"" but there is an important difference between them. Epilepsy is a medical condition, whereas a seizure is a symptom.This is equivalent to pneumonia being a medical condition, but a cough being the symptom. Seizures can be triggered by a variety of different things, such as ingesting a toxins, kidney disease, a porto-systemic shunt, brain cancer, meningitis, or other such medical or physical conditions.

, Seizures can signal a variety of illnesses, so it's important to have the dog assessed by a veterinarian to find the root cause. Unfortunately, there is no single test that gives an answer as to whether the dog's seizures are epileptic.

, To diagnose epilepsy, the vet rules out all conditions that can cause seizure.The condition of epilepsy is described as uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain for which no explanation can be found. This makes epilepsy a ""diagnosis of exclusion,"" meaning that it is only diagnosed when all other causes for seizure activity have been ruled out.This means that you will need to allow the vet to run a lot of tests if necessary.


The vet starts with a medical history, in order to rule out possible exposure to toxins which could cause seizures. If this proves negative, then screening blood tests are next on the list. These assess organ function, in an attempt to determine whether the liver, kidneys, and other organs are functioning normally. Blood test can also show if there could be a problem that causes natural toxins to build up and trigger seizures.
Based on these results, the vet may pursue clues. For example, if the blood creatinine levels are low, the vet may want to run additional liver function tests to rule out a portosystemic shunt.
The vet may want to check blood thyroid levels (low thyroid hormone can trigger seizures) and look at blood electrolyte levels to check for abnormalities due to disease which could cause seizures.If the vet is worried about infection, such as meningitis, causing seizures, he or she may collect a sample of spinal or brain fluid and analyze them.If all the tests come back normal or negative, the final test is to image the brain and run either an MRI or a CT scan. This provides a picture of the structure of the brain, and can rule out other conditions, such as a brain tumor or cysts on the brain.Only once all tests have come back normal can the vet definitively diagnose epilepsy.

, The treatment depends on the severity and frequency of the seizures. Anticonvulsant drugs are the mainstay of treatment, of which typically phenobarbital, potassium bromide, or imepitoin are prescribed. The vet may also prescribe suppositories of diazepam to give the beagle during a seizure. This will help to calm the brain waves and reduce the risk of another seizure occurring."

Allow your dog to go through the third stage of labor.,
Feed the dogs well.,
Monitor the mother in the weeks following birth.,
Observe the mother and pups.",How to Help Your Chihuahua During Labor," The average gestation period for a dog is between 58 and 68 days. Try to pinpoint when conception occurred so you can anticipate your dog's labor accordingly. Chihuahuas tend to deliver at 8 weeks gestation., If you are deliberately trying to breed your dog, take her to the veterinarian for a check-up beforehand. Re-visit the vet again about 30 days into the pregnancy.If the pregnancy wasn’t planned, however, take her to the vet as soon as you discover she’s pregnant.


The vet can give you critical information that will help you ensure your dog has a healthy pregnancy. One important thing to discuss is proper nutrition. Pregnant dogs that are overweight are more likely to have difficulties giving birth. However, pregnancy is not an ideal time to put chihuahuas on a diet, since the mother actually needs more calories in order to pass nutrients onto her litter. One recommendation is to delay putting your dog onto energy-dense, high-caloric foods (such as puppy food) until the final 2-3 weeks of pregnancy. At this point your dog will have a large womb and only want to snack anyway.Your vet can also count the number of puppies in the litter using x-rays. This happens at 45 days of pregnancy. Three to four puppies is normal for a typical chihuahua litter. Knowing how many puppies your dog is expecting can help you better prepare for the birth. If a very large or small number of puppies is expected, your dog may experience complications during labor. Your vet can recommend whether to pursue natural labor or a planned C-section. Further, knowing the number of puppies will also help you be certain when she is finished whelping (or giving birth). For example, if your dog is carrying four puppies, gives birth to three puppies, and then stops laboring, you will be able to identify that something is wrong and contact your vet., If a puppy has trouble nursing, you'll want to have formula on hand since newborn puppies need to be fed every 2-4 hours.


You can buy puppy formula and bottles at most pet supply stores. If you cannot find puppy formula, you can also use goat's milk, although this is not ideal for long-term use. Goat's milk should only be used in emergencies until you can buy some formula.

, To protect the mother and her puppies from contracting illnesses or diseases like canine herpes, keep her away from all other dogs in the 3 weeks leading up to her expected delivery date.It’s also highly advisable to keep the mother away from other dogs for three weeks following the delivery., About a week before your dog is due to begin labor, set up a whelping box in a quiet, private area. A whelping box (also commonly known as a nesting box or whelping pen) protects puppies during birth and early life by keeping them safely contained and protected.A whelping box can be as simple as a cardboard box. You can also purchase whelping boxes or build one yourself. There are many plans available online than range from simple boxes to more elaborate designs that can accommodate growing puppies.
Desirable features of a whelping box include ease of cleaning and sanitation, extensibility, and durability. Depending on your particular situation, you may also want the whelping box to be portable.
Make sure the sides of the box are easy for the mother to get in and out of, but sturdy enough that the newborn puppies cannot get out of the box.
For a quick alternative, a kiddy pool with bedding like clean old towels or blankets can act as an effective whelping box.
Set up the whelping box in a calm and quiet area away from other pets and household activities. Make this a cozy and warm space where she can go to give birth safely.

, You may notice that as your dog gets closer to full term, she exhibits nesting behavior and a tendency to withdraw or retreat. This is normal and is to be expected during the last few weeks of pregnancy. However, the opposite is also true; it's also normal for a pregnant dog to be clingy and want attention!

, There will be several signs to help you anticipate when labor is imminent; watch for them carefully so you can be prepared when it is time.


When your dog is close to giving birth, her teats will enlarge as her milk comes in. This can happen within a few days or as labor begins, so watch closely.
The vulva will get larger and more relaxed a few days before labor.
Most dogs will stop eating as labor begins. Vomiting and/or becoming 'picky' is also common.

, The dog’s temperature will drop a degree or so about 24 hours before labor. Get an idea of her normal temperature by measuring it every morning for the last week or two of pregnancy.


Lubricate a rectal thermometer and insert it about half an inch for three minutes to take your dog’s temperature. Her normal temperature will likely range between 101 and 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit.
When you notice a decrease of a degree or more, it’s a sign she will likely begin labor in 24 hours or less., This is when your dog's body prepares to give birth. Hormones are given off which relax the exit from the womb (the cervix). This is so that when true contractions start, the puppies can be expelled. These hormones also prime the muscles of the uterus with practice contractions. This practice phase helps prepare your dog for the more sustained contractions of the second stage of labor. Generally this first stage of labor lasts 24 hours. There is no immediate cause for concern if your dog starts acting oddly and nothing happens for a whole day.You may not be able to recognize that your dog is in the first stage of labor. She may withdraw or show signs of nesting, but these behaviors can also occur prior to the onset of labor.

, Your chihuahua may pant, whimper, move around as though uncomfortable, or hide. She may want to be with you or she may wish to be alone. Keep the lighting dim and the atmosphere relaxed and private.
The safer and less stressed the mother feels, the better she will be equipped to respond to the needs of her puppies.

, Once your dog is in active labor, she should not eat (nor will she likely want to). You should, however, be sure to offer water, though she may not want to drink it.

, When she has a contraction, it will be easy to identify–it will appear as a sort of wave across her belly. If you lay your hand on her belly, you will feel the uterus contract and tighten.


As she gets closer to delivering a puppy, you will notice her contractions become more frequent and/or pronounced. She may stand up, which is fine; don’t try to force her to lie down.

, This is the active ""pushing"" phase of labor, where your dog pushes the puppies out. This is characterized by the dog lying on her side and pushing with visible effort. You will likely see her holding her breath and the muscles of her flanks rippling and pressing down. She may grunt or groan as she presses, and generally give the impression that she is exerting herself.


It takes on average 30 minutes of hard labor for each puppy to be born. However, this varies greatly; some puppies are born just minutes apart, while others are born with an hour in between., The most likely complication is that a puppy will get stuck in the birth canal. Because a chihuahua's head is large, it can be physically too big to pass. If you see paws appear at the vulval lips and notice that the dog continues to strain but that after 60 minutes no puppy is passed, you should contact your vet. Do not pull on the paws as you could cause internal tearing. In general, you should contact your vet if:The dog does not start hard labor after 24 hours in the first stage of labor.
No puppy is produced after 60 minutes of hard straining.
The dog appears to be in extreme or abnormal pain.
Not all of the puppies have been born, but the dog has not pushed for 2 hours.

Keep in mind that some dogs rest between individual deliveries. A dog can relax for up to 2 hours before the next bout of hard labor.
However, if you know how many puppies she is carrying, and they have not all been delivered but her hard contractions stopped more than 2 hours ago, you should be concerned.



, The puppies may be born either tail or head first; both are normal.When the mother delivers, each pup will be in its own amniotic sac; the mother should tear it open, then chew off the umbilical cord, and lick the pup. It's usually best to let her do this without human assistance because it is part of her bonding with the puppies. Don't be afraid to give the mother a few minutes to get the hang of things.If she doesn’t tear open the sac within a maximum of two minutes, you should gently open it with a clean hand. Remove the slippery covering and rub the puppy with a clean towel. Tie the umbilical cord in a knot about one inch from the pup and cut with scissors on the far side of the knot.If the pup is unresponsive, clear all fluid away from the pup’s nose and mouth. Rub the pup vigorously but with gentle pressure to stimulate breathing. Encourage the mother to lick her baby. You may need to put the pup in front of her several times, particularly if this is her first litter.

, This is the passing of the ""afterbirths"", or placentas. Usually this occurs after each pup. Try to check how many placentas have been passed, so you that will notice if any are left in the uterus. If this is the case, contact your vet.Your dog will likely eat the placentas; do not interfere with her ability to do so, as this is a normal biological process.

, It’s important for both mother and puppies to receive enough nutrition so that the mother can recover and the puppies can develop healthily.


Most dogs will eat the placenta and afterbirth. This is very nutrient-rich and gives the mother a much-needed burst of energy to care for her young.
Feed your nursing mother puppy food. Be prepared to feed her up to 3 times her normal intake of food. Clean, fresh water must be available at all times. Place these near her puppies so that she will not need to leave them to eat and drink. Insufficient food or water will trigger the mother's milk to dry up.

, Expect things to go well but be prepared for complications. Because chihuahuas are a small breed, infections can quickly become life-threatening. Consult your vet if you suspect your dog has any of the following:Metritus (an inflamed uterus) - Symptoms include fever, foul-smelling discharge, listlessness, loss of appetite, decreased milk production, and disinterest in the puppies.Eclampsia (or 'milk fever') - Symptoms include nervousness, restlessness, disinterest in the puppies, and a stiff, pained gait. If left untreated, eclampsia can progress into muscle spasms, inability to stand, fever, seizures, and death. This condition usually develops about 2-4 weeks after delivery.Mastitis (inflammation of the breasts) - Symptoms include red, hardened, or painful mammary glands. The mother may try to discourage the puppies from nursing, but you want them to continue doing so, as it can help flush out the infection (without causing the puppies any harm)., The general rule of thumb after the mother has given birth is to watch out that she doesn’t stop caring for the pups or show signs of feeling ill.A healthy mother will be alert and attentive to her newborns. She will only leave them for bathroom breaks and will want to rush back to them quickly. Her time should be spent licking them and feeding them.She may or may not eat, but she should relive herself normally and drink water. She will still be bleeding but should not be in pain.

Start your chihuahua wearing clothes for small amounts of time.,
Be sure your chihuahua's clothes are comfortable and fit well.,
Make it positive with treats and attention.,
Supervise your Chihuahua to redirect chewing and biting on fashions.",How to Encourage Your Chihuahua to Wear Clothes,"  At first it's better not to have your Chihuahua wear their clothes for too long.  You want them to get used to them gradually.  It is better to start with 30 minutes to an hour of clothes wearing at first rather than a whole day.  If your Chihuahua is happy in his clothes than fine but for those who aren't as sure of them you will want to keep the times short in the beginning.  It's important to remember that your Chihuahua will still enjoy lots of time not wearing clothes!;
,  No one likes to wear clothes that are itchy, scratchy, or that just do not fit well and your Chihuahua is no exception.  Clothes should not be so big that they get in the way of your dogs play and normal activities nor should they be too tight around the chest or front legs.  Putting clothes that do not fit well on your Chihuahua is a good way to make him decide that clothes are a bad idea.  You will want to be sure that tags are not an issue and avoid anything too frilly or bulky until your Chihuahua is already used to clothes.  First clothes should be little shirts and simple dresses.  Think comfort.

,  One of the best ways to ensure success with training your Chihuahua to wear clothes is to offer treats and just fuss over them when dressed. Dress them up for fun things like outings and walks.  This builds a positive association with their clothes for your dog.  Even chihuahuas who do not care for clothes as much are still cooperative because they know that getting dressed means something fun is coming around the corner for them.  This 'fun' can be an outing, a walk, some playtime, treats or anything your dog enjoys.  Just be sure to always have a fun activity or a tasty treat ready for your Chi once dressed.

,  This can be a common problem especially when starting puppies with clothing. Get your dog dressed when you have time to spend with them.  This way you can be making this a fun attention filled time for your Chihuahua AND you are available to redirect their chewing on their clothes and keep them distracted so that they just forget about them altogether since they are having so much fun with you!

Bathe your Beagle once a month.,
Gather the bathing supplies.,
Use lukewarm water for the bath.,
Protect your Beagle’s ears.,
Bathe your Beagle.",How to Groom a Beagle1," Beagles have short, thick coats that usually don’t get very dirty. Because your Beagle’s coat will probably look clean, you may not think your Beagle needs a bath. However, after a few weeks, body oils and hair can pile up on your Beagle’s skin, causing a bad smell.If your Beagle likes playing in the mud or dirt, you’ll probably need to bathe it more often than once a month.;
, To give your Beagle a good bath, you’ll need a few bathing supplies. You can find these supplies at your local pet store and around your home:Dog-safe shampoo
Cotton balls for the ears
Soft washcloth
Towels
Soft-bristled bathing brush (optional)

, Lukewarm water will be just the right temperature for your Beagle’s bath. If you have an adult Beagle, bathe it in a bathtub. If your Beagle is a puppy, bathe it in a sink because it's so small.Put three to four inches of water in the tub or sink., Beagles have long floppy ears that can trap moisture and become infected.Before the bath, put a few pieces of cotton balls in your Beagle’s ears to keep them from getting wet during the bath.You don’t need to push the cotton balls far down into the ear canals. Place them down just far enough so they don’t fall out.

, Working from front to back, gently bathe your Beagle with the shampoo. Work your fingers or bathing brush through the coat so you get down to the skin. If your Beagle’s coat has a lot of mud or dirt, you may need to shampoo your Beagle several times to get everything out.


Dampen a soft wash cloth with the lukewarm water to clean your Beagle’s face and around its eyes.Rinse the shampoo completely out of your Beagle’s skin and coat. If you’re in the tub, you can use the shower head if your Beagle isn’t afraid of it.
Dry off your Beagle with several towels. Don’t be surprised if your Beagle starts rolling around as soon as you dry it off. It will do this to try to get rid of the shampoo’s scent."

Clean your Beagle’s ears once a week.,
Use a dog-specific ear cleaner.,
Clean the ears properly.,
Check your Beagle’s ears regularly.",How to Groom a Beagle2," A Beagle’s long, floppy ears make Beagles look so cute. However, without proper care, those ears can become infected. Clean your Beagle’s ears once a week to keep them from getting infected., Ear cleaners are available at your local pet store or through your vet. Ask your vet to recommend which ear cleaner would be best for your Beagle.

, Place a few drops of the ear cleaner on a cotton ball and gently swab the cotton ball from the inside to the outside of your Beagle’s ears.If your Beagle’s ears have a lot of wax or debris, you may need to use a few cotton balls in each ear to get them clean.


Use separate cotton balls for each ear so you don’t transfer wax or debris from one ear to the other.
Do not clean your Beagle’s ears with Q-tips. Q-tips push wax down into your Beagle’s ears.They can also damage your Beagle’s ear drums.
Ear hair can trap moisture and debris, increasing the chance of ear infections. If your Beagle has a lot of hair in its ears, gently pluck the hairs with your fingers or a small pair of tweezers., Keeping your Beagle’s ears healthy will require regular monitoring. Healthy Beagle ears will not smell or have any cuts or scrapes.Unhealthy ears may be infected. If you notice any of the following signs of ear problems, take your Beagle to your vet:Ear scratching
Colored discharge (brown, yellow, red)
Bad smell
Redness

Brush your Beagle every few days.,
Keep your Beagle’s nose moist.,
Trim your Beagle’s nails.,
Brush your Beagle’s teeth.",How to Groom a Beagle3," Despite having a short hair coat, Beagles tend to shed a lot. Brushing your Beagle a few times a week will help reduce the shedding.Regular brushing will also spread healthy oils through your Beagle’s fur, making it look shiny.Beagles shed heavily for a few weeks in the spring and fall. During these times of year, you may need to brush your Beagle every day to control the shedding.Each brushing session should last about 5 to 10 minutes.A rubber brush will help remove dirt from the coat and distribute the healthy oils through the coat.A hard-bristle brush is also a good choice.Brushing will be most effective if you move the brush in the same direction of your Beagle’s hair growth.Do not use the brush on your Beagle’s face.

, A dry nose is a common problem in Beagles. It can be caused by sun exposure, dry air, and dehydration. If your Beagle has a dry nose, you may notice the nose’s skin cracking or peeling. To keep your Beagle’s nose moist:Use humidifiers to add moisture to your home during the winter. Humidifiers are available at pharmacies and home improvement stores.
Give your Beagle constant access to fresh, clean water.
Apply a dog-specific nose balm to your Beagle’s nose, especially when it’s really hot or cold outside. You can find the balm at your local pet store.

, Keeping your Beagle’s nails trimmed is another important part of the grooming process. You will know it’s time for a trimming when the nails make a clicking sound as your Beagle walks on hard surfaces.Below are some tips for trimming your Beagle's nails:Use dog-specific guillotine nail trimmers, which are easier to use than scissor trimmers.
Position the trimmers just above the nail's quick (thin pink vein running though the nail) with the cutting blade facing you. If you can't see the quick because your Beagle's nails are dark, trim just a little off the nail until you see the quick.
Do not trim the quick. Trimming the quick is painful and can cause bleeding.
If the nail bleeds, place some styptic powder (available at your local pet store) on the nail until it stops bleeding.

, Just like you, your Beagle’s teeth need to be cleaned regularly. Try to brush your Beagle’s teeth about three times a week. Use a dog-safe toothpaste and toothbrush, which you can purchase at a pet store or through your vet.Here are some teeth brushing tips:Choose a quiet time and location to brush the teeth.
Get your Beagle used to the process by first touching its teeth with your fingers, then placing a toothbrush (without toothpaste) on its teeth. Next, let your Beagle lick the toothpaste off your finger so it knows what it tastes like.
On the top and bottom, brush the front teeth first, then work your way to the back teeth.
Give your Beagle lots of verbal praise as you brush its teeth.

Seek the treatment advice of your vet.,
Give your Beagle steroids.,
Talk to your vet if the prednisone isn’t working.,
Give your Beagle a chemotherapeutic drug.,
Administer levamisole to your Beagle.,
Ask your vet about leflunomide.,
Treat the underlying cause of the polyarthritis.,
Follow all prescription instructions carefully.,
Monitor your Beagle for negative side effects.,
Have your Beagle’s joint fluid analyzed.",How to Treat Polyarthritis in Beagles," The treatment goals for polyarthritis are to reduce joint inflammation and treat the underlying trigger (if there is one) causing the immune response. Achieving these goals will allow your Beagle to be in remission—free from any signs of polyarthritis.Your Beagle will need prescription medicine available through your vet.


Over-the-counter medications will not be strong enough to treat your Beagle. In addition, since they are for people, they may not be safe for your Beagle.;
, Suppressing the immune system with steroids will reduce joint inflammation. Prednisone, a steroid, is the mainstay of polyarthritis treatment in Beagles.To begin treatment, your vet will prescribe an immunosuppressive dose of prednisone. Your Beagle will remain on this dose until the polyarthritis is in remission.As your Beagle’s symptoms improve, your vet will slowly lower the prednisone dose. Lowering the dose too quickly could result in a flare up (disease recurrence).To keep the polyarthritis under control, your vet may prescribe a long-term, low dose of prednisone to be given every other day.You will give the steroid pill by mouth. Rather than putting the pill directly in your Beagle’s mouth, try hiding the pill in the food at mealtime. You could also put the pill in a small chewy treat, such as Greenies®.

, About 50% of dogs achieve remission with prednisone treatment.If prednisone is not effective in your Beagle, then you will need to discuss other treatment options with your vet. Other treatments options include chemotherapeutic drugs and drugs those that modify the immune system (immunomodulatory drugs).Chemotherapeutic drugs are typically used to treat cancer, but can be effective treatments for polyarthritis.

, Azathioprine and cyclophosphamide are chemotherapeutic drugs.They are given with prednisone if prednisone alone does not lead to remission. Treatment with azathioprine or cyclophosphamide typically lasts 2‒4 months. If your Beagle achieves remission after this time period, your vet will slowly reduce the dosage and maybe even discontinue use of the drug.Both drugs are given by mouth.

, Levamisole is primarily used to kill intestinal parasites, but can also modify the immune system. It is used in combination with prednisone if polyarthritis comes back after initial treatment.Levamisole is given by mouth either every other day or three times a week.Your vet will prescribe how often you should administer levamisole.


Levamisole enhances the immune system function.Although this effect is opposite to what should work to treat polyarthritis, levamisole still appears to be effective.

, Leflunomide also modifies the immune system. It can be used with prednisone to treat polyarthritis. Your vet will advise you to give it by mouth daily for a few days. After about 2 weeks, your vet will take a blood sample from your Beagle to measure the drug’s blood levels. Your vet will adjust the dosage up or down depending on the blood work results and the improvement of symptoms.Leflunomide suppresses the immune system and reduces inflammation., If your vet identified cause of the polyarthritis at the time of diagnosis, they will prescribe treatment to target that cause. For example, if a bacterial infection is causing the polyarthritis, then your Beagle will need an antibiotic. In some cases, treating the underlying cause is all that’s needed to resolve the polyarthritis. However, your vet may also prescribe a steroid if the joint inflammation is severe.Polyarthritis that has a known cause is typically called reactive polyarthritis.

, Your Beagle’s treatment will be more successful if you administer the medications as prescribed. Complete the full treatment course, even if your Beagle starts to improve. If you stop the treatment before talking to your vet, your Beagle’s polyarthritis may come back.


If you have any questions about how to give the drugs, or about the treatment in general, ask them during your appointment. Or, call the vet’s office if you come up with questions later.

, During the course of treatment, your Beagle may experience negative side effects from the drugs. For example, long-term prednisone use can cause urinary tract infections. Azathioprine and cyclophosphamide can suppress bone marrow function, which would decrease red blood cell production and lead to anemia.Anemia would make your Beagle feel weak and tired.


Dogs typically tolerate leflunomide very well. However, it can cause diarrhea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and skin ulcers.If your Beagle experiences these side effects, contact your vet right away. Do not stop giving the drug, or give less of it, unless your vet tells you to do so.

, Regardless of which drug regimen your Beagle is receiving, your vet will need to analyze a joint fluid sample to monitor treatment response.To withdraw the fluid with a needle and syringe, your vet will sedate your Beagle so it doesn’t feel any pain.Your vet will analyze the sample under the microscope to look for inflammatory cells. A lack of inflammatory cells is an indication of remission.


Your vet will let you know how often you should bring your Beagle in for a joint fluid analysis.
Not all dog owners like the idea of having the joint fluid repeatedly analyzed.If you are not comfortable with this procedure, ask your vet about monitoring your Beagle’s treatment response by looking for improvement of symptoms and changes in blood work (if there were any blood work abnormalities at the time of diagnosis).A clinical response to treatment would include the absence of lameness and stiffness, two common clinical signs of polyarthritis."

Choose an anticonvulsant.,
Give treatment regularly.,
Prepare to help your dog with the side effects of anticonvulsants.,
Give your dog medication to minimize additional seizures.,
Document your dog's seizures.,
Make the environment safe for your dog.,
Be on the look out for seizures.,
Look for secondary behavioral symptoms.,
Keep an eye on breeds that are more likely to have epilepsy.",How to Treat Epilepsy in Beagles," Your vet will do some testing to rule out other possible causes for the seizures. If no cause for the beagle's seizures is identifiable, the dog is assumed to have epilepsy.


The veterinarian may want to test for poisoning, liver disease, diabetes, kidney disease, and anemia, among other health issues.At this point, treatment depends on the use of anticonvulsant drugs to suppress abnormal electrical activity in the brain, rather than treating the underlying cause.;
, Anticonvulsant drugs do have side effects, so whether to treat a beagle for epilepsy or not depends on weighing up a number of factors. As a general rule of thumb, those dogs that need treatment are those who have severe, prolonged seizures (lasting more than 5 minutes each), frequent seizures, or clusters of seizures.There is no set rule as to what ""frequent"" seizures are, and this is usually assessed on an individual basis against how severe the fit is and if the dog has clusters (groups of seizures on the same day). One seizure a month is usually the threshold at which therapy is started., There are different anticonvulsants that are available. Different anticonvulsant drugs work in different ways, and around 25-33% of epileptic dogs require more than one medication in order to satisfactorily control their symptoms.Two drugs are currently licensed for use in dogs for the treatment of epilepsy and these are Epiphen (phenobarbitone) and Pexion (Imepitoin).


Pexion: This is a relatively new drug that builds up to therapeutic levels in the bloodstream much faster than Epiphen. The dog is started at an initial dose of 10mg/ kg, which is given as a tablet by mouth every 12 hours. The drug is more effective given on an empty stomach, and dosing should be kept as close to every 12 hours as possible. Pexion reaches a steady therapeutic level within 7 days, which is considerably faster than for alternative drugs. Pexion should not be given to beagles with serious liver or kidney disease.
Epiphen: Epiphen has been available for much longer than Pexion and is more commonly used. However, it takes at least two weeks to climb to therapeutic levels in the blood, so decisions about dose adjustments should not be made during that time. Epiphen is strongly associated with ravenous appetite, increased thirst, and poor coordination on the back legs, and is not a drug that suits all dogs. High doses cause more severe side effects, so rather than increase the dose to high levels, introducing a second anticonvulsant may be the better option.

, Once started on anticonvulsants, it is essential that the medication is given regularly and not stopped suddenly.To do so risks the patient having more severe seizures in the future.


Drugs such as Epiphen have a short acting effect and if the next dose of drug is late, the dip in blood levels can be sufficient to induce a seizure in some patients.
Never adjust the dose of an anticonvulsant medication without first speaking to your vet., Anticonvulsant drugs have side effects, such as sedation, hunger, or thirst, which can seriously interfere with the dog's quality of life. The dose of drug that would completely prevent seizures might well make the dog so sleepy and poorly coordinated that it can't take part in normal family life.


The drugs can also cause liver damage. The aim of treatment is therefore a compromise between reducing the frequency of the seizures by at least half, while maintaining the dog's good quality life., Dogs that are not started on anticonvulsants because their seizures are infrequent (less frequent than once a month) or mild, may be supplied with a diazepam rectal suppository. This is given to the dog immediately after a seizure, as the diazepam is absorbed through the rectal mucosa to enter the bloodstream where it dampens down electrical activity in the brain and makes another seizure in the next few hours less likely.


This is helpful because in some dogs, one seizure follows on the coattails of another, in what are called seizure clusters. Giving diazepam can decrease the likelihood of this happening., You should maintain a log of seizures so you can really understand how often and how severe they are. You should also take video of seizures, if you can. This will be good information to share with a vet.The log should include the date, the time, and the length of the seizures.

, When a dog has seizures it's important to remove dangerous objects from the area, so that it does not get injured.If you can, move furniture that has sharp edges and hard objects away from a seizing dog.


If you have a dog with a history of seizures, it may be a good idea to take items that it could hurt itself on out of the areas is spends its time in. For example, if your dog's bed is next to a sharply-edged table, you should move either the bed or table.

, Beagles that have epilepsy will have seizures. During the seizure itself, the dog loses consciousness, and often lies on its side and paddles uncontrollably with the legs. The dog's jaw may also be clenched.


The owner should take care not to be bitten, as the dog won't be able to release their bite.
Many dogs also lose control of their bladder and bowels during a fit.Most seizures last for just a couple of minutes.

, Dogs about to have seizures often have a phase of strange behavior preceding the seizure. This strange behavior may include restlessness, being unsettled, and being clingy.


Your dog may also come to you seeking reassurance.

, Some dog breeds have an inherited component to their epilepsy and acquire genes from their parents that makes seizures more likely. The beagle is one of these breeds.


Along with beagles, Cocker spaniels, Dachshunds, German shepherds, Irish setters, Labrador retrievers, golden retrievers, poodles and keeshonds have high rates of epilepsy."

Don't rule out arthritis as the cause of a young dog's mobility problems.,
Take your dog to its veterinarian.,
Discuss the need for additional testing.,
Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for treatment.",How to Diagnose Polyarthritis in Beagles," The most common signs of the illness are associated with lameness. For example, the gait of a dog suffering a flare up is described as ""walking on eggshells."", The affected joint will be stiffer and have a reduced range of movement compared to other joints. There may be some cracking and pain associated with gentle flexion of the joint. The stiffness is usually worse when the dog gets up from rest, and may ease a little with gentle exercise depending on how mild or severe the flare up is. In severe cases it is too painful to walk and the dog may refuse to get up.

, The individual joints that are affected may be swollen. The disease usually affects the wrist, hock, knee or elbow, so inspecting these joints is a good idea.Usually more than one joint is affected, and it is often the matching joint on the opposite side that is sore, for example both elbows or both wrist joints.If in doubt about whether a joint is swollen, compare one joint to its matching joint on the dog. However, this may not be helpful if the joints on both sides are affected.

, The joint may feel hot to the touch. This can help signal that the joint may be arthritic.Lay your palm over a normal joint and then compare how it feels with the suspected joint to see if their is a temperature difference.

, Some dogs will be feverish in addition to have problems with their movement. If you don't have any way to take your dog's temperature, you can look of the signs of a fever. Dogs with a fever are liable to be listless or lethargic, and lose interest in food.Tiredness in combination with losing interest in food can signal a variety of different illnesses. If your dog has these symptoms, it should be taken to its veterinarian to have its health assessed.

, The symptoms of polyarthritis usually wax and wane. The dog may be stiff and sore for a few days and then seem to recover, only to relapse at some point in the future.If your dog has experienced any incidences of lameness, its best to get it checked out by a vet. In fact, it is better to get the condition treated before it becomes a constant issue for your pet than to wait for the problem to get really bad.

, The condition can develop at any age. In fact, polyarthritis is actually more common in young or middle aged animals, than older ones., If your Beagle shows any of these signs, then get it checked by your vet. Your vet will take a thorough history, including any recent episodes of ill health and your beagle's vaccination status.


The vet will watch the dog walking and feel all the joints to see if any are painful, swollen, or have a reduced range of movement.

, This will make the cost of your veterinary visit more expensive but will allow your veterinarian to make a more specific diagnosis. If the vet is suspicious of polyarthritis they will run blood tests to look for markers of inflammation and changes in white cells, which can indicate a general reaction to inflammation, and also to rule out other causes of fever or ill health.


To specifically diagnose polyarthritis, the vet will want to test a sample of the joint fluid for markers of abnormal inflammation and to study the types of white cell present.In addition, the vet will take radiographs. Sometimes, if the problem has been ongoing for a while, it is possible to see erosions in the joint lining where the immune system has 'eaten away' at the lining of the joints.These tests may need to be done under sedation as they are likely to be uncomfortable for your dog and will make it sore afterword.

, Treatment involves the use of immunosuppressive doses of anti-inflammatory drugs, such as steroids like Prednisone.In this case, the idea is that immunosuppressants suppress the immune system enough that it stops attacking the joints enough for them to heal.


In an immune-mediated condition, the body turns its defenses on itself and attacks its own tissues. The reasons it does this are often times puzzling and in some cases no reason is identified, in which case it is known as 'idiopathic'. But in other cases there is a link to trauma (causing inappropriate swelling which triggers the reaction), cancer, drugs, vaccine reactions, or genetics, which triggers an episode.
With polyarthritis, what seems to happen is the antibodies trigger an inflammatory reaction, which releases a cascade of chemicals and inflammatory agents. This encourages more antibody complexes to flood into the joint and a vicious cycle of inflammation develops.Some veterinarians that use alternative medicine treatments may also suggest using homeopathy to treat the illness. Instead of suppressing the immune system, this treatment seeks to find the underlying source of the problem and treat that."

In addition, he might rub his ears on nearby objects to relieve the itch.If the ear infection is really bothersome, your beagle may shake his head so much that a large blood clot, called a hematoma, forms in his ear.Your beagle may feel so miserable that he becomes withdrawn.If you try to touch your beagle’s ears, he may cry out or whine. He may even become aggressive because of how sensitive and painful his ears feel.;
, If your beagle has a severe ear infection, he may start tilting his head down to one side or the other.The side on which he tilts his head indicates the bothersome ear. If both ears are bothering him, he may tilt his head from one side to the other.

, Infections caused by an organism (e.g., yeast, bacteria, fungus) can make a dog’s ears smell pretty bad. If your beagle will let you, lift the flap of one ear and take a whiff. A strong, foul odor indicates an ear infection., Discharge is a common sign of ear infection. The discharge can be various colors, including yellow, green, or black. If your beagle has ear mites, the discharge could be very thick., Mites are little parasites that can cause major irritations in a beagle’s ears. They can burrow deep in your beagle’s ear canal and cause major swelling and irritation when they bite the skin in the ear. They also reproduce very quickly, so it wouldn’t take long for your beagle to have a serious mite problem.Mites are too small to be seen with the naked eye, but you would be able to see evidence of the mites: thick red or brown crusts and dark coffee ground-like bumps., Sometimes, a foreign object, like a grass seed or pebble, can get stuck in your beagle’s ears and lead to an infection. If you can see the object, you can try to gently pull it out with your fingers or a pair of tweezers. If you cannot see it or pull it out, leave it in place and take your beagle to your vet.Realize that pulling out the foreign object will not treat the ear infection. It will just remove the source of the irritation.

, Ear infections in beagles need immediate care. In addition to making your beagle feel even more miserable, an untreated an ear infection could lead to permanent hearing loss and cause illness in other parts of his body., Your vet will use an instrument called an otoscope to take a closer look inside your beagle’s ears. They will also take a sample of the debris and/or discharge in his ears and look at it under the microscope.If your beagle’s ears are really painful and sensitive, your beagle would need to be sedated for the exam.


Your vet will examine your beagle as a whole to identify other potential causes of the ear infection (e.g., diabetes, diseases of the immune system).Food allergies can cause chronic ear infections in dogs.If your vet suspects a food allergy, then you would need to conduct a food elimination trial with your vet’s guidance.

, In general, treatment for ear infections involves cleaning and medicating the ears. The type of medication needed depends on the cause of the infection (e.g., antibiotics for a bacterial infection, antifungals for a yeast infection). Steroids are used to reduce inflammation.If your beagle has a severe infection, he will need a veterinary ear cleaning. For the procedure, your vet would anesthetize your beagle, flush his ears out with warm water and put medication in the ears.Underlying health conditions would need to be treated and/or managed along with the ear infection.
If mites are causing the ear infection, your vet will prescribe a medication to kill the mites.
Surgery is a ‘last resort’ option for chronic ear infections when there is so much scarring that the ear canal is nearly closed. A veterinary specialist would remove the entire ear canal. Although this procedure is expensive, it is very effective at preventing future ear infections., Successful treatment of your beagle’s ear infection depends on you administering the medications exactly as prescribed. When you clean his ears, apply the prescribed number of drops of ear cleaning solution into his ears, massage his ears for about 1 minute, then wipe his ears dry with some cotton balls or gauze. Don’t be surprised if your beagle shakes his head when you apply the drops—this is normal.Try not to touch the tip of the treatment bottle to his ear, since this could transfer dirt or the disease-causing organism to the bottle. If the tip touches his ear, clean it off with a clean piece of cotton ball or gauze.Over-the-counter ear cleaning solutions are available at your local pet store. Ask your vet for recommendations on which product to purchase.
Treatment usually takes 3 to 7 days, but may take longer if the ear infection is severe., Your beagle’s floppy ears are prone to reinfection, so you will need to be diligent about preventing future ear infections. One way to do this is to clean his ears at least once a week. If he has had chronic ear infections, you may need to clean his ears every day.Your vet can recommend the ideal ear cleaning frequency for your beagle.


Schedule your beagle’s ear cleanings for the same day and same time each week. Be aware that regular cleanings may not completely prevent future ear infections, but will reduce their frequency.Do not use medicated ear drops after you clean his ears, even if you have some left over from his treatment. Overuse of antibiotic ear drops can lead to the growth of bacteria that is resistant to most forms of antibiotics.This can make future infections very difficult to treat.

, Your beagle’s long and floppy ears prevent good air circulation within the ears. Without much air flow, heat and moisture can get trapped in the ears, which can lead to an infection. To increase air flow, flip his ears on top of his head so his outer ears are exposed to air. If he flips them back, use some cotton gauze and tape to secure his ears to the top of his head.When you have his hears flipped back onto the top of his head, wrap the gauze once or twice around his head. Wrap the gauze firmly, but not so tightly that your beagle is uncomfortable.
The gauze is not adhesive, so you will need the tape to keep the gauze together.
You do not have to leave your beagle’s ears flipped up all day—he probably wouldn’t tolerate having his ears like this for very long. Talk with your veterinarian about how long to keep his ears up in this fashion.

, If your beagle has a food allergy, then switching his food would be key to preventing future ear infections. Based on the results of the food elimination trial, your vet would be able to identify the ‘culprit’ ingredient. For dogs, common food culprits include beef, chicken, and dairy products.Feeding him a diet that does not contain the allergy-causing ingredient can help prevent future ear infections.


Be aware that a diet with a novel protein source (a protein your beagle hasn’t eaten before) may help prevent ear infections for a while, but may not be as effective once your beagle’s digestive system becomes used to the protein.
A meat-based diet that is low in yeast may help prevent yeast-based ear infections.Talk with your veterinarian before making any changes to your beagle’s diet.

At eight weeks, take your beagle to the vet to check his overall health as well as him early vaccinations. These include those for distemper, rabies, and Lyme disease.Talk to your vet about a regiment of preventative medication for heartworms as well. This disease can cause illness and even death.
After the first checkup, your beagle will need a booster shot for his vaccinations.
Once he is older, he will need a yearly checkup.;
, Once your dog is six to nine months old, consider fixing your pet. This can help with certain diseases, such as tumors, cancer, and urinary tract infections. It will also help you avoid unwanted puppies and certain behavioral issues.


Avoid doing this if you plan on breeding your dog.Make sure to research this matter further, as new studies are coming out all the time regarding the health concerns of spaying/nuetering while the beagle is young.

, There are certain issues that may arise because of your dog is a beagle. This means that your beagle will be more prone to these disorders than other breeds. These issues include:


Seizure disorders
Hypothyroidism
Allergies
Hip dysplasia
Inter-vertebral disc disease, There are many foods you can feed your dog, but you need to look for the highest quality dog food that is made for small breeds. Your beagle will do well with commercial dog food as long as the food contains quality ingredients that are specialized for small breeds. The first three or four ingredients should be meat and vegetables.


It can contain meat by-products and wheat, but they should be farther down the list., If your dog doesn't do well on commercial food or if you want to make it yourself, consider a raw diet. If you choose this path, contact your vet to find an animal nutritionist to help you provide a balanced diet for your beagle. If it isn't, your dog's quality of life may suffer.5

, In order to keep your dog in the right weight range, you need to feed him the recommended amounts every day. To help you do this, measure the amount of food with a measuring cup at each meal. This will ensure you don't overfeed or underfeed him. Look on the back of your dog's food to see the proper amount for him.


This is typically based on weight, so make sure you know how much he ways so you can feed him the right amount.
Overfeeding can lead to obesity, which is the largest nutritional issue facing dog’s today.If you follow the recommended amount of food, avoid feeding him more than a treat or two a day because it will increase his calorie intake., In order to keep you and your dog healthy and happy, you need to potty train him. It takes patience, time, and continued work. You need to set up a feeding and walking routine and enforcing good behavior when he goes to the bathroom outside. You may also need to paper train him if you live in an apartment.


The length of time it takes to potty train will vary depending on your dog. Keep at it and your dog will eventually learn.
Keep you dog in a small, easily cleanable area while you are potty training him, such as a bathroom or laundry room., A good way to train your dog is with a crate. This can help keep your beagle in a contained area when you aren't around and will help you travel with him. It isn't bad for you dog if he is trained to use the crate correctly.


Start by putting the crate with a blanket or bed inside in a place where he is comfortable. Encourage him to come inside with a treat for a few days just to get him inside. After a few days, close the door behind him for 10 minutes at a time. Then, slowly increase it until he is used to it and can stay in there for long periods of time.
Make sure you buy a crate that is an appropriate size for your dog. He needs plenty of space to move around and be comfortable. He should be able to stand normally without a hunched back and be able to turn around comfortably while in the crate.
The crate does not have to be bigger than this., Your beagle should be happy and energetic, which means he needs to exercise every day. This includes two walks that last at least 20 minutes a piece. If you beagle is a puppy or elderly, the walks can be shorter at 15 minutes or less.


You can also play interactive games with your beagles, such as fetch or Frisbee., Your beagle is a social animal since he was originally bred to be in packs. This means you need to socialize your dog with other dogs as well as other humans. Take him to a dog park or a community park so he can play with other dogs and can meet other people as well.


He, like other beagles, will love to play and will have an energetic, carefree spirit. This means he will love to play with you and other dogs. Buy toys you can throw and that he can chase across the yard.
You can also take him to obedience classes, which will help socialize him as well as teach him good behavior., Your beagle will build up plaque on his teeth just like you do. This means you need to focus on his teeth, which can be done with dental formulated treats as well as brushing. Treats such as rawhides or dental treats help clean the plaque as your dog chews. In addition to these treats, brush his teeth every few days to once a week.


Start by buying a dog toothbrush and toothpaste from the pet store or your vet. Never use human toothpaste because it is poisonous to dogs.
Use a small amount of toothpaste on your finger to get him used to taste and you being in his mouth. Rub it along his gums, then work up to brushing his teeth. Work from the back to front on the outside of his teeth for about 30 seconds., Trimming your dog's nails is important to prevent accidental scratching and keep him happy. Start with the back nails, which are typically shorter and easier to handle. When you go to cut his nails, look for the quick, which you can see on the underside of the nails. These contain blood vessels and will bleed if you cut them. Move two to three millimeter from the quick, trimming from there. Do the same for each nail.


The first time you do this, ask someone to help by holding your dog. He might jerk and cause you to hurt him.
Make sure you buy a dog nail trimmer. Never use scissors or human nail trimmers.
If you aren't sure how to do it yourself, ask your vet to show you.
If your dog is older and arthritic, it may cause him pain when you cut his nails.

, Your beagle's coat may be short haired, but that doesn't mean he doesn't have to be brushed. He is prone to shedding, and brushing him regularly will help cut down on his shedding. Buy a short bristled brush to help remove loose fur and stimulate skin circulation and skin health.


While you do this, also look for fleas, ticks, and other skin conditions or abnormality. If you find parasites on him, treat them as soon as you can. This includes his skin as well as bedding and your house."

In addition, your vet can provide you with guidance about how to best care for your new teacup chihuahua, particularly since there are health problems associated with this type of dog.


In addition, your veterinarian can provide any vaccinations your dog may need.;
, It's easy to overfeed teacup chihuahuas because they are so small. Therefore, many chihuahuas are at risk for being overweight. Limit the amount of food you feed your chihuahua each day, including treats.Since most teacup chihuahuas are under 5 pounds, 1/2 a cup of dog food or less each day is enough.If you notice your dog is gaining weight, try reducing it's food intake.

, Small dogs like teacup chihuahuas are more prone to stress. Because they are so small, you may be want to carry them around with you, which can cause more stress. Learning ways to reduce your pet's stress is important for its health and well-being.Give the dog a place to retreat to that is a low-stress environment, such as a room that is relatively quiet. You can also have a crate with bedding in it.
Try not to make loud noises around your chihuahua.
In addition, don't hand your chihuahua over to someone to hold if your dog doesn't already know the person. Being handed to an unknown person can stress the dog out.

, Small dogs like chihuahuas mean small bladders. You need to let them go to the bathroom more often, or you'll end up with a puddle on the floor. One way to remind yourself is to set a timer at regular intervals during the day to remind yourself to let your dog out, once you figure out your dog's bathroom needs., Adult chihuahuas should get about 30 minutes of exercise every day, usually in the form of a walk. Swimming is also good exercise, as long as you are supervising the chihuahua during the exercise.On hot days, think about the heat of the pavement. If you wouldn't walk on it barefoot, your chihuahua shouldn't either. Also, try to go outside when it's cooler out on hot days.
Use a harness instead of a collar, as it is less likely to cause injury and makes it more difficult for your chihuahua to slip out of it.

, Small dogs, including teacup chihuahuas, have a reputation for being snappy and somewhat aggressive. However, this behavior isn't more innate to small dogs than it is to large dogs. Rather, it's just more tolerated in small dogs because it's seen as cute or less dangerous.In other words, you need treat this behavior in your dog the same way you would in a large dog. If you saw a large dog growling and snapping at someone, would you let that behavior continue? No, you'd put a stop to it. You need to employ the same techniques with your small dog, even if it seems ""cute"" at the time.

, You may have noticed that your teacup chihuahua is often shivering. That's because they are so small that they are often cold. To help combat the coldness, consider buying a sweater for your chihuahua. It's best to start your dog on a sweater when it's young so it can get used to it., Brush both short-haired and long-haired varieties at least once a week. You can use a soft bristle brush for both varieties, though you can also use a rubber grooming brush on short-haired chihuahuas. For tangles, use a tangle comb to gently pick them out., You only really need to bathe your chihuahua when it gets dirty or starts to smell. If you'd like, you can wash it several times a week to keep your furniture cleaner and the shedding down.While bathing your chihuahua, use a massaging motion, and speak gently to it to calm it down.Make sure to use a shampoo made for dogs. Look for one that says ""gentle.""
Because chihuahuas are prone to being cold anyway, make sure you don't leave the dog damp.

, Most teacup chihuahuas do not get enough exercise to keep their nails worn down, so you need to trim them when you notice them getting long. It's important to start when your dog is young so it gets used to it over time.Pick trimmers meant for dogs, as they are quieter and more effective.
Tuck your chihuahua under one arm and use one hand to hold one paw out at a time.
Always look for the quick of the nail when getting ready to trim your dog's nails. The quick is the vein that runs through the nail. It should end about halfway to the tip. You don't want to cut the quick because it hurts the dog.
The first few times try just cutting a couple of nails each time. Make sure to reward your dog afterward with petting and treats.

, Like most dogs, you should clean out your dog's ears as you notice them getting dirty. Your vet should have cleaning solutions available for your dog. Use cotton balls to wipe out your dog's ears, not going deeper than about 3/4 of an inch., Grooming can be stressful for both you and pet. If you're having problems, your best option is to go to a professional groomer. If you are strapped for cash, try finding a grooming school in your area, which trains groomers. You'll still get professional service at a cheaper rate.

, Small dogs are more susceptible to injury due to their size. In fact, teacup varieties of dogs often have brittle bones because of breeder techniques that stunt growth.The teacup chihuahua is so small that accidentally dropping one can be fatal. In addition, because they are tiny, they are more difficult to see, and they are more likely to be stepped on or hit with a car. You have to take extra care to make sure your chihuahua isn't injured.One thing that can help is to choose a brightly colored harness or collar for your dog so that the chihuahua stands out more.
In addition, make sure to supervise your dog around heights, even couches.
If you suspect your dog may have a broken bone, which you can recognize from swelling and pain in the area, take it to the vet., Due to their small size, teacup chihuahuas are more likely to get hypoglycemia. Splitting the dog's food throughout the day can help prevent hypoglycemia, since it gives your dog a steady flow of food to keep its blood sugar up. Try feeding it four times a day. In addition, it's important to watch for the signs of hypoglycemia in your dog.Watch for extreme sleepiness, weakness, or dizziness. You may also notice seizures, restlessness, and increased hunger.If you notice these symptoms, rub honey on the dog's gums, then go to a vet or veterinarian hospital.
Some chihuahuas also develop diabetes, which your doctor can help you manage. However, diabetic dog foods can help.

, Small dogs like chihuahuas can have trouble with the displacement of their kneecaps, called luxating patella. Watch for signs of this problem, which includes limping or hopping along when walking instead of walking normally. If you notice these symptoms, take your dog to the vet., Hydrocephalus, also called ""water on the brain,"" often affects smaller chihuahuas. With this condition, fluid builds up in the brain, which can lead to complications like a different walking style, a larger brain, seizures, and blindness.If you notice your dog is walking funny, that could be a sign of water on the brain. Seizures could include repeated movements or jerking. Your dog may also collapse, chomp its tongue, or foam at the mouth.If you notice symptoms of this condition, talk to your vet. You may be able to manage some of the symptoms for your pet.

, Small dogs like teacup chihuahuas are more likely to develop heart issues than larger dogs. For instance, they are more prone to developing heart murmurs and more likely to have damaged heart valves. You need to watch for signs of heart disease in your chihuahua.Signs of heart disease include listlessness, heavy breathing and panting, and coughing. You may also notice your dog stops eating or faints.
If you notice these symptoms, take your dog to the vet.

, One way to stave off health problems is to make sure your dog sees the vet on a regular basis, as the vet will be better at spotting pre-warning signs of the diseases your dog is susceptible to than you are. Your dog should see a vet at least once a year.

, Teacup chihuahuas that are less than 3 pounds are more likely to have shortened lifespans. As noted, these dogs are susceptible to many health problems, which means they often live fewer years than larger chihuahuas."

The cough is dry and usually comes after a dog has been active, excited, or quickly drinking water.If your Chihuahua starts to sound like a goose on occasion, he probably has a collapsing trachea.


Hot weather can worsen your Chihuahua’s coughing.;
, Difficulty breathing is another common sign of a collapsing trachea. When tracheal rings become weak and collapse down into the trachea, air either gets trapped in the lungs or can’t get to the lungs.Your Chihuahua may breathe more rapidly and have abnormal breathing sounds.In addition,his abdominal muscles may become tense from the extra effort he makes to breathe.Abnormal breathing sounds include clicking when breathing out and wheezing when breathing in.Difficulty breathing can lead to cyanosis, which occurs when the skin or mucus membranes don’t get enough oxygen and turn blue., If your Chihuahua becomes less active, he may have a collapsing trachea.Without the ability to breathe very well, your Chihuahua would not be able to exercise for long periods of time, if at all. In addition, since being active and excited can worsen the signs of a collapsing trachea, your Chihuahua may simply decide to stay still instead.

, Although a goose honk cough is a clear sign of a collapsing trachea, your Chihuahua will need a thorough workup by your veterinarian. He or she will analyze your Chihuahua’s blood to assess his overall health, and take chest x-rays. Chest x-rays do not always show a collapsed trachea, but can help rule out other causes of breathing problems.During the physical exam, your veterinarian will probably touch your Chihuahua’s trachea to stimulate a cough.In addition to x-rays, your veterinarian may want to use other visual diagnostic methods (e.g., fluoroscopy, endoscopy, bronchoscopy) to get a closer look at your Chihuahua’s airways and determine if his airway is infected with bacteria., Collapsing trachea treatment is either medical (non-surgical) or surgical. Generally, medical management involves weight management and using various medications to treat the airway and other related conditions. Medical management works in most dogs with a collapsing trachea; however, since a collapsing trachea usually worsens over time, surgical treatment may eventually be needed.It is best to start with medical management, then consider surgery if the condition worsens.Your veterinarian will go through each of the medications with you and indicate which ones will likely work best for your Chihuahua.

, Collapsing tracheas can range in severity. If your Chihuahua’s tracheal collapse is severe (trachea is 75‒100% collapsed), your veterinarian will probably want to hospitalize him and give him intensive care. Intensive care includes extra oxygen and heavy sedation. The sedation will calm your Chihuahua and keep him from fighting against his breathing troubles and other treatments.The length of hospitalization will depend on how long it takes your veterinarian to stabilize your Chihuahua and get him well enough for home care.

, If your Chihuahua’s tracheal collapse is mild to moderate, you can treat him at home. Treating his airways has several goals: reducing inflammation and bronchial spasms, relaxing the airways, suppressing coughing, and eliminating excessive secretions.Your veterinarian will prescribe the medications, describe how they work, and explain how to administer them.


The strain of coughing could damage the sensitive lining of your Chihuahua’s airways. Anti-inflammatory medications will reduce the damage and inflammation.
The bronchi are the two main branches of the trachea that bring air into the lungs.Bronchial spasms cause the bronchi to become narrow.Medications to relax the airways and relieve the spasms are called bronchodilators.They open up the bronchial airways and relax the lung muscles.If your veterinarian found a respiratory infection, he or she will prescribe antibiotics.The medications may take a few days to start working. Once they start working, you will start to see definite improvement in your Chihuahua’s breathing.

, Small dogs with a collapsing trachea often have heart disease as well. Other conditions that may be present are swollen lymph nodes around the trachea, dental disease, and liver disease. Treating the other conditions and tracheal collapse at the same time may improve your Chihuahua’s overall treatment outcome and prognosis., Since activity can worsen a collapsing trachea, you will need to limit your Chihuahua’s activity until his condition is more stable.For example, shorten his walks and walk him more slowly. Rather than playing an active game with him, consider spending quality quiet time with him. Your veterinarian will let you know when you can start increasing his activity level (if at all).

, Your Chihuahua may feel anxious about not being able to breathe very well. To relieve this anxiety, your veterinarian may prescribe an anti-anxiety medication.The less anxious your Chihuahua feels, the easier it will be to keep him calm during treatment.

, Overweight dogs are prone to collapsing tracheas.If your Chihuahua is overweight, help him lose weight by switching him to a weight loss diet (available commercially or at your veterinarian’s office), minimizing his treats, and eliminating table scraps from his diet. Ask your veterinarian what your Chihuahua’s ideal weight should be, and how long it should take to get him down to that ideal weight.

, When medical management of your Chihuahua’s collapsing trachea is no longer working well, he will need to have surgery. Surgical correction of a collapsing trachea is very complicated, and might be beyond the surgical abilities of your own veterinarian. Therefore, you should work with a board-certified veterinary surgeon.Veterinary surgeons at veterinary teaching hospitals and specialized veterinary surgery clinics are board certified. Consider asking your veterinarian for recommendations on veterinary surgeons.

, Two surgical treatments are available for collapsing tracheas. The first is the surgical placement of plastic rings or spirals on the outside of the trachea. The second option is placing a stent (spring-like device) in the trachea to keep it open. An advantage of stents is that their placement does not require a surgical incision.Not all dogs would benefit from surgery. Older dogs, dogs with other serious medical problems, and those with a large percentage of their trachea affected would not make good surgical candidates., Surgical treatment of a collapsing trachea is not risk free. Potential complications include bleeding within the trachea and swelling around the trachea.Other complications are continued coughing (irritation from the stent) and paralysis of the larynx.It may be difficult for your veterinary surgeon to know how likely any of these risks will be with your Chihuahua. However, the more experienced the surgeon is with collapsing trachea treatment, the less likely your Chihuahua will have serious surgical complications.

, If your Chihuahua undergoes surgery, you will need to follow the at-home care instructions provided by the veterinary surgeon. Examples of at-home care are medical management, keeping your dog away from cigarette smoke, using a body harness instead of a collar for walks, and following up with your regular veterinarian."

If you notice labored breathing early, it can help your dog avoid the discomfort of severe breathing difficulty.If you are walking your dog, continually assess how the dog is breathing and if it is having difficulty.
Signs of breathing difficulty include excessive wheezing, panting, and, in extreme cases, passing out.;
, Do not over exercise a dog that has difficulty breathing. While we all want our dogs to get plenty of exercise to stay healthy, the health of a dog with respiratory problems can actually be put at risk when forced into extreme exercise.


Once breathing becomes labored, you need to allow the dog to recover its breath.
If the dog is breathing very hard, do not ask the dog to walk to a shady spot or cool room. Instead, pick it up and carry it.
Under normal conditions, your dog should recover its breath in a few minutes. However, if it is hot or your dog has a severe respiratory issue, it may take the dog longer to recover.

, If your dog is overheated and having respiratory problems, you need to cool the dog down. If breathing becomes exaggerated, immediately let it rest in a cool place.


You should also offer it cool water to drink. This can help to cool the dog down on the inside.

, If your dog's breathing does not improve rapidly, phone your vet. Tell them you have a possible emergency. Be prepared to tell the veterinarian about your dog's symptoms and how long they have been going on.


Keep the dog calm, quiet, and cool on the way to the clinic.

, The vet can give cool intravenous fluids if the dog is overheated. The vet can also put it in an oxygen tent to aid its breathing. In addition, drugs such as corticosteroids can relieve swelling at the back of the throat, that has arisen as a result of increased breathing efforts.However, if the dog's problems are severe enough to warrant emergency treatment then corrective surgery once the dog is stable, should be considered.

, Depending on the extent and type of problem you bulldog has, it may be able to be corrected. This is especially true if the dog is young, as it will recover from surgery more easily. Your vet may consider the following options in order to improve your bulldog's breathing:Nostril surgery: Corrective surgery means removing a cake-slice of flesh from the nostrils with the intent of making the nostrils wider to facilitate breathing through the nose.
Soft palate surgery: Trimming away the excess length of soft palate means the back of the throat is clearer and the windpipe less likely to become plugged with the palate from time to time.
Laryngeal saccules removal: Specialist surgeons can remove the laryngeal saccules, hence removing another obstruction from the back of the throat.
Unfortunately, there is no surgery that can fix a relatively oversized tongue or the small diameter of the windpipe.

, Dogs that go through surgery and anesthesia may have a hard recovery. Your dog may be groggy and lethargic for quite awhile. Overall, make sure your dog is gradually recovering and follow all directions that come from your veterinary surgeon. Keep a eye on your dog for signs that it is having difficulty breathing. If it is, call the veterinarian and take the bulldog in for treatment.
Even after surgery your dog may have difficulty breathing in extreme conditions. Take sensible precautions, such as not over-exerting your dog in the heat. Also, use a harness rather than a collar, as this puts less pressure on the windpipe, making it easier to breath.

, Think of a normal dog and usually at rest they breathe steadily and silently through their nose, with no panting involved. Now consider the bulldog at rest, who is likely to pant with an open mouth, snort, and breathe so loudly you can hear it from the next room.


This is not just a cute attribute of the bulldog but indicates a compromised respiratory tract.

, When more demands are placed on its respiratory system, such as during exercise or hot weather, the signs of BAOS are exaggerated. These include:Excessive heavy panting: The dog will pant a lot, with a tongue that becomes very dry and strings of sticky saliva hanging from its lips.
Reluctance to move: The dog stubbornly refuses to move because to do so requires extra oxygen that it does not have.
Choking or snoring sounds: Typically these sounds are made as a result of the soft palate being sucked into the windpipe.
Pale or blue-tinged gums: A warning sign that the dog is distressed is that the normally pink membranes of its mouth look pale or blue-tinged.
Collapse: If the dog cannot get in enough oxygen it will collapse and faint.

, This will signal that you should be on the look out for symptoms. The significant components of BAOS include:Narrow nostrils: This makes it difficult for the bulldog to breath in through its nose
Foreshortened nose: This means the bony scrolls (or turbinates) inside the nose are compressed into a smaller space.
Large tongue: Although bony structures, such as the nose, are shortened, the tongue is a regular size. Thus the tongue takes up too much room inside the mouth and blocks the back of the throat.
Overlong soft palate: The flap of flesh at the back of the throat that separates the nose from the mouth, and prevents food going down the windpipe, is too long relative to the size of the nose. This means yet more tissue occupying the back of throat, and its location makes it prone to being sucked into the windpipe and making choking noises.
Everted laryngeal saccules: Glandular tissue at the back of the throat (equivalent to tonsils) gets sucked out of the area they should sit in. This leads to them intruding into the airway and further cutting down on the ability to breath.
Hypoplastic windpipe: Unfortunately, selectively breeding for a flat face led to selection of dogs that also have an unnaturally narrow windpipe. This means the tube connected to the lungs is too narrow, adding another layer of difficulty to breathing."

A coughing episode is most likely to be triggered by pulling on a collar or when the dog pants heavily.The cough may happen when you pick up your dog.;
, In addition to a cough, your dog may have difficulty breathing. This can be when he’s breathing normally, or when he is overly excited. This can lead to respiratory distress.Your dog may also make a wheezing noise when he breathes.Labored breathing can be triggered by irritants, like smoke and dust, obesity, or hot weather., Another sign of a collapsed trachea is intolerance during exercise. This might present itself as labored breathing or an inability to perform normal exercise., If your dog is gagging while eating and drinking, it could be a sign of a collapsed trachea. This can happen because of the restriction in the tubes.While the dog is eating and drinking, look for signs of coughing, too.

, In extreme cases, if not enough air is getting into the dog's lungs, then the membranes lining his mouth and his tongue may take on a blue tinge. The dog can also turn blue when he is excited.In extreme cases, the dog could faint or lose consciousness.

These signs include heavy panting, even at rest, and snoring when the dog is asleep. A dog that can breathe easily should not make much noise at all.


If it sounds like your dog is struggling to breath, especially when it has not been doing a lot of exercise, that is not normal and the dog should be looked at by a vet.
A dog with breathing problems may also make choking sounds when over excited, and struggle to exercise in hot weather.;
, When exercising, the dog's breathing noises may become more exaggerated and more desperate. The dog may even drool heavily, rather than take time out from breathing to swallow.This is a clear sign that your dog needs a break. It may not want to take one but it is your job to make it take a break until its breathing recovers.

, In extreme cases, the dog may not be able to get enough oxygen to oxygenate its blood. This will result in its gums and tongue turning blue. Complete collapse and loss of consciousness is not unheard of when French bulldogs are over exerted and lacking oxygen, especially in hot weather. To avoid this, try not to over exert your French bulldog on hot days or at all if you know they are already having problems breathing.
If you see these symptoms, you should take your dog to a veterinarian immediately. A veterinarian will be able to give the dog emergency oxygen.

, To understand treatment, it's helpful to understand the problem the French bulldog faces. Selective breeding for the flat face has created anatomical problems that make it difficult for these dogs to breath.


Many of these problems are due to the reduced size of the bony cavity of the nose while soft tissue structures, such as the tongue and soft palate, remain the same size. In the French bulldog's case this means his tongue and soft palate take up too much room and literally choke. Added to this, there are other anatomical problems.
The French bulldog has unnaturally narrow nostrils. This makes it difficult for it to draw air in through its nose. This is one reason why the breed pant a lot, because they need to breath through their mouth.The tongue did not shrink back at the same time the nose shortened, so a large tongue has to fit into a smaller space. This takes up room in the mouth and tends to block the back of the throat., Be aware that the French bulldog will struggle to breath more than other breeds in hot weather, as it is already panting hard just to breath.It is essential to keep the dog cool in hot weather and not exercise it in the heat of the day.


Make sure your French bulldog always has access to shade. It should never be left out in full sun. Keeping a French bulldog tied up in the sun can overheat it really quickly, even if it is not exercising.If you know the day is going to be hot, consider keeping your dog in an air conditioned space.

, When going for walks, let your dog stop and rest frequently. If its breathing becomes exaggerated, labored, or increasingly distressed, then stop immediately and cool the dog down.


You can cool an overheated dog down by giving it water to drink and by pouring water on its body. Just make sure that the water is not too cold. It shouldn't be ice cold, but instead only slightly cold so that it doesn't shock the dog's system.

, Always take plenty of water with you on walks, especially if it is warm outside. Be sure to let your dog stop and drink frequently.


Allowing the dog to drink water will help to keep the dog cool.

, A collar will restrict your dog's breathing even further, especially if it likes to pull on its leash. Instead, use a harness the does not have any contact with the dog's throat.


Make sure to get the right size harness and fit it to your dog. Follow the directions on the packaging so that the harness is neither too loose nor too tight.

, With Brachycephalic airway syndrome, the bony chamber of the nose is physically smaller but the soft palate that separates the back of the nose from the throat remains the same size. This is like having a curtain that's too long for a window in place. As the dog breathes in, the pressure change tends to suck the soft palate against the entrance to the trachea (windpipe), blocking it off.This causes the French bulldog to choke and gasp for breath.
Laryngeal saccules also affect breathing. These are tonsil like tissue located just inside the larynx (voice box). Changes in air pressure created by the anatomical changes have the effect of sucking the laryngeal saccules in the way of the trachea, and block it.
Also, a hypoplastic trachea impacts breathing. The windpipe of French bulldogs can be much narrower than a normal windpipe. This produces increased resistance to airflow and yet more breathing problems., They will be able to diagnose breathing problems and help you to decide if you're open to the idea of surgery. Assess how bad your dog's breathing is and whether you are willing to change it surgically. Some dogs struggle so hard to breath that corrective surgery is required to improve their quality of life.


It's important to discuss whether or not your dog should get surgery with your dog's veterinarian.
Unfortunately, some problems, such as the hypoplastic trachea and a large tongue, cannot be changed with surgery.

, Under general anesthesia, the vet cuts out a triangle of flesh from the outside border of the nostrils. This will create a larger gap for air to pass through.The effect of widening the nostrils makes it easier for the dog to breath through its nose.

, Under anesthesia, the surgeon assesses how much extra tissue there is at the back of the throat. He or she then trims the soft palate back.The aim is to resect (remove) enough so that there is no tissue flapping in the turbulence of the opening to the windpipe.

, The vet may opt to resect the laryngeal saccules. This surgery removes two obstructions from the crowded space at the back of the throat, allowing more space for air to pass."

Take your dog to the vet.,
X-ray the dog’s lungs.,
Get your dog a fluoroscopy.,
Ask for an endoscopy.",How to Diagnose a Collapsing Trachea in Chihuahuas2," As soon as your dog starts presenting symptoms, take him to the vet. The vet will examine your dog and look for indications of a respiratory infection, such as a raised temperature, swollen lymph nodes, or unusual noises in the lung.


Your vet will probably want to perform bloodwork and other routine tests.Other conditions may present like a collapsed trachea. Coughing is a general sign, so not every Chihuahua that coughs is going to have a collapsed trachea. Other coughs that can mimic this problem include having a long soft palate, kennel cough, heart disease, or lungworm. However, any cough should be checked out by your vet., The next step is for the vet to x-ray the dog's lungs and throat. This will rule out a lung infection as the cause for the cough.


Because of the way the collapse shows up on x-rays, the collapsed trachea may not always be visible on the x-rays., A fluoroscopy is a type of real-time x-ray, where it's possible to watch the actual movements of the trachea. However, this type of equipment is not available at every practice and referral to a specialist center may be necessary., Your vet can determine if your chihuahua has a collapsed trachea with an endoscopy of the trachea. This involves a small fiber-optic camera being passed down the windpipe while your dog is anesthetized. The operator watches the images to see if the windpipe narrows during certain phases of breathing.


However, endoscopy can cause problems in small dogs because the camera can take up most of the diameter of the windpipe and stop the dog from breathing. Thus, the operator can only study the windpipe for brief periods of time before the camera has to be withdrawn and more anesthetic gas given."

Learn what causes a collapsing trachea.,
Monitor older chihuahuas.,
Refrain from pulling on collars.",How to Diagnose a Collapsing Trachea in Chihuahuas3," The trachea, also known as the windpipe, is the tube that takes the air from mouth or nose to the lungs.When a trachea collapses, instead of the rings maintaining a totally open pipe or tube, they collapse or squash down.


When this happens, water cannot pass along and it makes it difficult for air to flow along.
The trachea can collapse because the cartilage rings are badly formed and are too wide and narrow, because the ligament filling the gap is too long and floppy, or due to a combination of both of these factors.The lining of the windpipe is very sensitive, and in a Chihuahua, this flattening can make the dog cough.
Small breeds, such as the Chihuahua, are most at risk, probably because of a genetic tendency for the rings to be malformed. Other breeds commonly affected include Yorkshire terriers, Pomeranians, Shih Tzus, Maltese terriers, toy poodles, and pugs., Collapsed tracheas can happen at any age. However, the condition generally appears around six to seven years of age.Keep an eye on your chihuahua as he ages.

, One reason dogs might end up with a collapsed trachea is from the owner pulling on the collar. Jerking the collar or using a choke chain can put enough pressure on the windpipe with force that can cause it to collapse.


Use a dog harness instead of a collar when using a leash on your dog."

Keep your Chihuahua close.,
Feed your dog.,
Groom and pet your dog.,
Train your dog.,
Play with your Chihuahua.",How to Bond with a Chihuahua1," Chihuahua’s are extremely territorial of their owners and love being around them. They like nothing more than to snuggle up in your lap and nap. Indulge your pets desire to snuggle and keep your Chihuahua close. This will only intensify your dog’s already strong bond.Consider carrying your Chihuahua in a carrier designed for small dogs.
Hold your Chihuahua in your lap and pet it while you watch TV.;
, One of the easiest ways to establish a bond with any dog is by feeding it. Establishing routine feeding times will help keep your Chihuahua’s anxiety levels down, helping it feel more comfortable with you. Feeding your dog also creates a positive association between you and your Chihuahua’s food.Avoid leaving the food in the bowl all day. Instead, give the dog its food at mealtime. You want your dog’s positive association with feedings to be with you and not the bowl.
Because Chihuahuas can develop such intense bonds with one person, make sure that you are the one feeding the dog. If someone else is feeding it, your Chihuahua may end up bonding with them.
Giving your dog a treat every now and then will also strengthen its affection towards you.

, Regularly petting and grooming your Chihuahua causes its body to release hormones that make it less anxious. This will also strengthen its bond with you. Stroke your dog’s fur while it sits in your lap. If you have a longhaired Chihuahua, give its coat a regular brushing. The more that you touch your Chihuahua, the closer its bond with you will be.Washing your Chihuahua and clipping its nails will also help strengthen your bond.
Because they tend to only bond with one person, you should groom your dog and avoid hiring someone else to do it. Your Chihuahua may react negatively to someone else.

, Training is a great way to build a bond between you and your Chihuahua. You will spend more time together. You will also give it encouragement and the occasional treat. All of these things will build a sense of teamwork and strengthen the bond between you and your dog.Rewarding your dog with treats will reinforce good behavior and create a positive association between you and treats.
Maintain an even and warm tone during training. Getting frustrated and yelling at your dog will frighten your Chihuahua and make it anxious around you.
Chihuahuas can be difficult to train. You may want to work with a trainer. However, you will need to be present and conduct much of the training to ensure that your dog bonds with you., In general, playing with your dog is one of the best ways to build a strong bond between an owner and their pet. You can play fetch, hide-and-seek, tug-of-war and other games with your dog. As you do more things that it enjoys, your Chihuahua will develop a positive association between you and having fun.Try to avoid roughhousing with your Chihuahua. They are delicate dogs that can be easily injured.
If you take your Chihuahua on a walk, only go a short distance. Chihuahuas exert their energy in short bursts and do not have the stamina for long walks.

With the many available food choices, it can be overwhelming to select which one is best for your Chihuahua. Look for a dry food that is contains approximately 30 to 33% protein.


Because a high-salt diet can contribute to kidney and heart problems in small dogs, the dog food you choose should be low in salt.Consult with your veterinarian or a respected Chihuahua breeder for additional recommendations on high-quality dry dog foods.;
, Obesity is a major problem in Chihuahuas. Your Chihuahua’s outsized personality and high energy level may lead you to feed her more than she needs, which can cause obesity.Start by feeding her the amount recommended on the bag of food, but also learn to body score your dog and monitor her weight. Check both regularly and if she is gaining weight, then decrease the amount you feed her by five to ten percent.
Because of your Chihuahua’s small size, even the occasional table scrap or treat can add a significant number of calories to her daily diet, which could lead to eventual obesity.Overfeeding can lead to other serious medical problems, such as abnormal bone development, skin problems, arthritis, heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes.
How much you feed your Chihuahua can depend on several factors, such as age, activity level and specific medical needs. Talk with your veterinarian if you are unsure about how much to feed your Chihuahua.

, Do not feed your Chihuahua human food, particularly table scraps.Specific human foods to avoid include cured meats (e.g., bacon, ham), milk products, chocolate, grapes, and onions.Milk products can cause diarrhea in dogs.Grapes are toxic to dogs and cause kidney failure.Onions can cause damage to red blood cells in dogs. Chocolate is also toxic to dogs, and cause such signs as diarrhea, hyperactivity, and tremors., Since your Chihuahua has a small stomach, he will not be able to eat large quantities at a time. Multiple daily feedings are recommended. Extremely small Chihuahuas (less than three pounds) may need to be fed as frequently as every four hours.Larger Chihuahuas can be fed two to three times a day.How often you feed your dog will also depend on his age, activity level, and medical needs.
Try different feeding schedules to determine what works best for you and your Chihuahua.
Rather than feeding your Chihuahua at exactly the same time each day, feed him within a general time range. This can prevent your Chihuahua from becoming too demanding at meal time.
Allow your Chihuahua about 15 to 20 minutes to eat, and keep other away during meal time — your Chihuahua should not feel like he has to defend his food.

, Your Chihuahua may exhibit physical signs of dietary-related problems. An obvious physical indicator is obesity. Rather than having an ideal body condition (e.g., visible waist, slightly visible ribs, a upward tummy tuck from his chest to his hind end), obesity will cause him to look plump.


Oily, flaky, or dry skin is also indicative of dietary problems.
If your Chihuahua has dull coat or dull-looking eyes, he may have some dietary insufficiencies.
Abnormal feces (diarrhea, very hard feces) can indicate dietary problems.
If you suspect your Chihuahua is suffering from dietary-related problems, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian to discuss potential dietary changes.

, Chihuahuas have either smooth coats or long coats. The smooth coat is velvety, shiny, and fits close to a Chihuahua’s body.Long coats are flat to slightly curly, with feathering on the legs and a plumed tail.Chihuahuas with either coat type will shed (usually during the spring and fall), but the shedding is quite manageable.If you have smooth-coated Chihuahua, brush her once a week with either a rubber grooming glove or soft-bristled brush.The bristles should be made of natural material.Long-coated Chihuahuas usually need more frequent brushing — at least one to two times a week, but daily is ideal.Use a pin brush.Use a fine-toothed flea comb to remove dead and loose hair.A stainless steel comb is helpful to remove tangled hair.You can purchase grooming materials at your local pet store.

, With regular brushing, you will not need to bathe your Chihuahua frequently. A bath once every one to two months is usually adequate, unless he has gotten into something particularly smelly.Use only dog-safe shampoo. Human shampoo could strip your Chihuahua’s skin of essential oils.
Bathe your Chihuahua in lukewarm water.When you have finished bathing your Chihuahua, do not let him air dry.Because of their small size, Chihuahuas can lose body heat and become cold very quickly. Use a towel to dry your Chihuahua off promptly and completely after a bath.

, Your Chihuahua’s eyes may occasionally have discharge around them.Gently wipe the area around her eyes with a soft cloth to remove the discharge. Some Chihuahuas can also develop tear stains around their eyes.Tear stain removers are available at your local pet store.

, Chihuahua ears are prone to getting dirty. To clean your Chihuahua’s ears, place a small amount of dog-specific ear cleaning solution on a cotton ball. Gently wipe his ears with the cotton ball, but do not clean so far down into his ears that you cannot see the cotton ball — clean only as deep as your first knuckle.Clean his ears if they smell or if you can see wax.Do not use a cotton swab to clean your Chihuahua’s ears — it could push wax, dirt, etc. down further into his ears.You can apply a small amount of baby or coconut oil to the edges of your Chihuahua’s ears if they look dry.Your veterinarian can recommend a good ear cleaning solution.

, Chihuahua nails tend to grow quickly,so it is important to trim your Chihuahua’s nails regularly. Trimming her nails once every few weeks should be sufficient to keep her nails from growing so long that they click on the floor.If you are uncomfortable trimming your Chihuahua’s nails on your own, consider taking her to a groomer or your veterinarian to have this done.

, Small breed dogs, such as Chihuahuas, tend to have dental problems.Regular dental care is therefore necessary to maintain dental health. If possible, you should brush your Chihuahua’s teeth several times a week.It is ideal to start brushing your Chihuahua’s teeth when he is puppy, so that he is comfortable with the process.An older Chihuahua would probably be more resistant to having his teeth brushed.
Make sure to use only a dog-specific toothbrush and toothpaste.If you are uncomfortable brushing your dog’s teeth, your veterinarian can do so. However, a veterinary dental cleaning requires that your dog be anesthetized, and can thus be very expensive.
Your Chihuahua’s small mouth does not give his teeth room to develop properly. He may need to have several teeth removed by your veterinarian to leave more room for the remaining teeth to develop properly., Grooming is the perfect time to check your Chihuahua’s body for any abnormalities, such as lumps, bumps, or signs of inflammation (e.g., redness, swelling).If you notice any abnormalities, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian for a thorough physical examination and medical workup.


Regularly checking your Chihuahua’s body can help you detect problems early, when they could be easily treated., Chihuahuas are very energetic animals. If you have an adult Chihuahua, you may be surprised at just how much energy she has to run and play.It is important to recognize, though, that Chihuahuas expend their energy in short bursts, rather than in sustained exercise.Short walks are a good form of exercise for your Chihuahua.Chihuahuas are prone to tracheal collapse, so use a harness instead of a traditional leash to walk her.Over exercising your Chihuahua could injure her.End the exercise session before she tires herself out.

, Frequent play sessions are another good way to exercise your Chihuahua. Chihuahuas love to play fetch, so you can play fetch with your Chihuahua during play sessions.If you have a fenced-in backyard, you can let your Chihuahua outside to chase squirrels.Schedule as many play sessions as you can reasonably manage. Try to play with him at the same time each day.
Limit your Chihuahua’s outdoor play when it is hot outside.If you do take him outside to play, keep a bowl of fresh, cold water nearby to prevent him from getting dehydrated.Supervise your Chihuahua if he is playing outside. His small size makes him easy prey for hawks and other birds of prey.In addition, Chihuahuas are very curious — his curiosity may lead him to escape, if given the chance., Letting your Chihuahua run and play in a dog park is not only great exercise, but also allows her to interact with other dogs.Make sure your Chihuahua is already well socialized before taking her to a dog park. If she is not accustomed to being around other dogs, your Chihuahua may be unfriendly, and or even aggressive, towards other dogs.


Chihuahuas forget how small they are, and will stand up to a larger dog if given the chance., If you have a puppy Chihuahua, enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class will teach him the basics of proper interactions with other dogs. Since Chihuahuas can be very unfriendly towards other dogs,exposing your Chihuahua to different dogs when he is a puppy will allow him to be more comfortable and friendly around other dogs when he gets older.

, Obedience classes are suitable once your Chihuahua is no longer a puppy, and can teach him how to become a well-behaved adult dog. These classes will teach him how to follow basic commands (e.g., ""sit,"" ""stay""), and will help him become more comfortable interacting with other dogs and people.Chihuahuas are very intelligent, and are fast learners.Chihuahuas can also be willful at times, so you will need to be patient yet firm with your Chihuahua as you train him.If obedience classes are not a practical option for you, you can teach him how to sit, stay, come when called, and lie down on your own. You can also leash train your Chihuahua.

, As with other forms of training, housetraining your Chihuahua is relatively easy. Take her outside frequently and regularly so that she will learn not to go to the bathroom in the house.For example, puppy Chihuahuas should be let outside after eating, after playtime, after naps, and before bedtime.If your Chihuahua goes to the bathroom in your house, clean up with the mess without fanfare. Rubbing her nose in her waste, or otherwise verbally or physically punishing your Chihuahua, will not teach her not to go to the bathroom in the house. Rather, she may begin to fear you., If not well trained, your Chihuahua could turn into a tiny terror.In addition to obedience classes, establishing ground rules in your house is necessary to prevent your Chihuahua from becoming an unruly tyrant.For example, you can establish ground rules about where your Chihuahua can sleep and how he should wait to be fed.


A Chihuahua with no ground rules can become overindulged and very demanding,with no desire or incentive to behave properly.

, Proper socialization is essential to caring for your Chihuahua. You should socialize your Chihuahua when she is young — the younger you socialize her, the more likely she will grow up to be a well-rounded adult dog. Although she will learn socialization skills through puppy kindergarten and obedience class, you can also socialize your Chihuahua on your own by exposing her to new people, sights, and sounds.


Chihuahuas tend to be wary around strangers. When you introduce her to new people, allow her to initiate the interaction — this will decrease the likelihood that she will become fearful of new people.When introducing your Chihuahua to a child, the child should not pet her or give her treats initially. Let your Chihuahua approach and become comfortable with the child first, then allow the child to gently pet her and give her treats.Unfamiliar objects can be frightening for your Chihuahua. When socializing your Chihuahua to new objects in her environment, begin by staying far enough away so that she feels safe yet remains curious. Slowly move closer as she feels more comfortable., Chihuahuas, as with other dog breeds, are prone to various health issues. Patellar luxation, in which the patella (kneecap) slips out of place, is a common orthopedic problem in very small dogs.Sometimes, the patella will slip back into place on its own. In severe cases, though, surgery is necessary to reposition the patella.Patellar luxation can be caused by jumping on and off furniture.Establish a ground rule that your Chihuahua cannot jump on and off your furniture.
Physical signs of patellar luxation include pain, lameness, and ""bunny hopping"" when running., Chihuahuas can be prone to developing a neurologic disease called hydrocephalus, a congenital defect in which cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the brain and places pressure on the brain.If your Chihuahua has hydrocephalus, her head will appear swollen. There is no cure for hydrocephalus, but the pressure can be reduced with steroids and a surgical shunt to move fluid from the brain to the abdomen.An open fontanelle is another neurologic issue in Chihuahuas. It is caused when the bony plates of the skull do not completely fuse together. The result is a soft spot on the top of head.Your Chihuahua can live a normal life with an open fontanelle, but you will have to be extremely careful when playing with her. Rough play can increase the risk of head injury, which could be fatal if your Chihuahua has an open fontanelle., Chihuahuas can be prone to several heart and respiratory problems. For example, Chihuahuas can develop heart murmurs,which would be diagnosed by your veterinarian. Heart murmurs vary in severity, but can sometimes be managed through changes to eating and exercise habits.Chihuahuas can be genetically predisposed to tracheal collapse, in which the tracheal rings lose their stiffness.Traditional choke collars can cause tracheal collapse in small dogs.If your Chihuahua tires easily, or has trouble breathing, he may have a problem with his heart or respiratory system. Take him to your veterinarian for a full medical workup.

, Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, can be a problem in small dogs like Chihuahuas. Signs of hypoglycemia include slow movements, listlessness, trembling, and shivering.Severe hypoglycemia can lead to convulsions, a coma, and possibly death.If your Chihuahua is exhibiting signs of hypoglycemia, you can rub unprocessed honey either under her tongue or on her gums as a first aid measure.Take your Chihuahua to your veterinarian immediately if she is hypoglycemic."

Keep things relaxed.,
Let your new Chihuahua explore.,
Be careful when socializing your Chihuahua.,
Begin your Chihuahua’s routine.",How to Bond with a Chihuahua2," Whether you are bringing home a puppy or a rescue dog, the first thing you will need to do is create a safe space for your Chihuahua. The new dog will be very anxious about its new environment. You can make its transition smoother by keeping your home quiet and relaxed. Once your Chihuahua has settled in, you can begin building a bond between the two of you.Initially, keep your new Chihuahua away from any other pets you may have.
Ask your family members or roommates to be quite while the new dog adjusts.

, Once your dog has settled in, let it investigate its new surroundings. Your new Chihuahua will want to explore and familiarize itself with its new home. By allowing your new dog to explore, you are helping it feel more relaxed and safe in your home. This is particularly important for Chihuahuas who tend to prefer indoor staying indoors. Through exploration, your dog will relax and get to know your scents, facilitating the bonding process. Do not leave the dog locked up in a room. This will increase its anxiety and make it more fearful of you, limiting your ability to bond with it.

, If you have family members or other dogs, you will want to be very careful when it comes to socializing your Chihuahua. Because they form such intense bonds with only one of their owners, Chihuahuas are territorial and aggressive towards anyone or anything that is not that person. Initially, you will want to limit your new dog’s interaction with your family and any other dogs.Socializing a young Chihuahua will help it be less territorial. However, an adopted or rescue dog may not have been properly socialized and have behavioral problems.
A Chihuahua’s territorial nature can be extremely problematic around other dogs. Chihuahuas often pick fights with much bigger dogs and, because of their small frame, they tend to get badly injured.
Unfortunately, because Chihuahuas are so territorial of their owner, your dog may never be friendly to your family members or any other dogs. Be sure to consider this before bringing home a Chihuahua.

, It is important that you start your dog’s feeding and exercise routine immediately. This will help it relax and acclimate to its new home. Feeding and play are also two of the main ways in which you can build your relationship with your dog. By starting a feeding and play routine immediately, you are getting on the fast track to bonding with your Chihuahua.Establishing a regular feeding routine is particularly important since this is the best way to bond with your Chihuahua.

"
"
Establish your alpha status.,
Speak in a calm tone.,
Use positive reinforcement.",How to Bond with a Chihuahua3," Be sure to establish that you are the alpha in the pack. Dogs are pack animals and feel secure when they understand the household’s hierarchy. In order to create a healthy bonding situation between you and your dog, you will need to establish the proper hierarchy between you and your dog.


Demonstrate to your dog that you control its food. If your Chihuahua is being possessive of its food, take away its bowl and then return it later. This will demonstrate that you are in charge.
When you walk your dog, you should also make sure that you do not let the dog lead or tug on the leash. Instead, you should lead the dog or allow it to walk beside you.

, When you interact with your Chihuahua, stay calm and speak to them in a warm and positive manner. Remember that dogs cannot understand the words you say. However, they do understand your tone and speaking with a friendly tone will increase their affinity towards you.Remember to keep a calm and warm tone even if your dog misbehaves. Yelling at your dog will only make it fearful of you.

, Rewarding your dog for good behavior is a great way to build the bond between you and your Chihuahua. By giving your dog praise and a treat when it does well, your dog will develop a positive association between you and getting a reward. This will also help you properly train your dog."

Have your Boxer treated if he has a relapse.",How to Treat Lymphoma in Boxers," Lymph nodes are located throughout your Boxer’s body and are part of his lymphatic system, which also has vessels that transport infection-fighting substances. Lymph nodes are the most common sites for lymphoma.Some lymph nodes are easier to find than others. Lymph nodes below your Boxer’s jaw and behind his knees will be easily visible when enlarged.Lymphoma can spread to multiple lymph nodes very rapidly.;
, Lymph nodes affected with lymphoma will feel hard and rubbery. They will not be painful, though., The lymphatic system’s vessels help keep lymphatic fluid moving throughout your Boxer’s body. With enlarged lymph nodes, this fluid builds up in different places. If your Boxer has swollen lymph nodes in his legs, fluid will accumulate near his ankles. Swollen lymph nodes near his face could cause his face to look puffy from fluid buildup., Part of your Boxer’s immune system is located in his gastrointestinal (GI) tract. If he has GI lymphoma, he will show signs of digestive upset, including vomiting and watery diarrhea.Your Boxer will also have a reduced appetite, which could lead to weight loss.GI lymphoma makes up less than 10% of all canine lymphomas., One type of lymphoma, called cutaneous lymphoma, can develop on the skin and in the mouth. If your Boxer has cutaneous lymphoma, his skin will initially have patches that are dry, red, itchy, and flaky. His skin can then become ulcerated and thick. In the mouth, cutaneous lymphoma can cause red gums and ulcerations in the roof of the mouth.Healthy, noncancerous gums are pink.

, Lymphoma can also form in the thymus, which is a gland located beneath your Boxer’s sternum. If this gland becomes enlarged, fluid can accumulate in his chest, making breathing difficult.He may start breathing more heavily.

, Your vet will confirm a lymphoma diagnosis. To make the diagnosis, they will physically examine your Boxer and perform some diagnostic tests. During the appointment, give your vet a detailed history of your Boxer’s overall health and what lymphoma symptoms you have noticed. The more information you can provide, the better your vet will be able to make a diagnosis.Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of an enlarged lymph node is a quick, painless, and inexpensive way to diagnose lymphoma. A long, thin needle is used to take a sample of cells. If your vet thinks the lymphoma has spread, they may perform ultrasound-guided FNAs of some internal organs (e.g., intestines, bone marrow).A biopsy is the ‘gold standard’ for diagnosing lymphoma, since it provides more accurate information than an FNA about the cancer.Your vet will determine whether to do an FNA or a biopsy.
Other diagnostic tests include bloodwork, urinalysis, chest x-rays, and abdominal ultrasound. These tests will help your vet determine where the lymphoma has spread to in your Boxer’s body., In most cases, canine lymphoma is not curable. The main goal of lymphoma treatment is remission: the temporary disappearance of cancer symptoms.The treatment plan your vet devises will reduce your Boxer’s tumor burden and improve his quality of life, but will probably not cure him.


Dogs in remission can live very happy lives, so do not be discouraged over the lack of a cure for your Boxer’s lymphoma.

, Even if your Boxer’s lymph nodes are really large, he may not feel or look that sick when his lymphoma is diagnosed. Do not wait until he looks sick to start treatment, though! Without prompt treatment, the lymphoma could spread rapidly, decreasing the chances of remission and survival., Systemic chemotherapy is the preferred treatment for lymphoma. A combination of chemotherapy drugs is usually given at the same time.Your vet will determine which set of chemotherapy drugs to give your Boxer, and how often to give them.


Doxorubicin is a chemotherapy drug used to treat lymphoma. Between 70 and 90% of dogs treated for lymphoma with a doxorubicin-based treatment plan achieve remission.Most dogs tolerate chemotherapy very well, so your Boxer will probably not suffer serious side effects during treatment.Serious side effects, which occur in only about 5% of canine lymphoma cases, include diarrhea, vomiting, extreme tiredness, and changes in urination (e.g., blood in urine).Tell your vet about any negative side effects your Boxer experiences.

, Surgery and radiation therapy are sometimes used with chemotherapy to treat lymphoma in Boxers. For example, surgery may be effective in removing GI lymphoma. However, if your Boxer has GI lymphoma that has spread throughout the GI tract, he is likely very ill and would not gain much benefit from treatment.Surgery or radiation therapy, when combined with chemotherapy, can be effective if your Boxer has only a single lymphoma.Prednisone, which is a steroid, can treat lymphoma by killing cancer cells. It is inexpensive and can be given by mouth.Discuss these other treatment options with your vet.

, If your Boxer has fluid accumulation, your vet will need to drain that fluid as part of the treatment plan.They will use specialized equipment to remove the fluid from your Boxer’s body. Fluid removal may help your Boxer breathe a little easier and feel more comfortable overall.

, Chemotherapy could make your Boxer more susceptible to developing infections. Common signs of infection include digestive upset (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite), weakness, tiredness, and fever.Take your Boxer to your vet for treatment if he develops an infection.

, Lymphoma treatment is long term. Your vet may want to see your Boxer as often as once a month to monitor his treatment progress.Even if the appointments are not monthly, regular veterinary visits will be important to keep your Boxer as healthy as possible during treatment.

, When your Boxer enters remission, his lymphoma will be reduced, but not completely gone. If he is in complete remission, there will not be any detectable cancer. If he is in partial remission, his tumor burden will be detectable, but reduced by about at least 50%.Your vet will perform different tests to detect the cancer.
How long your Boxer stays in remission depends on different factors, such as the primary site of the lymphoma and how far it has spread., With complete remission, your Boxer will probably be feeling pretty good. He’ll probably want to eat, run, and play like he used to.Your Boxer may not be quite so lively if he’s in partial remission, but will definitely be feeling better.


Take notice if your Boxer starts looking unwell, or if his lymph nodes start swelling up again. These signs could indicate a relapse, meaning the lymphoma has come back.

, More than likely, your Boxer will have a treatment relapse. Your vet will need to treat him with chemotherapy again. Be mindful, though, that the tumor cells will become more resistant to chemotherapy with each relapse.When your Boxer’s lymphoma no longer responds to chemotherapy, your vet will adjust the treatment plan and focus more on keeping him comfortable.

Take your dog to the veterinarian before she becomes pregnant.,
Make sure your dog is getting the right kind of nutrition.,
Prepare for the due date.,
Have your veterinarian take x-rays of the puppies.,
Set up a nesting area.,
Arrange for homes for the puppies.,
Buy puppy formula ahead of time.,
Isolate the mother three weeks before expected delivery.,
Prepare for the actual delivery.,
Know when your dog is able to conceive.,
Know the signs of pregnancy.,
Be careful of giving your pregnant dog medication or vaccines.",How to Care for a Pregnant Chihuahua," If you expect to breed your dog, take her to the vet beforehand.If your dog becomes pregnant unexpectedly, take her as soon as you become aware of it.


If you plan to breed your dog, it’s recommended that you wait until she’s at least 24 months old, which will allow the dog to fully mature so any medical problems that may affect a pregnancy will become apparent.
Small dog breeds may have genetic conditions that are important to be aware of before breeding, including dental problems, dislocating patellas, hip dysplasia, spine problems, allergies, heart conditions, and/or behavioral problems. If your dog has these problems, do not breed her.
Make sure that your dog is up to date on vaccines. Her antibodies will be passed on to the puppies through her milk and will help protect the puppies from getting sick.
Make sure that your dog is on a deworming program. Roundworms, hookworms, heartworms and others can be passed from a mother to her puppies.;
, Your vet can offer recommendations as to the best food for her during her pregnancy. If your pregnant dog is not obese, your vet may recommend feeding her puppy food in the latter weeks of her pregnancy.


The higher calories in puppy food will help the mother pass on additional nutrition to her growing puppies.
Avoid supplements such as calcium unless your veterinarian prescribes them. Milk fever, or eclampsia, is common for small breed dogs a few weeks after giving birth, and it’s more likely to occur with over supplementation of calcium during pregnancy.

, The average gestation period for a dog is between 58 and 68 days. Calculate the dog's expected due date based on the date of conception, so that you'll be prepared when the time for labor comes.


Your pregnant chihuahua is likely to display nesting behaviors and may withdraw from people in the final weeks of her pregnancy. This is normal.

, At 45 days of pregnancy, the vet will be able to count the number of puppies in the litter using x-rays.


Since a Chihuahua is a small breed dog, 3 or 4 puppies in a litter is plenty. However, if only one or two are seen, that may pose problems at the time of birth. Fewer puppies mean the puppies will be larger and may be too big to pass through the birth canal naturally, so a planned C-section would be best.
Though a planned C-section will be more costly, it will still be cheaper than an emergency C-section, so plan ahead.

, About a week before your dog is due to begin labor, find a quiet area where your chihuahua will be able to give birth in peace. A cozy box or dry paddling pool in a calm and quiet area should do the trick; add old towels or blankets for comfort, and make sure they're clean.

, As soon as you know your dog’s pregnant, whether it was planned or not, begin arranging for homes for the puppies.


If you aren’t able to find homes for all of the puppies, be prepared to keep them yourself until you can find them a home. Thousands of dogs end up in over-crowded shelters because irresponsible owners breed their dogs without providing homes for the puppies. Don’t be part of the problem.
Prepare to live with puppies for a minimum of 8 weeks before they leave your house for new homes. In certain states like California, it’s illegal to adopt out a puppy younger than 8 weeks of age.
To ensure the puppies go to good homes, have an application process and ask questions of the interested parties. It’s also recommended that you charge a modest amount for each puppy to ensure the interested parties are serious about and committed to adopting the puppy.

, Newborn puppies will need to be fed every 2-4 hours around the clock, and if a puppy has trouble nursing, you want to have formula on hand to feed it.


You can buy puppy formula at most pet supply stores.

, To protect the mother and her puppies from contracting illness or disease like canine herpes, confine her away from all other dogs in the three weeks leading up to her expected delivery date.It’s also highly advisable to keep the mother away from other dogs for three weeks following the delivery.

, When the time comes, help your chihuahua through their labor. You can find a detailed guide specifically on labour at How to Help Your Chihuahua During Labor.

, Your dog is able to conceive as soon as she enters her first heat cycle, which can be as young as 4 to 7 months old.When your dog is in heat, she will attract male dogs and may even actively seek them out. Other dogs can detect the scent of a female dog in heat from miles away; thus it’s extremely important that you keep very close watch on a dog in heat and confine her indoors at all times to avoid unwanted pregnancy.
A Chihuahua may conceive even if you think you intervened before copulation was completed.
A Chihuahua can be impregnated by a much larger dog (or dogs), in which case pregnancy and labor can become increasingly risky. Avoid this situation as far as possible. Ideally, the female should be larger than the impregnating male. If your dog is impregnated by a larger dog, seek your veterinarian’s advice.

, A dog will begin to show key symptoms that can help you determine if she’s likely pregnant, including:Lethargy
Reduced appetite or vomiting
Rapidly enlarging stomach that feels firm (the stomach will be visibly swollen by 15-30 days into the pregnancy)
Nipples will enlarge and protrude
Note that while some reduced appetite and/or nausea is normal, it should resolve itself within about a week. If it lasts longer than that or occurs along with listlessness, it could be a sign of something more serious and you should bring your dog to the vet., Unless directly instructed by your vet, you should not give your dog medications unsafe for pregnancy, and you shouldn’t have her vaccinated.Ideally, your dog should have been vaccinated before she became pregnant. But if not, don’t vaccinate her while pregnant, as some vaccines can be harmful to developing fetuses.
If using flea control, be sure to use a product that’s safe for use on pregnant dogs.

Research the breed.,
Recognize how people often behave around small dogs.,
Understand dog pack hierarchy.,
Socialize your Chihuahua.,
Walk the dog!,
Train your Chihuahua.,
Toughen up.,
Teach others.",How to Prevent Your Chihuahua from Behaving Badly," The American Kennel Club (AKC) describes the breed as ""alert, projecting the ‘terrier-like’ attitudes of self importance, confidence, self-reliance."" Though these traits can look cute when coupled with a five-pound dog, Chihuahuas have a tendency to become dominant and controlling if they aren't provided with a strong pack leader - and though Chihuahuas are naturally affectionate and loyal, their mischievous side can lead them to exhibit bad behavior. Unfortunately, because of the increase in popularity Chihuahuas have been receiving, more ""backyard breeders"" have started breeding low-quality Chihuahuas with poor tendencies of being extremely shy or vicious. Always purchase a Chihuahua from a responsible, high-quality breeder, or adopt one from a reliable shelter.;
, People tend to have completely different approaches to behavior from small and large dogs, and this can lead to accidentally reinforcing bad behavior from Chihuahuas. If a German Shepherd growled at a dog in the dog park, for example, the dog would be immediately corrected. If a Chihuahua did the same, people might remark on how cute it is that the Chi thinks he's a larger dog than he really is, or the owner might even scoop him up to ""protect"" him. Avoid making the mistake of treating a Chihuahua like a baby, instead of a dog - correct your Chihuahua if he behaves badly.

, Dogs retain instincts such as the instinct to live within a pack with definite rules and a leader. Domesticated dogs replace the pack with their human family, and expect the alpha of the pack to take control. If your dog believes that you're weak or unable to protect the pack, he'll take over for you! Because we're a different species, it can be hard to distinguish what behaviors count as weak and our desire to see behaviors differently from what they really mean can hamper our ability to properly control our canine companions.


As an example, imagine a dog begging at the table. The dog paws at his owner's leg, staring pleadingly up at his owner. He jumps up so that his paws are on the owner's knee and makes eye contact. The owner, whether seeking to spoil or humanize the dog or from feeling guilty or exasperated, throws the dog a piece of beef. From the dog's point of view, he just invaded the owner's personal space by pawing and jumping at the owner's leg, which is a dominance signal, made strong eye contact, which is a dominance signal, and forced the owner into submission (the owner gave him food). The dog may now regard the owner as weak.

, Socialization is about introducing your dog to various parts of life - taking your dog to a park, introducing him to a young child, and so on. Socialization is extremely important for puppies, and it doesn't stop there - adult Chihuahuas should be provided with new sights and sounds as well. If your Chihuahua is scared by something, resist the urge to comfort and cuddle him; instead, gently but firmly require that your Chihuahua face his fear, whether he's walking on a slippery floor or being pet by a stranger.

, Though Chihuahuas generally do provide for their exercise needs through play and activity around the house, always take your Chihuahua on a daily walk. Not only does this provide extra exercise (which is helpful, since Chihuahuas can get chubby easily), it stimulates his mind, socializes him, and if done correctly, reinforces your status as alpha. Your Chi should be in the heel position whenever being walked. In packs, alpha dogs lead the way, and your Chi will see being allowed to walk in front of you yet another sign of your inadequacy as pack leader. The same goes when passing through doorways: go first, and have your Chi follow.

, Chihuahuas are highly intelligent dogs (if somewhat stubborn), and training is recommended to stimulate their mind, increase your bond, and to keep them out of mischief. Using a positive reinforcement system that requires your dog to think for himself - such as clicker training - is your best bet. Start with simple tricks such as sit, down, stay, come, and heel, and then the sky's the limit - try crate training your dog, or training it to jump on his hind legs!

, Chihuahuas are experts at puppy-dog looks, but sometimes it's important to put your foot down and say no. Though you should always treat your Chihuahua well, sometimes you have to skip the extra treat and give your Chi a bath, even if he really doesn't want one. Learn how to be assertive, and know when enough's enough.

, Spread your new-found Chihuahua knowledge around - by doing anything from teaching a young girl that Chihuahuas aren't toys to training your Chihuahua to compete in a dog sport, you'll spread love and respect for this wonderful breed. Most of all, help people learn that Chihuahuas are not vapid accessories for celebrities and fashionistas but are actually wonderfully intelligent little canine beings.

Teach your dog the strength of his bite.,
Play with your puppy.,
React when your puppy bites hard.,
Take your hand away.,
Keep repeating the process.,
Praise him for biting appropriately.",How to Stop a Boxer Dog from Biting1," Bite inhibition is what a dog learns about how strong his bite is. Basically, when playing with other dogs, your dog can learn to not bite hard enough to harm another dog. Your dog can learn to do the same with humans, as humans can take even less force than other dogs.It's important to teach the pup to not bite hard first, so that if your pup ever does decide to bite out of the blue, it's less likely to break skin or cause a serious injury.;
, The first step in this training is to start playing with your pup. Let him mouth on your hand, though not hard., When your puppy actually chomps down on your skin, you need to react. Make a noise like a yelp, or yell ""Ow!"" Your pup should jump back at your reaction. If your reaction doesn't work, try a different sound., First, let your hand relax, and then take your hand back. You want to teach your pup that hard biting stops the fun of play.However, don't jerk back, as that could make him think you're playing; he may bite again., Wait a bit to start play again. Once you begin again, repeat the process if your pup bites hard again. Repeat as many times as your pup needs to get the picture., When your dog is biting at the right pressure in play, say ""Good dog,"" using a happy tone of voice. That reinforces that the right pressure is soft."
"
Pay attention to stiffness in your dog.,
Look for the symptoms in older dogs.,
Take signs of discomfort seriously.,
Take your dog to the veterinarian.,
Discuss the disease with your veterinarian.,
Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for treatment.,
Learn about how the spine works and how spondylosis deformans can affect it.",How to Diagnose Spondylosis Deformans in Boxers," Is your dog less agile than is used to be? If your dog has a less mobility and is reluctant to move, it may be due to this disease. This is because the spine has become fused with bone, making the dog more stiff and less flexible than it was in earlier life.Happily, it rarely produces symptoms other than stiffness and is most often detected when the dog is x-rayed for another reason.;
, This is a condition that arises as a result of the ageing process.Because of this, it is not a disease to look for in younger dogs.


Older dogs often have a variety of mobility issues, stemming from a wide array of issues related to aging. So, if your dog is having trouble moving, it could be caused by spondylosis deformans or by another disease, such as arthritis.

, Occasionally the bony bridges of spondylosis deformans can pinch the spinal nerves as they leave the spinal cord and exit between the vertebra.If this is the case, the dog may yelp, whine, or shows signs of discomfort when it moves in a certain way.


If the disease has progressed to this stage it has become a quality of life issue and needs to be addressed with veterinary care.

, Any dog that is lame or shows signs of discomfort, such as restlessness, whining, or even out-of-character aggression, should be checked by a vet. This will allow the vet to find the source of the pain and to treat it.


Your veterinarian will have to rule out many possible causes for stiffness and discomfort, spondylosis deformans is just one of them.For example, older dogs often have arthritis and may be lame or stiff for this reason. This is where confusion comes in because it can be difficult to know how much a dog's lack of mobility is due to arthritis in the hips or elbows, and how much is because of spondylosis deformans.

, If the condition was found incidentally, for instance because you Boxer was getting x-rays for another reason, then the condition may have no impact on your dog. Discuss how advanced the spinal growths are and what, if any, impact it will have on your dog's movement.It is good to know about the condition before it impacts your dog's health. If you know you should be on the look out for discomfort and stiffness, it will allow you to get further veterinary help right when these symptoms appear.

, In most cases, the only treatment given for this condition is to address symptoms of pain or discomfort. If the dog is in discomfort, then pain relief, such as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, may be prescribed.


If the pain seems to be neurological in origin (such as pinched nerve roots) then gabapentin may be prescribed, as this is more effective at treating nerve-induced discomfort.
While surgery is usually not an option, the process of laying down extra bone to stabilize the spine or removing the bony growths has been argued to be beneficial in extreme cases.However, dogs with this condition tend to be old and may not recover as well from surgery as a younger dog would.

, This will allow you to better understand your dog's condition. The spinal cord is made up of multiple independent small bones, called vertebrae, which are arranged end to end and joined by ligaments and tendons. Between each vertebra is a cushion like disc, which allows the spine to bend and flex, while maintaining its rod-like shape.What's thought to happen with spondylosis deformans is that as the discs slowly degenerate, extra bone is produced by the vertebra in order to bridge the gap and stabilize the spinal cord. The bridge forms between neighboring vertebrae, but as many bridges can form as necessary to stabilize the spine.It is common to find areas of the spine affected, rather than the whole vertebrae. Common areas include the junction between the end of the thoracic (chest) spine and the beginning of the lumbar (abdomen) vertebra, or another common site is the end of the lumbar (abdomen) vertebra and the sacrum (the fused vertebrae that are attached to the pelvis)."

Trade skin for chew toys.,
Try skin-safe deterrent.,
Keep him distracted.,
Keep him engaged.",How to Stop a Boxer Dog from Biting2," When your dog starts biting, give him a chew toy instead. That teaches your dog that his teeth belong on the toy, not you.While you want to train your pup not to bite hard, you do eventually want to teach him not to bite at at all, which is where these steps can help.

, Most pet stores sell deterrents that your dog will not like the taste of, such as bitter apple. When you're playing, try putting the deterrent on your skin. Once the dog tastes it a few times, he'll likely want to stay away from human skin., Boxers are high-energy dogs that need a great deal of play. Try very active games such as fetch. These games will help your dog release energy, and at the same time, move him away from biting games., Boxers need to have lots of entertainment. Provide enough toys so that he doesn't get bored; when he's bored, he may lash out or bite. Try rotating them out so that when he gets bored with the first couple, you'll have more on hand to pique his interest."

Begin by getting your boxer spayed or neutered.,
Let your boxer socialize with dogs and people.,
Keep stress under control.,
Give time-outs for biting.,
Know when to back off.,
Try professional help.",How to Stop a Boxer Dog from Biting3," This step may not seem intuitive to most new boxer owners. However, this step generally makes dogs less aggressive, so it should be your first step when trying to teach your dog not to bite., Boxers are highly social animals, and they enjoy being around other dogs, especially boxers.Dogs teach other dogs how much biting is appropriate; when a dog stops playing and bites too hard, that dog is ostracized for a bit.In addition, try letting your dog get to know other people. The more people your dog knows, the calmer he'll be when he meets new people.Therefore, try taking your dog out to socialize. A dog park is a good place to provide socialization.

, Boxers usually bite when they are stressed or frightened. If you know a particular situation is going to stress your boxer out, don't take him. For instance, if he's not used to social situations, don't take him to a big crowd on his first outing. Work up to crowds gradually. Though your dog may be able to work up to these situations when properly trained, when he's first starting out, try to keep his stress down., When your dog bites, yelp and walk away. Go to another room if possible. Stay away for at least a minute. That teaches the dog that this type of behavior results in the end of your attention., If your dog is too aggressive and has a history of biting, use a muzzle to keep people safe and to seek professional help at the earliest possible time. Some signs that the dog is behaving aggressively and more likely to bite are:


Protecting toys or food
Weight forward, head lowered, raised lips, ears back, direct stare

, Contact a dog trainer or animal behaviorist in your area. These professionals can help you get your dog under control. They may be able to see the key to why your dog is biting when you can't because they know more about dog behavior than you do; they can read a dog's body language without anthropomorphizing it, meaning they won't interpret dog behavior through the lens of human body language."

Common locations for mast cell tumors are the abdomen, upper thigh, and chest.;
, Mast cell tumors often vary in size and appearance. They can look red and swollen with ulcers.Or, they might look like harmless bumps, with no signs of inflammation (e.g., redness, swelling).Mast cell tumors are known for changing in size—if you notice a bump is big one day and small the next, it may be a mast cell tumor.Mast cell have granules containing substances that control allergic reactions and inflammation. A mast cell tumor changes in size based on what substance is released from those granules.Mast cell tumors can feel soft or solid to the touch.However, simply touching the mass cell tumor can trigger a reaction and change in appearance., Mast cells are located throughout the body, including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.If cancerous mast cells have spread to your Boxer’s GI tract, he may show signs of digestive upset:Decreased appetite
Vomiting, which may be bloody
Black or dark feces
Abdominal pain (indicated by a hunched posture)
Mast cell tumors can cause stomach and intestinal ulcerations.If you see blood in your Boxer’s vomit or feces, it’s probably due to these ulcerations.

, In addition to the skin and GI tract, mast cells can be found in the respiratory tract.Mast cell tumors in your Boxer’s respiratory system can cause coughing and difficulty breathing., Mast cell tumors can make wound healing take longer. If your Boxer has a cut or scrape that is taking longer than usual to heal (e.g., bleeding for a long time, a scab forming very slowly) the delayed healing may be due to a mast cell tumor., Mast cell tumors cannot be diagnosed only on physical appearance. In addition to a physical examination, your vet will perform several diagnostic tests. Your vet will first take blood and urine samples to analyze your Boxer’s overall health and determine if he’s healthy enough to handle the rigors of cancer treatment.Fine needle aspiration (FNA) can provide an initial mast cell tumor diagnosis. FNA is a non-surgical procedure during which your vet will use a small, thin needle to obtain a small sample.It is usually performed before a biopsy.A biopsy, which is the surgical removal of a large sample, confirms a mast cell tumor diagnosis. The biopsy will let your vet know how aggressive the tumor is, as well as its physical margins (barrier between tumor and healthy cells).Under a microscope, mast cells looks like look fried eggs filled with dark granules.Your vet may perform several other diagnostic tests, including chest x-rays, abdominal ultrasound, and ultrasound-guided FNAs of different organs (e.g., liver, spleen), to determine the tumor’s stage (how much it has spread throughout the body)., Surgery is usually the best option for treating mast cell tumors.It is ideal for mast cell tumors that are not aggressive and have not spread. However, if the mast cell tumor has spread to other body parts, then surgery would not be practical. Other treatment options, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, would be needed.


Your vet will use the diagnostic test results to determine if your Boxer’s mast cell tumor can be treated with surgery, and if your Boxer is healthy enough for surgery.

, If your Boxer has surgery, your vet will prescribe several medications for your Boxer to take before surgery. The medications will help prevent some of the secondary effects of mast cell tumors. Benadryl, for example, will keep mast cells from releasing histamine, which plays a role in allergic reactions. Your vet will also prescribe a medication to prevent stomach ulcers.Prednisone, a steroid, is commonly given before surgery to shrink the tumor.Prednisone has several negative side effects, including vomiting and diarrhea, increased water intake and urination, and GI bleeding.Follow all prescription instructions carefully.

, During surgery, your vet will take up to several centimeters of healthy tissue around the tumor. Wide surgical margins are needed to remove as much of the tumor as possible. However, local spread of the tumor can make complete surgical removal difficult.The tumor biopsy would help your vet determine how far to cut around, and under, the tumor.
The location of the tumor could also make complete removal difficult. For example, wide margins could be challenging if the tumor is on your Boxer’s head.After surgery, your vet will likely have a sample of the tumor analyzed to determine if the surgical margins were wide enough to remove the entire tumor. If not, then your Boxer may need a second surgery.
Following surgery, your vet will give you at-home care instructions for your Boxer, such as monitoring his incision and giving him medications.

, Chemotherapy works by disrupting the cell cycle of cancer cells and stopping their development.For very aggressive mast cell tumors, chemotherapy may be an effective treatment option. Several chemotherapy drugs, such as vinblastine, are available to treat mast cell tumors.Your vet will decide which combination of chemotherapy drugs to use for treatment.


Chemotherapy can be used to kill tumor tissue that was not removed during surgery. It can be also be used if the tumor has spread to nearby lymph nodes.Be aware that chemotherapy drugs can have serious side effects, including liver damage and weakening of the immune system. Also, a mast cell tumor’s response to chemotherapy is unpredictable., Radiation therapy uses a targeted beam of radiation to damage DNA in cancer cells, causing cell death.It can be used in several different ways to treat mast cell tumors, such as when complete surgical removal is not successful.It can also be used to prevent tumor spread to local lymph nodes.If your Boxer cannot undergo a second surgery, radiation therapy would help provide long-term tumor control in the area where the tumor was removed.Radiation therapy requires general anesthesia. Your Boxer may experience some discomfort at the site of radiation, which would be treated with pain or anti-inflammatory medications.Radiation therapy is expensive. In addition, the nearest veterinary center that could administer radiation therapy may not be convenient for you to get to., Some newer drug therapies can be effective for treating mast cell tumors. These drugs, called tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), prevent the development of cancerous mast cells.Your vet can determine if TKIs will benefit your Boxer.


TKIs are more targeted than chemotherapy drugs, meaning they will primarily target cancer cells and avoid healthy cells.

Take your dog to a veterinarian if you suspect ARVC.,
Consent to emergency treatment.,
Follow your veterinarian's suggestions for treatment.,
Give your dog its medicine regularly.,
Discuss with your veterinarian whether the boxer needs to avoid exercise.,
Regularly assess the effectiveness of the treatment.,
Look for the general signs of a heart condition.,
Pay attention to fainting or dizziness.,
Get your boxer screened for an irregular heartbeat.,
Understand what ARVC entails.,
Find out if there is a history of this problem in your dog's hereditary line.",How to Treat Heart Conditions in Boxers," It is important to get the dog looked at, so that you can lessen the risk of sudden death. Your veterinary office has the tools and know how to keep a dog in crisis alive.


It's a good idea to call the veterinary office while you are on your way so that they can be prepared for your arrival. This will give them time to secure a space and supplied for your dogs treatment.;
, If the dog has a crisis while in veterinary care, the veterinarian will give emergency treatment to keep your dog alive. This usually includes intravenous administration of drugs, such as lidocaine or procainamide, to help get the heart back in a regular pattern.

, Human patients with erratic heartbeats are often fitted with a cardio-converting defibrillator. However, these have not met with success in dogs and thus are not used.Instead, the mainstay of therapy is the use of drugs that control the heartbeat and heart rate.


Boxers with ARVC take a tablet form of antiarrhythmic drugs.The drug most commonly used is sotalol, which is often combined with another drug called mexiletine.
Different drug cocktails seem to suit some dogs more than others. Thus, another possible combination is mexiletine with atenolol or procainamide.

, It's important to keep your dog on its medicine for as long as the veterinarian deems it's necessary. This will require a commitment on your part to be consistent.


For example, sotalol is usually given two or three times a day. This will clearly require quite a bit of your time to get it administered correctly.

, Whether to rest a Boxer with ARVC or not is controversial. The extra demands placed on the heart by exercise could precipitate a heart attack in certain cases, but complete rest can lead to weight gain, which places a different stress on the heart.Indeed, it can be exceedingly difficult to get a Boxer to rest, as they are high energy dogs, so that option may be out of your control.

, Once treatment is started, success can be measured in terms of reduced fainting episodes. However, repeat Holter recordings are also advisable to assess the effectiveness of treatment.Regular assessment can tell you whether the irregular heartbeat is being managed or if you need to consider changing the medication your dog is on.

, While ARVC is by far the most common heart condition in boxers, these dogs can have other heart conditions, such as arrhythmias.Be sure that you know the signs that could signal a variety of heart conditions, or other illnesses, which include:Coughing
Wheezing
Heavy breathing
Exhaustion and Lethargy

, Dogs under 12 months of age rarely show any clinical signs of ARVC and the problem mainly affects young adult dogs. However, in several forms of ARVC, dizziness and fainting are usually seen. Three forms of ARVC exist, with different signs:Some dogs have ARVC but show no signs. The problem is only diagnosed when a 24-hour ECG monitor is fitted for screening purposes and irregular heart beats detected.
There are dogs that show signs as a result of the irregular heartbeat not supplying enough blood to the brain. This includes dizziness, fainting, and sudden death.
A rare form of ARVC leads to heart failure as a result of weakening of the muscle of the heart wall. This is also associated with fainting, but can be associated with more classic signs of heart disease, such as coughing (due to fluid retention in the lungs), liver enlargement, and fluid in the belly., During routine vaccination visits, or if the dog is sick, the vet will listen to the Boxer's heart with a stethoscope to check for irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias). However, a normal finding based on several minutes of listening does not guarantee the dog does not have ARVC. Should the vet hear an irregular beat then a Holter harness is advisable to assess the extent of the problem.


Any Boxer with a history of fainting should be screened for ARVC. Screening programs of asymptomatic dogs advise testing once a year after the dog's second birthday. This involves fitting the dog with a 24-hour ECG device called a Holter harness. This is because the irregular heartbeats can be intermittent, and they can be missed if the sole screening is listening with a stethoscope.
Additional screening, such as blood tests and a heart ultrasound exam, is necessary in order to exclude other health conditions that could cause an irregular heartbeat.

, ARVC leads to the muscle of the wall of the right ventricle, one of the two main pumping chambers in the heart, becoming infiltrated with fat. This interferes with the ability of the conduction of electrical impulses through the heart wall which contraction. This leads, at the least, to an irregular heartbeat.If the beat is so poorly coordinated that the heart fails to push blood to the brain, the dog can collapse and die.

, ARVC is a heart disease which is hereditary, meaning it is passed down from the parents. The actual prevalence is not known because some cases don't show symptoms and some cases don't lead to death. This means there are dogs that haven't been screened which have the disease.If you know there is a history of the problem in your dog's line, then you can be more proactive about guarding against the disease.

Notice the symptoms of entropion.,
Let your vet diagnose entropion.,
Consider what entropion does to your Boxer.",How to Treat Entropion in Boxers1," There are specific symptoms that will develop in your Boxer if he has entropion. Notice if your Boxer blinks one or both eyes excessively, which is due to the eyelash or fur bothering the eye. Your Boxer may also rub excessively at this eye, have excessive watering in this eye, have a buildup of pus in the eye, or become overly sensitive to light.In many cases, entropion may also cause a scratch on your Boxer's cornea, which may lead to the development of an ulcer.This eye irritation, if left untreated, may lead to a buildup of dark scar tissue on the cornea of your Boxer's eye, which is called pigmentary keratitis. This condition may lead to a partial loss of your Boxer's vision or a blurring of his vision due to the buildup of scar tissue buildup.In rare cases, the ulcer may lead to a perforation on your Boxer's eye, which causes pain and may lead to potential blindness or loss of the eyeball.;
, Entropion can only be officially diagnosed by taking your Boxer to the veterinarian. Your vet will examine your Boxer and decide if his eyelid or eyelids are inverted or folded inwards, which is the cause of the entropion. Your vet will also check your Boxer's eye for any damage made by the folding, such as scratches, scarring, or ulcers.


Ulcers or scarring will be diagnosed by performing a stain test on your Boxer's eye.
This condition typically arises within the first year of a Boxer's life. This is because the symptoms are so noticeable and irritating for your dog., Entropion is a condition where a portion of your Boxer's eyelid folds in and under on its own accord. This physical abnormality causes the lid to come into contact with your Boxer's eyeball surface or cornea. When this happens, the eyelashes or the fur on your Boxer's eyelids irritate the eye, which causes the physical symptoms.


This causes your Boxer's eye to tear or become reddened.
If left untreated, your Boxer's condition will only get worse and may result in the loss of the eye."
"
Cure the damage to the eye.,
Treat underlying eye conditions.,
Tack your puppy Boxer's eyes.,
Get follow up tacking treatment.",How to Treat Entropion in Boxers2," Before you can treat your Boxer's entropion, you need to treat any eye damage. Your Boxer's eye may be swollen, infected, scratched, or damaged in some way from the hairs and fur of the eyelid. To treat these things, your vet will give you a combination of eye, pain, and inflammation medication to treat the issues on your Boxer's eye. In rare cases, preliminary surgery to correct severe damage may be needed before you can treat the entropion.


The exact medication and doses will vary depending on the exact extent of the damage to your Boxer's eye. Talk to your vet about what is needed for your Boxer's particular case., In some cases, your Boxer's entropion may be caused by a secondary eye condition. These conditions may include certain eye diseases, a history of trauma to the eye, or chronic or acute eye inflammation. If your vet diagnoses an underlying condition that caused the entropion, you need to have these conditions treated before you can treat the entropion.


In many cases, treating these underlying conditions will make your Boxer's entropion go away. In this is the case with your Boxer, they will not need any additional treatment. If the entropion does not clear up despite fixing these conditions, your Boxer may still need surgery for the entropion.
The types of treatment you Boxer may need to treat the underlying conditions will vary depending on what these conditions are., If your Boxer is a puppy, your vet will not clear them for surgery until he is older. The vet can't fully assess the dog for corrective surgery until he's finished growing, so the vet performs this temporary and less invasive procedure as a temporary fix.


During this procedure, your Boxer's eyelids are tacked with temporary sutures. This will help shift the shape of your Boxer's eyelid so it no longer scratches at his eye., After the original tacking of your Boxer puppy's eyelid, he may need to have follow up tacking treatments. These will be done if your Boxer's eyelid is not pulled back enough to eliminate the entropion. These treatments will continue until your Boxer's problem is fixed or until he is old enough to have surgery.


Even if the entropion is not getting better with tacking, your vet will continue it until your Boxer is old enough to get surgery."

Look for lumps on the skin.,
Check your Boxer for lumps under the skin.,
Monitor changes to the lump.,
Watch for reactions to histamines.,
Recognize your dog's risk.,
Get medical attention.,
Get a physical examination.,
Test the tumor's cells.,
Reassess the lump.,
Get surgery to remove the tumors.,
Check for secondary tumors.,
Follow the veterinarian's treatment plan.",How to Diagnose Mast Cell Tumors in Boxers," Pay attention to any new lump you find on your dog. Mast cell tumors (MCT) are notoriously difficult to describe because they show up in a variety of ways. MCT might be smooth or bumpy. The lump may be large or small. There may just be one lump or several all together.At their most innocent, MCT can be pea-sized skin lumps on the surface of the skin.;
, MCT can also form round lumps beneath the skin. Just like superficial lumps, these external MCT can range in texture and feel. These MCT can sometimes be mistaken for harmless fatty lumps. Unfortunately, they're incredibly dangerous for your dog.


Most MCT form along the dog's trunk and limbs., MCT can change in size so it's important to pay attention to the size of the lump or any changes in its appearance. Sometimes the MCT might look harmless and then they seem sore and inflamed. Or, you may notice your dog only has one lump, but there are more a few weeks later.MCT may change so gradually that it's hard to notice, especially if it develops over several months. Or, the MCT might change rapidly, within several days.

, In general, MCT won't cause your dog pain or irritation, unless they're scratched. Mast cells contain natural chemicals, like histamines, heparin, and proteins which break down tissue. If there are several MCT in an area and the MCT are scratched or traumatized, these chemicals can suddenly release. These chemicals can have a dangerous effect on your dog and can even send him into shock. Signs of a reaction to MCT chemicals include:Swelling of the lumps
Itchy lumps
Vomiting
Ulcers
Blood in the stool
Abnormalities in blood clotting

, Although any dog can develop MCT, certain breeds are genetically prone to develop them. These include the Golden Retriever, Boston Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, pugs, bulldogs, and the Boxer. Of these, the Boxer is at the highest risk.MCT can occur in dogs of any age and they are frequently found in young and middle-aged dogs.

, If you notice any lump or believe your Boxer is reacting to chemicals from a MCT, get him checked by a veterinarian as soon as possible. Just looking at the lump isn't enough to determine what kind of a lump it is or what caused it.High-risk breeds should always have any new skin lump examined, no matter how harmless it looks.

, The vet will check your dog and feel his lymph nodes. This is to check whether or not the lymph nodes are swollen or enlarged, which can be a sign of an aggressive MCT. The vet will carefully check for other skin lumps.


Your vet will feel your Boxer's abdomen to see whether or not the lumps have spread internally.

, The vet will place a fine needle into the lump and pull the syringe back. This aspirates (sucks back) a sample of cells into the needle. The vet can then spray the cells onto a microscope slide and a cytologist can examine them under a microscope.The cytologist looks for the typical granular appearance of mast cells., If the sample doesn't show mast cells and the vet is certain that the sample was good, your Boxer might not have MCT. The vet will probably want to monitor the lump closely. If it gets larger or you notice your dog scratching it, you'll need to have your dog reassessed.


A negative sample doesn't guarantee that the lump isn't a mass cell tumor. Sample sizes are usually so small that correct testing depends on mass cells being sucked up into the syringe.

, If the cell sample shows that your dog has MCT, this confirms the diagnosis. Your dog will need to have the lumps surgically removed. After the surgery, your veterinarian will discuss further treatment options with you since your dog may need additional surgery or radiation.Once removed, the whole lump will be sent to a histologist for analysis. This will confirm whether the lump was a MCT or not.

, Since some forms of MCT are more aggressive than others, your dog will be screened for secondary tumors. The vet will also use the analysis from the lump that was already removed to determine if your dog has an aggressive tumor.


Aggressive secondary tumors can also be found using special stains that show up in malignant cells., If your Boxer has aggressive MCT that are spreading, the vet may put him on medication while he gets treatment. Medications might include steroids to kill cancerous cells or antihistamines to reduce inflammation caused by the tumor.Side effects of steroids include increased thirst, increased appetite, nausea or vomiting, and panting. Your dog may need antacids to reduce some of these side effects.

Pay attention to swollen lymph nodes.,
Monitor for changes in eating habits.,
Look for declining health.,
Check for anemia.",How to Diagnose Lymphoma in Boxers1," Swelling lymph nodes is one of the most recognizable symptoms for lymphoma. Swollen lymph nodes are most often noticed when the owner is petting the dog. The two most common places you may find them are under the jaw and behind the knee.Lymph nodes that can be felt through the skin are paired, left and right. The swelling tends to be symmetrical, so if the lymph nodes in front of the left shoulder are enlarged, the one on the right side may be also.
Places to feel for enlargement include under the chin, in front of the shoulders, in the armpits, in the groin, and behind the knees.The swelling of the lymph nodes is not painful for the dog, so your dog may show no symptoms of pain. Many dogs with lymphoma are not obviously ill when first taken to the vet, so the swollen lymph nodes may be the only symptom.;
, Lymphoma that attacks internal lymph nodes may make your dog change his eating habits. He may start losing weight and stop eating as much as he used to. Your dog may become thirstier than usual.Your dog may also have stomach issues, like vomiting or diarrhea.
Due to the increased thirst, you dog may urinate more.

, If the internal organs are flooded with white cells, then the dog may become appear to suddenly decline. He may exhibit vague, general signs of signs of ill health, including a lack of energy. Your dog may stop participating in his usual activities or lay around more than usual.Your dog may also start breathing heavier and panting when there is no reason. Some dogs have episodes of fever.
Your dog’s face or legs may also swell.

, Some cases of lymphoma involve anemia. The anemia is due to the bone marrow producing white cells rather than red cells. Your dog may also have bleeding problems, which is due to lack of production of platelets because of the higher production of white cells instead of red cells.To check your dog for anemia, look at his gums. If he has gums that are paler in color than normal, he is probably anemic.

Look for signs of symptomatic ARVC.,
Look for the signs of the fatigued heart form of ARVC.,
Understand that there may be no outward signs of asymptomatic ARVC.,
Research ARVC when you adopt a Boxer.,
Consider genetic testing if considering breeding.,
Get a dog exhibiting symptoms checked out by a veterinarian.,
Discuss additional testing with the veterinarian.,
Follow the treatment advice of your veterinarian.",How to Diagnose Heart Conditions in Boxers," This is the most common form. Symptoms of this type of ARVC include irregular heartbeats and low blood pressure. The signs associated with low blood pressure include sudden weakness, fainting, and reluctance or inability to exercise. Unfortunately one of the symptoms is also sudden death.Stay alert for changes from the norm. For example, if the dog becomes lethargic and can't keep up on walks, you should seek a vet check for the dog.;
, This is less common and occurs when the heart muscle becomes fatigued. With this form of ARVC the wall of the heart thins and is a weaker pump. Dogs with this form of the disease often have coughs, exercise intolerance, and rapid shallow breathing.


Basically, the signs are those of congestive heart failure. These include a moist cough that is worse at night, a swollen belly, a weak pulse with a fast heart rate, breathing difficulties, fainting, and collapse.

, Asymptomatic is the form that means the dog is only affected mildly and shows no outward sign there is a problem. It might be that the dog only skips an occasional heartbeat and this has no overall effect on the dog's circulation or health.


The symptoms of this form are hard to spot and it is not straightforward for your vet to diagnose. To an owner, their dog is likely to appear totally fit and well.
The dog may have the occasional skipped heartbeat but this is not enough to cause the dog to faint.

, Because the risk to boxers is so high, it's important to know about the condition. ARVC affects the muscular wall of the heart, and interferes with the conduction of the electrical impulses which generate each heart beat. The exact mechanism by which this occurs is unclear but experts believe it may be linked to the movement of calcium between cells in the heart muscle.Experts believe this condition is genetic, and passed down from parent to pup by an autosomal recessive gene. This means that not all individuals who have the gene are clinically affected but may be silent carriers capable of passing the fault down to the next generation.

, This is very important if you are considering breeding a boxer dog, even if it shows no signs of ARVC. However, the genetic test for ARVC is not infallible. A negative test is not a guarantee that the dog is free of ARVC, while a positive test confirms the diagnosis.The genetic blood test does have its uses, because it helps to rule out dogs that should definitely not go forward for breeding, but unfortunately some affected dogs may slip through the net.
Two genetic mutations have been detected to date. However, it seems likely that additional contributing mutations will be found in the future, which accounts for the limitations of the blood test as it stands.This testing is not usually used on dogs that are not going to be bred. The test can tell you if the dog has the genetic mutations associated with ARVC but even a positive test doesn't mean that a dog will develop actual ARVC. In addition, the test does not tell a dog owner whether if the dog does develop ARVE if the condition will be mild or will include severe symptoms., The vet will take a history to understand when symptoms develop. For example, is the fainting linked to exercise? The vet will then check the dog over to troubleshoot for any problem that could indicate a health problem.


The vet then hones the physical exam in on the cardiovascular system and uses a stethoscope to listen to the heartbeat, check the heart rhythm, and measure the heart rate.
The vet listens for any murmurs and sounds that could indicate heart failure, such as fluid in the lungs, as well as listening to the dog's pulse.

, You will need to pay for additional testing, so be sure that you approve tests before they are done. If the vet detects an erratic heart rate, given that the patient is a Boxer, he or she will probably prioritize the next test as an ECG or a Holter test. If the dog has a history of fainting during exercise but its heart sounds normal in the clinic then the next step is to fit the dog with a Holter harness.


A Holter harness is a 24-hour ECG recorder designed for dogs. It records a heart trace for a full day, so if the abnormal event is erratic or triggered by a specific event, such as exercise, the Holter will record it. This gives the best chance of detecting asymptomatic or silent ARVC in Boxer dogs.If there is an obvious heart arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) the vet may want to run other tests, such as a heart ultrasound exam and chest x-ray. While these tests don't specifically diagnose ARVC, they give information about what state the heart is in and if it has become enlarged and the heart wall thinned. This can influence the veterinarian's decision about what medications to start the dog on.

, Once the condition is diagnosed, there are treatments that can support the heart and slow up deterioration. Treatment takes the form of anti-arrythmogenic drugs, which help to regulate the heartbeat. In addition, if the heart has become fatigued then diuretics and drugs to help the heart to pump more strongly may be prescribed.


Also avoid extreme exercise with your dog, which could strain the dog's heart and push them over the edge. Also, a diagnosis enables your vet to avoid certain medications which can worsen the symptoms of ARVC.
There is some research that suggests giving fish oil can reduce the risk of an irregular heartbeat in boxers with ARVC.Treatment with medication can be costly. This is not only because of the cost of the medications themselves but because of the expense of regular monitoring to ensure that the correct dose is prescribed.

Schedule surgery for your Boxer.,
Get your Boxer surgery.,
Keep your Boxer in a cone.,
Get follow up treatment.",How to Treat Entropion in Boxers3," The only way to treat entropion is surgery to repair the lid abnormality. You will have to work with your vet to figure out when the best time is for your Boxer to have the surgery. There may also be other conditions and considerations that need to be taken into account before your Boxer can have surgery., In preparation for the surgery, your Boxer will be under general anesthesia for this surgery.During the surgery, your Boxer's eyeball will first be covered in order to prevent damage during the procedure. The vet surgeon will then cut an elliptical shaped piece of tissue from under the eyelid margin and sutures it together with the upper lid.


This will pull the eyelid margin and last area back into the place they belong., After your Boxer goes through the surgery, the eye sutures will need to be protected from irritation, scratching, or anything else your Boxer may do to them. Because of this, your vet will likely give your Boxer a cone to wear until the sutures heal.


In some cases, antibiotics drops and ointment may also be used to help protect and heal any eye damage.Your vet will also likely tell you to not bath your Boxer until the sutures come out.

, Once your Boxer's entropion has been treated with surgery, he will need some follow up visits with the vet to take care of his eye or eyes. Your Boxer will likely be on antibiotics to help prevent any infections from occurring in his eye as he heals from the surgery.


You may also need refills for any eye drops or ointments prescribed at the time of surgery to continue healing your Boxer's eye and eyelids."

Take your dog to the vet.,
Get a physical exam.,
Perform blood tests.,
Biopsy the lymph nodes.",How to Diagnose Lymphoma in Boxers2," As soon as you believe your Boxer may have lymphoma, take him to the vet. The earlier you catch the lymphoma, the better chance your dog has for survival.


If you feel any swollen lymph nodes, take your Boxer to the vet even if he is not showing any symptoms. Lymph nodes may appear without any other symptoms.If your dog shows signs of general declining or poor health, you should take your dog to the vet immediately since those signs might be due to a number of serious conditions.

, The first thing your vet will do is perform a thorough physical examination. The vet will feel the abdomen to check for enlargement of the spleen and any enlarged lymph nodes.


The vet will also listen to the chest for any signs of difficulty breathing. She will also check to see if the heart is muffled as a result of lymph node enlargement.

, After the physical exam, the vet will perform a blood test to check organ function. The blood test will also look at the balance of red and white blood cells in the body.This cannot diagnose lymphoma, but it can point to a problem. If the numbers of lymphocytes are abnormally high, the cause will need looking into.
If the physical examination turns up anything in the abdomen or the chest, the vet may arrange an ultrasound. Ultrasound scans of the abdomen or radiographs of the chest will check for enlargement of inguinal lymph nodes and also organ enlargement. This helps the clinician decide how far advanced the cancer is, which helps decision making with regard to treatment and survival times., A definitive diagnosis is made by either biopsying one of the enlarged lymph nodes, or by taking a fine needle and sucking up a sample of cells through it. Then, the vet will examine the sample under a microscope to look at the cell types.This allows the histologist to see which cells are present and if they are normal or abnormal.


The dog will be put under anesthesia to perform the biopsy. Pain is usually minimal afterwards, but a vet can prescribe pain meds if your dog is in pain due to the biopsy.In the event of a sample being inconclusive, there is now a blood test available which can confirm if lymphoma is present. The cBLT looks for biomarkers given off by lymphoma. It is also a useful way of giving advanced warning of this condition even before lymph node enlargement happens or as a warning that a relapse is about to happen."

Make sure that your dog has had all of its necessary immunizations.,
Get your American Bulldog spayed or neutered.,
Understand that American Bulldogs are prone to certain health conditions.",How to Raise an American Bulldog1," Vaccinations play an important role in any dog’s health, including your American Bulldog's. The standard immunizations for dogs include Rabies, which is administered at 12 weeks of age or older and then every 1 to 3 years depending on your local laws and your vet’s recommendations. Distemper, Parvovirus, Hepatitis, and Para influenza are usually administered together.


Puppies should receive a set of four injections every three weeks starting at six weeks of age and then annually, as adults, again based on your veterinarian's recommendations.
Your veterinarian will also make recommendations for items such as monthly heartworm preventive, flea & tick preventive, and deworming protocols based on the season and specific region you live in. Routine physical exams, which can include fecal exams, a heartworm test, and routine blood work will help detect any health issues that need to be addressed in order to maintain your American Bulldog's long-term health.;
, Spaying and neutering are procedures that prevent unwanted pregnancies and can help to eliminate many health and behavioral issues. Neutering can prevent testicular cancers, prostate problems, urinary marking, and some aggressive behaviors in males. Spayed females have a greatly reduced incidence of mammary tumors and no possibility of uterine infections or uterine cancer.


Ideally an American Bulldog puppy should have this done at around six months of age. Discuss this procedure with your veterinarian during your regular puppy visits or at the first visit after adopting an adult dog., Some of the more common ones include, but are not limited to, brachycephalic syndrome, laryngeal paralysis, hip dysplasia, deafness, hypothyroidism, entropion, and prolapse of the third eyelid. Most of these health concerns are treatable. Some may only require a simple medication while others may need to be corrected with a surgical procedure.Consult with your veterinarian if you have any health concerns regarding your American Bulldog. If you see the signs of any of these conditions, for instance if you suspect that your dog cannot hear you or your dog is in pain while walking (a sign of developing hip dysplasia), it is best to get your dog checked by its vet.
One way to avoid many of these problems is to get an American Bulldog puppy that has been well bred. Good, experienced breeders take the time to breed dogs so that there are less chance of these health conditions. Dogs that have been inbreed, on the other hand, have a higher chance of inheriting hereditary health problems.

Learn the treatment for lymphoma.,
Learn what lymphoma is.,
Know which breeds are at risk.",How to Diagnose Lymphoma in Boxers3," If your dog has lymphoma, he can be treated and go into remission. Treatment of lymphoma consists of chemotherapy drugs given over a few months or weeks. In some cases, the dog may undergo radiation or surgery.The success of treatment depends on how advanced the condition is when diagnosed, which cell type is producing the lymphoma, and how responsive that individuality is to treatment.
Most dogs can go into remission and live nine to 14 months., Lymphoma arises as a result of the body producing too many white cells. These white cells are part of the immune system, and their job is to fight infections. However, when too many are produced, they overwhelm the body and get soaked up in the organs where they cause enlargement. The location of which organ soaks up the lymphocytes determines which type of lymphoma develops.The main types of lymphoma are multicentric, mediastinal, gastrointestinal, cutaneous, and central nervous system.
Multicentric is one of the most common forms of lymphoma since it affects the lymph nodes, which become swollen by the extreme number of white cells they contain. Some of these lymph nodes are internal while several can be felt through the skin.

, Lymphoma can potentially affect any breed, although several breeds have an increased probability. The Boxer breed has an increased risk of lymphoma. Other predisposed breeds include the Basset Hound, Bullmastiff, Airedale, and Bulldog.This condition affects both middle aged or older dogs. It is relatively rare in young animals.

Look for squinting.,
See if your dog has watery eyes.,
Pay attention to your dog rubbing his eye.,
Notice the color of your Boxer's eyes.,
Consider your dog's risk.,
Get your dog's eyes examined.,
Apply pressure to your dog's eye.,
Use local anesthetic.,
Follow treatment recommendations.",How to Diagnose Entropion in Boxers," If your dog is feeling uncomfortable, you may notice him squinting or narrowing his eye. Compare one eye with the other to see if one eye is worse. If both eyes are affected then the dog may appear to have narrow eyes.If the eye is really bothering your dog, he may even hold his eye shut to keep the lid from rubbing against the eyeball.;
, Your dog's eye may sense a foreign object, so his eye will water as the eye tries to protect itself against irritation. It will keep watering, trying to flush out the dust and grit it believes is causing the problem.You might notice your dog's face is constantly damp or see reddish-brown stains on the fur beneath his eyes from the tears., If your Boxer's eye is irritated, he may swipe at his eye using a paw. He may also rub his face along the ground. This constant rubbing can lead to an eye infection, so look for yellow-green discharge.Understand that some Boxers with entropion don't rub their eyes. This is because they've become so used to the constant irritation, that they assume the feeling is normal., If there's extreme irritation and rubbing over the course of several months, the eye may start making scar tissue to protect the surface. This scar tissue looks milky and will start to take on a blue appearance as layers accumulate. When this happens, your dog won't be able to see through the tissue.


In less severe cases of irritation, your dog's eye might look red. This is because rubbing causes the white of the eye to become inflamed and red., Dogs with short-noses (brachycephalics) are at increased risk, because they have extra folds of skin on their faces. These can push on the eyelids and force them to roll inward.This puts Boxers at risk for entropion.


Be aware that the symptoms of entropion are similar to those of other conditions like conjunctivitis, trauma to the eye, a foreign body in the eye, and glaucoma. If you suspect an eye problem, get your Boxer checked by a vet who can confirm the diagnosis.

, The veterinarian will look carefully at your Boxer's eyes to check for symmetry. The vet will also measure the gap between the eyelids (known as the palpebral fissure). This thorough examination will check the internal and external structures of your dog's eyes.


To check the eyes, the vet uses a tool called an ophthalmoscope which can magnify the cornea, making it easy to see if eyelashes are rubbing against the surface of the eye., If the veterinarian suspects your Boxer has entropion, the vet may put away the ophthalmoscope and apply gentle pressure instead. Applying pressure while pulling the eyelid downward can help roll the eyelid out. If your dog really has entropion, this will adjust the eyelid into the correct position.


The vet can confirm the diagnosis by releasing pressure. If the eyelid rolls back into the eye, your dog has entropion.

, If your dog's eye is very sore, causing him to squint, the vet may put a few drops of local anesthetic into the eye. This will numb any discomfort and let the eyelid sit in its natural position.


If the eyelid sits normally once pain is gone, this means it's not true entropion. Instead, it may be caused by some other discomfort.

, The veterinarian will probably recommend surgery to treat entropion. A veterinary surgeon will remove a small bit of tissue from underneath the eyelid. This reduces the amount of tissue, helping the eyelid sit in a more normal position.Surgery for entropion is usually only performed on adult-size Boxers.
Your Boxer may go through several small corrective surgeries. This prevents removing too much tissue from the eyelid.

Feed an American Bulldog puppy a high-quality puppy food made specifically for large breed puppies.,
Find a high quality food that features a meat as the first ingredient listed on the bag's label.,
Reduce the risk of gastric dilatation-volvulus, also known as bloat, through diet.,
Provide unlimited access to water.,
Bathe your American Bulldog only when necessary.,
Brush your American Bulldog on a regular basis.,
Clean the folds around your American Bulldog's face regularly.",How to Raise an American Bulldog2," This helps to ensure that it maintains healthy bones and joints while it is growing. The puppy should remain on this diet until it is around 18 months of age. It can then be considered an adult and gradually be switched to an adult food.

, This will give the American Bulldog the protein it needs and it will limit the amount of carbohydrates it consumes. Crude protein should be no less than 30 percent and crude fat no less than 20 percent. The fiber content needs to be 4 percent or less.

, American Bulldogs are large breed dogs and thus are susceptible to GDV.This is a life threatening condition and requires immediate veterinary treatment. To help prevent this from occurring there are several things related to feeding that can be done. Feed two or three smaller, non-fatty meals a day, not in elevated bowls, and don’t mix dry food and water.


Also, restrict your dog’s activity for at least an hour after feeding and discourage them from drinking large amounts of water at one time.

, It is always important to allow your dog access to a fresh, clean water source. This breed will need to drink as desired. Keep a hand towel nearby for wiping up excessive drool or slobber that, unfortunately, is a common occurrence for this breed.

, American Bulldogs tend to have short, smooth hair that rarely requires bathing. In general, their coat is easy to maintain. Just give your pup a bath if it rolls in something smelly or is physically dirty.

, American Bulldogs do shed much more than you would think.Invest in lint rollers for your furniture and clothes if shedding becomes an issue for you.

, Because American Bulldog's have short muzzles, which gives their face a ""smushed"" appearance, some dogs tend to have excess skin folds between their eyes and nose. It is easy for dirt and moisture to get stuck in these facial folds and cause irritation and odor. Be sure to clean or wipe in between the skin folds regularly with a damp paper towel or washcloth and a mild soap.


Try to avoid getting any soap into your dog's eyes. If this happens, rinse its eyes thoroughly with clean water.
Most veterinary offices carry wipes that are safe to use on the face and near the eyes, specifically for this purpose.
After cleaning between the dog's facial folds, use a new, clean paper towel or washcloth to dry the area. This will help to avoid any excess moisture from developing into an irritating skin issue called fold dermatitis."
"
Socialize your American Bulldog with people and other animals when it is young.,
Pick a puppy that is already being socialized.,
Socialize your dog at its own speed.,
Keep your American Bulldog on leash when introducing it to new people, such as neighbors.,
Start obedience training as early as possible.,
Train with hand and voice commands.,
Use positive reinforcement with your dog.,
Consult a professional trainer or canine behaviorist if you are having trouble with your American Bulldog.",How to Raise an American Bulldog3," The goal is to show your dog that all people and pets should be engaged with calmly and respectfully.Take it to public areas, giving strangers the opportunity to pet and play with it. This is a very dominant breed and so you should take the time to socialize it early to avoid that behavior as much as possible. Socialization will help the dog develop an even temper.


This is an important part of raising an American Bulldog. Without socialization, your new dog may be suspicious of all new people and animals, which can lead to unwanted behaviors, such as biting.
You can socialize your dog by taking it to public areas and allowing it to have positive experiences with new people and pets. If at a dog park, slowly introduce your dog to the other dogs and people around you while still on the leash. If your dog seems to be friendly, comfortable, and welcomes the interaction, praise it for its good behavior and gradually allow more interaction off leash and in larger areas.

, If visiting a breeder to pick out a pup, there are some specific things to look for that can indicate socialization has already begun. Observe how the puppy interacts with its littermates as well as its parents. A shy, withdrawn, or overly cautious pup is probably not well socialized and has not been exposed to a lot of different situations. Well socialized pups are accustomed to many different sounds and actions going on around them and your presence shouldn’t be a big surprise. A less socialized pup may make just as good a pet as one who isn’t, it may simply require more time when training.


Remember that when you get a dog you want to avoid bad breeding situations, for example puppy mills. Not only do unethical breeders have inhumane conditions for their dogs and usually inbreed them, but they do not do the early training and socializing of their dogs that is imperative to raising a well-adjusted dog.

, Each dog will develop their social skills at their own speed, so go as slow as needed. As your dog becomes more socialized and comfortable with new things, you will see that it develops an overall better temperament.


Don't forget to introduce cats, children, and anything else that you want your dog to be familiar and comfortable with as well. Take your introductions slow!
When introducing your dog to a cat, don't let the animals see each other right off the bat. Keep them in separate rooms and allow them to smell each other under the closed door. After they get used to each other's smell, let them see each other from a distance. Over several days let them get closer to each other on a regular basis, all while keeping a hold of both.

, Also, know that in some areas there are legal liabilities related to owning this particular breed. There have also been cases of homeowner insurance policies being denied and the breed is actually banned from ownership in some areas. Research the situation in your area before committing to this breed., American Bulldogs are a very intelligent, strong willed, and frequently stubborn breed. This can make them a challenge to train, especially for first-time dog owners. They will need to know that you are the dominant one in the relationship and training them will require a lot of dedication and patience.

, It will be beneficial for you and your new pup to train with voice commands as well as hand signals. The upside to training with both of these commands is that if you are in a situation where your dog can't hear you, they can still see what you are asking them to do and can react accordingly.

, Positive reinforcement goes a long way with this breed, as they enjoy pleasing their owners. Since this breed loves attention from the people that they are bonded with, ignoring your dog when they exhibit bad behavior will work better than other disciplinary measures.


When trained and socialized well, American Bulldogs have the tools they need to judge a situation and decide when everything is OK or when they may need to act on their natural guarding instincts.

, During any sort of training, if you feel overwhelmed or your dog doesn't seem to be learning at a reasonable pace, consult a professional. They will be able to answer any questions or concerns you may be having about the process or techniques that you are using.Obedience schools can be a good option from the very beginning or to correct unwanted behaviors.

Give your American Bulldog regular, daily exercise.,
Remember that your Bulldog has more difficulty breathing than many other breeds.,
Reconsider choosing an American Bulldog if you want a lazy dog.,
Understand that American Bulldogs like to play rough.",How to Raise an American Bulldog4," This breed tends to be on the energetic and athletic side and will typically exhibit a much more even temperament when they receive proper amounts of exercise. Without exercise, you may have a bored and potentially destructive dog on your hands.


Daily exercise should consist of 30-40 minutes of varied activity that can include, but is not limited to, running, hiking, swimming, weight-pulling, and agility.

, Because of the facial structure of this breed, their ""smushed"" face means that they have narrow nasal passages. This can make it more difficult, than many other breeds, for them to breathe and to remain cool. Keep this in mind when you are exercising your dog on a hot day or for long periods of time. Be sure to allow for several water and cool-down breaks.


If you think that your American Bulldog is becoming overheated or can't catch its breath, this could be an emergency situation that will need medical assistance from your veterinarian.

, A Bulldog will not be happy lounging on the couch all day with no exercise. In that type of situation, it is easy for an American Bulldog to become overweight, which can lead to a variety of health issues, such as diabetes and injuries to their knees and hips.

, They have a natural tendency to play rough, so do not be surprised if your Bulldog plays and romps with vigor and occasionally sends things flying, including people. Have fun with your pup during exercise, but be careful too!"

Listen to your French Bulldog breathe.,
Monitor your dog during exercise.,
Look inside your dog's mouth.,
Monitor your French Bulldog's behavior.,
Take your French Bulldog to the veterinarian.,
Get your dog's throat examined.,
Consider further testing.,
Follow treatment advice.",How to Diagnose Breathing Problems in French Bulldogs," Under normal conditions (in cool weather and when your dog is not under stress), you'll probably hear some noisy breathing that doesn't bother him. But, if you close your eyes and hear noisy breathing that sounds like honking or rasping, your French Bulldog may have a breathing problem.


Breathing noise is caused by the compressed anatomy of the French Bulldog's airways. The noisier the breathing, the worse the condition.;
, If your dog is reluctant to exercise or lags behind on walks, he may be having trouble breathing. You may notice your French Bulldog pant heavily with his tongue lolling out.If your dog has breathing problems, exercise will place extra demands on his body. For example, his body will need more oxygen which he can't supply because he physically can't draw extra air in.

, If your French Bulldog is really struggling to breathe and is not getting enough oxygen, the membranes of his mouth and tongue will look blue or purple. Healthy membranes should appear pink.


You may also see your dog drooling. This is because he is concentrating so hard on breathing that he doesn't want to take time out to swallow., Your dog may collapse or faint if he is overtired and not getting enough oxygen. You may notice your dog seem uncomfortable or restless in hotter weather, when it's harder for him to breathe. Other signs of breathing problems include:Snorting
Choking
Vomiting
Gagging

, The vet will watch your dog's breathing and chest movements. The vet will also look for physical landmarks that would make it hard for your dog to breathe, like narrow nostrils or a large tongue that blocks the back of the throat. Listening to noisy breathing is also important in diagnosing breathing problems, so the veterinarian will listen to your dog's chest, heart, and lungs with a stethoscope. This can help rule out signs of chest infections and heart murmurs which creates fluid buildup in the lungs. Both of these conditions can contribute to breathing problems.


A normal dog's chest moves in and out when he breathes, but his abdomen does not. If the vet notices your dog using his abdominal muscles to breathe (abdominal effort), it means your dog is struggling to take breaths.The vet will check the heart and lungs because it could impact the safety of an anesthetic during surgery.

, The veterinarian will want to thoroughly examine the back of your dog's throat. Your dog will need anesthetic and sedation so that the veterinarian can pull his tongue far enough forward to see the area. An endotracheal tube will be inserted to keep his airway open while he's asleep.There is a risk associated with anesthesia because the dog can no longer protect his airway. This is why the intratracheal tube is put into the windpipe.

, If your veterinarian suspects that some other condition is causing the symptoms, additional testing might be needed. Chest x-rays can help rule out pneumonia, lungworm, or cancer. Advanced imaging techniques like MRI or CT scans can also help the veterinarian visualize your French Bulldog's anatomy (specifically the soft palate, windpipe, and tonsils).It's important for your veterinarian to know the length of your dog's palate, size of his tongue, and the size of his tonsils. This will help when it comes to planning corrective surgery.

, The veterinarian may recommend corrective surgery to trim back and remodel your dog's nostrils and soft palate. This can improve the shape of the back of the throat and allow more air to enter the nostrils. A specialist surgeon may also want to remove the tonsils.


While it's possible to correct some of your French Bulldog's anatomy, it is impossible to change the size of the tongue or width of the windpipe."

Give your English bulldog lots of attention and love.",How to Care for an English Bulldog," Wiping between your dog’s folds one time each day will prevent this.


Choose the right wipe for your dog’s skin. Use a nontoxic anti-fungal wipe. Try to choose one with many natural ingredients like cucumber and chamomile.Avoid wipes that have many chemicals and additives. If you have concerns, ask your vet for a recommendation as to which anti-fungal wipe is best for your dog.;
, Start daily cleaning with your dog from the time it is a small puppy.


Familiarize your dog with the cleanup process by having it sit in the same spot every time you begin the cleanup.

, If your dog comes to associate cleaning within its skin folds with pain, your job will be that much harder, and cause your dog undue stress. Give your doggie a treat both before you begin the cleaning process and after the process is complete. This way, the dog will come to associate having its skin cleaned with positive feelings and the knowledge that it will soon be rewarded.


With one hand, part the folds and use your other hand to apply the wipe gently to the skin within. You will probably need to wipe the same area several times, moving the wipe in overlapping swipes along folds of your dog’s body.
You may need several wipes to complete the job, but your dog will thank you and remain healthy.
Be sure to wipe its back, tummy, legs, and face. Healthy bulldog skin is smooth and soft. Check your dog’s face for irritation.Facial skin should be loose and wrinkly, but should not hang off the face. Check the belly for redness or signs of itching. If present, these may be signs of springtime allergies.

, If you see your dog constantly scratching, rubbing, or biting itself, this is a sign that your dog’s skin is irritated. Nasty odors -- especially those emanating from the face, groin, ears, and stomach -- might also be signs of irritated skin. You might also observe a brown discharge coming out from between the folds of your dog’s skin.When you observe that your dog’s skin may be irritated, investigate why and take proactive steps to solve the problem.

, Vets are specially trained to deal with severe problems like infected, itching, and dry skin.

, If you bathe your dog more frequently, you could remove the natural oils which protect its skin.Of course, if your dog starts to smell or has a romp in the mud, bathing is the only option. Generally, though, avoid bathing your dog often.


Use tear-free shampoo and work it into your dog’s skin folds when bathing. Lather the shampoo and let it sit for a minute or two before rinsing., Young bulldogs need several small meals throughout the day. Your puppy may need to eat up to four times a day as a puppy. Your dog will increase its weight rapidly -- possibly by as much as seven to eight times its birth weight -- within its first twelve months of life. Puppies generally need about 20-70 calories per pound of body weight. For instance, if your pup weighs ten pounds, it will need between 200 and 700 calories each day, depending on its activity level.Don’t just leave food out for your puppy. Even though it needs to eat more frequently than an adult bulldog, it is still susceptible to overeating. Removing bowls of food after your puppy has finished will keep it healthy.
Add a tablespoon of yogurt to your dog’s food. Yogurt contains probiotics that help bone growth and digestion in young bulldogs.

, After obtaining your bulldog (of any age), wait at least two weeks before changing its diet. After two weeks, gradually introduce new foods into its diet and alternate new foods with its standard diet. Monitor your dog’s reaction. If it has soft or excessive stool, switch back to the old diet, then try again later to introduce a different new food after two more weeks.

, The caloric needs of your bulldog will depend on its age and activity level. After about 18 months, your bulldog should be treated nutritionally as an adult. Older dogs usually need about 937 calories per day. Typical adult bulldogs need around 1,145 calories each day. A very active English bulldog could need as much as 1,300 calories in a day.While puppies require four meals each day, an adult will usually eat just twice each day.
Use the nutrition label on your dog food to calculate how many calories your doggie is taking in.
Adult bulldogs can weigh anywhere from 45 to 55 pounds, however, each dog's ideal weight varies depending on frame size. Learn to body score your dog so you can monitor the fat cover over the dog's rib and backbone, and decrease their ration if necessary. Talk to your vet about how much your pet should weigh.

, Your bulldog should receive a healthy balance of protein, carbs, fats, vitamins, and minerals. There are many commercial dog foods available which can satisfy your dog, and some dog foods that are designed specifically for bulldogs. Look for a dog food that is nutritious and ask your vet if you have specific concerns about what your dog is eating.


Avoid dog foods that are predominately carbs like corn and sugar.Dog foods that include high protein contents and slowly-digestible carbs like sweet potatoes and barley are good choices.
Feed your dog both food and water out of stainless steel bowls. Do not use plastic., If your bulldog is overweight, it may have heart, hip, and breathing problems later in life. Obesity also increases your dog’s chances of developing cancer by as much as 20%.You can keep its weight down by feeding it only moderate meals and providing opportunities for regular light exercise like going for walks at the park, or romps at the local dog park.


Feed your bulldog small kibbles so that it eats slowly. This will prevent both overeating and gas., While table scraps can often upset a bulldog’s tummy, there are many ways to include new foods and make fun changes to your dog’s meals.For instance, your bulldog might enjoy apple cinnamon drops.


To make apple cinnamon drops, you’ll need a large apple, a quarter cup of honey, a half cup of water, a half teaspoon of cinnamon, one cup of oatmeal, one and a half cups of flour, plus another eighth of a cup of flour.
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and mince the apple into small pieces. Combine the apple bits, water, oatmeal, and cinnamon into a dough by mixing together in a large mixing bowl. Place individual spoonfuls of the dough on an ungreased baking sheet spaced about two inches apart.
Place the eighth of a cup of flour in a small bowl. Rub the bottom of a flat-bottomed cup in the flour and stamp the spoonfuls of dough down on the baking sheet.
Bake for fifteen minutes, then remove and flip each apple cinnamon drop over. Bake for another fifteen minutes. Then, reduce heat and bake for thirty minutes at 325 degrees Fahrenheit., There are many foods that humans find yummy but are toxic to bulldogs. For instance, grapes, raisins, beer, raw bread dough, chocolate or anything caffeinated, garlic, and onions should never be consumed by dogs.English bulldogs, like all dogs, should especially avoid alcohol, grapes, and raisins.


Foods that are nonfatal but may irritate your bulldog include peas, beans, milk, and fatty or spicy foods., There are many problems that can develop in your dog’s eyes. Look closely at your dog’s eyes each day and monitor any unusual changes. Wipe away crusty bits or goop that often accumulates in the corners of bulldogs’ eyes. If you notice a heavy crusty layer and excessively runny eyes, take him to a vet.


If your dog’s eyelids are rolling inward, it might have entropion, a condition that can lead to tearing, squinting, and ulcers in the eye.
If your dog’s eyelids are sagging or appear to be rolling down, your dog might have ectropion. Your dog might display signs of dry eyes by blinking with unusual frequency.
If you observe any of these symptoms, or any other unusual eye problems in your dog, take it to a vet immediately., Foods high in beta-carotene are hard to find in dog food. However, adding small portions of foods high in beta carotene to your dog’s diet can keep its eyes healthy. Sweet potatoes and carrots, for instance, are good sources of beta carotene and dogs love them.

, Cherry eye is easy to identify because you will notice a small, round growth protruding from the corner or bottom of your dog’s eye. While it does not cause pain for your dog immediately, if it gets infected, it will.


To treat cherry eye, take your dog to the vet.Your vet will give your dog local anesthesia and apply an eye lubricant to the cherry. You may need to hold the dog’s head still. The vet might ask you to repeat the treatment several times a day, so pay close attention to his demonstration. After applying the anesthesia, dab a bit of eye lubricant on your fingertip. Smear it carefully around the base of the cherry. Gently push the popped-out cherry (in fact, a gland) back into the dog’s eye.Dogs eight weeks old or younger usually get cherry eye. In older dogs, surgery may be necessary to correct cherry eye.

, English bulldogs are notoriously low-energy animals. Still, they require exercise to stay healthy. Take your dog on short walks around the block as often as possible.As your dog builds stamina, extend the length of the walks. When the weather is nasty, throw a ball for your dog to chase, or play tug of war with it inside the house.


Giving your dog a chance to move also gives you and your dog time to bond.
Your dog might also enjoy playing with other doggies at the local dog park.

, They can be trained, but getting there can be difficult.Start slowly when training your English bulldog. Don’t expect it to learn tricks as fast as your other dogs. Practice a trick for a short time each day -- ten to fifteen minutes per session -- and keep at it.

, English bulldogs have lower energy levels than other dogs. Their small bodies perform well when going on short walks or playing around the house, but have a hard time running long distances or engaging in vigorous exercise.English bulldogs have flattened noses and so find it more difficult to breathe. It is important to be cautious in hot weather as they are prone to heat stroke. Take them on gentle walks in the cooler parts of the day, stick to the shade, and provide them with plenty of water. Work within the confines of what your dog wants to do. If it is panting heavily or seems lethargic, don’t push it to run around or exercise.

, Dogs that are neutered or spayed are less aggressive and easier to control than dogs that are not. A neutered/spayed dog is more focused on you than other dogs, and feels less obligated to prove its dominance to you or other dogs. Talk to your vet about setting up an appointment to neuter/spay your dog.


Neutering/spaying has many other positive benefits, such as as lower licensing fees, reduced chance for prostrate disorders, and reduced chance for testicular cancer., English bulldogs have weak respiratory systems and have even greater difficulty breathing in hot, humid weather. During the hot season, keep your doggie in air-conditioning. Monitor your dog when it plays outside on hot days to ensure it doesn’t tire itself out.Do not leave your dog in a hot house or car.

, Bulldogs thrive off attention from their owners, and it'll help form a bond that will last as long as your Bulldog lives. Let the dog bond with you.

Gently wipe your bulldog’s folds.,
Pay special attention to your dog’s nose wrinkle.,
Dry your dog’s folds.,
Moisturize as necessary.,
Reward your pet.,
Clean your bulldog’s folds at least twice a week.,
Keep your bulldog at its ideal weight.,
Watch for symptoms of infection.,
Take your dog to the vet.,
Adjust your cleaning routine.",How to Clean a Bulldog's Face Folds," Use a cleanser for dogs, a saline solution, or a simple mix of water and shampoo. The only requirement is that it should be mild and ideally fragrance-free so that it won’t dry out or irritate your bulldog’s skin.If your bulldog is not that dirty or prone to infections, you can simply use water.
If you’re mixing your own solution, combine one part water with one part shampoo. Mild, hypoallergenic shampoos work best.;
, This applicator can be anything from a clean cloth or rag to a makeup pad to a cotton ball. You just need something clean and absorptive that will hold your cleaning solution.For a convenient tool that mixes the solution with the cloth, use baby wipes with aloe.

, You will need a thin towel or cloth to dry out your dog’s folds after you wash them. It should be as clean as possible since you don’t want to rub any dirt or bacteria back into your bulldog’s wrinkles after cleaning them.

, If your bulldog’s folds are prone to dryness, you will want to keep a moisturizer on hand to use at the end of their cleaning. Likewise, if your bulldog’s wrinkles tend to hold in moisture, you’ll want a common astringent, such as baby powder or cornstarch to help them stay dry.In terms of moisturizers, a simple tub of Vaseline, bottle of aloe, or a mild ointment for dog’s skin will do.

, The process will go much faster if you have a still and obedient pet. Be sure they’re settled down and sitting before you attempt to clean them.


Your bulldog is more likely to accept this process and behave while you’re performing it if you start doing it while they’re still a puppy. Once it’s a familiar part of their routine, it won’t seem like a distressing experience.

, You want your cleaning cloth to be damp, not wet, so only add a small amount of solution to it.

, Glide your cleaning tool through and around the crevices of your bulldog’s face and neck. Gently hold open the creases that are difficult to reach with your fingers so that you can clean inside them. Be sure to avoid their eyes to prevent irritation.Don’t scrub or apply much pressure since that can damage your bulldog’s skin or encourage infections by rubbing debris into it.
If your dog also has folds around their tail, you should clean those, too.

, The deep fold that surrounds your bulldog’s nose is the most likely place for them to collect dirt, debris, and microbes. Pay special attention to this pronounced groove when cleaning their face., You don’t want any moisture or soap residue tucked away in your dog’s facial folds since that can lead to discomfort and bacterial infections. Use a clean towel or cloth to wipe away any lingering moisture from your bulldog’s wrinkles.Alternately, you can use a blow dryer on a cool setting to dry out their folds. Hold the folds open, and gently apply the flow of air up and down them until they’re dry.
If your dog’s folds are prone to moisture, you might also consider applying some baby powder or cornstarch to them after washing and drying to ensure that they stay dry.

, If your bulldog’s folds look dry, red, or flaky from frequent washing, try adding a bit of moisturizer to them after drying to help maintain their skin’s balance.You can rub a bit of Vaseline, mild ointment, or aloe in the folds to protect and refresh their skin. Only use a slight amount since you don’t want them to be moist.

, Lavish your pet with a treat and affectionate praise for sitting through their cleaning. Doing so will give them positive associations with getting their face cleaned, which will make it a more pleasant experience for both of you in the future.

, The frequency of cleaning will depend on your pet and the condition of their skin, but it’s best to do it more than once a week.Keep in mind that dogs who are prone to infection or have immune systems compromised by sickness or old age may require more frequent cleanings.
If your dog tends to be sloppy with their food and/or water, you might also want to clean them on a daily rather than weekly basis.

, Obese and overweight dogs have a higher risk of skin infections because their folds are deeper. Monitor your dog’s weight, and consult with your vet about necessary dietary changes if you see any significant increases.Your pet's ideal weight will vary according to its age and sex, but the average adult bulldog should weigh between 22-25 kilograms. Consult with your vet about the ideal weight for your particular pet., When you’re cleaning your bulldog’s folds, be sure to inspect them for signs of infection like rashes, redness, swelling, inflammation, discharge, and/or unpleasant smells., If you notice any symptoms of infection in your bulldog’s wrinkles, make an appointment with your vet. They can prescribe any necessary treatments, such as anti-fungal or antibacterial creams, and advise you about how often you should be cleaning the infected areas., If your bulldog has infected folds, you will need to clean them twice a day rather than twice a week. Swap your cleaning solution for a mild cleanser that contains benzoyl peroxide. Dry their folds completely, and then apply any ointments or other topical treatments, such as diaper rash cream, that your vet recommended.You may also want to clip the fur around your dog’s infected folds so that the skin is easier to access and can stay cleaner.
Be sure to consult with your vet about this routine first to see if it will be effective at treating your dog’s infection.

Start training as early as possible.,
Begin with basic command words.,
Practice the sit command.,
Train your dog to come.,
Teach your dog to heel.,
Be consistent about rules.,
Use discipline only the exact moment you catch your dog doing something wrong.",How to Break a Boxer's Bad Habits1," If you’ve just acquired a Boxer puppy, begin training immediately. Start practicing command words, such as sit and stay, and get your puppy on a set eating and bathroom routine.


Socialize your puppy early by exposing it to other dogs, children, and crowds of people. Let it get used to being around different sights and sounds by taking various routes when you walk it.
Keep training sessions short and try to make them fun when you’re just starting to train a puppy.
Adult dogs are more difficult to train than puppies. It’ll take more persistence and time, but start training your new adult dog as soon as you bring him home.;
, Whether you’re training a puppy or adult dog, you should start with basic commands, such as sit, come, and heel. Break up treats into small pieces to use as rewards. Say the command word, and reward your dog immediately when it follows the command. You’ll have to repeat the process around twenty times when you’re training your dog so the behavior becomes automatic.Training your dog is an important step in breaking bad habits. You have to show your dog that you are the alpha in order to stop it from marking its territory, begging food or stealing scraps, being aggressive, or engaging in other bad behavior.

, To make your dog sit, hold a treat in your hand while standing in front of him. Then, use the treat as a lure to get your dog to sit down. Move the treat over your dog's head in an arc so that he will naturally sit down to keep following the treat with his eyes. As your dog's butt hits the ground, say ""sit"" to mark the behavior. Make sure that you reward your dog with the treat right after he sits as well.


If your dog doesn’t naturally sit, you can place gentle pressure on his bottom to guide him into a seated position.Repeat the process for a few minutes every day and then start to phase out the treat. For example, you might just raise your empty hand in an arc to get your dog to sit, and then reward him with some praise and a belly rub.

, Teach your dog to come by holding position five steps away from it, saying “Come,” and holding a treat out in your hand. When it comes to you, give it the treat and use happy expressions and words to offer positive reinforcement. Repeat the process twenty times, and gradually step back to farther distances., When you walk your dog, make sure it walks beside or slightly behind you. Your dog should not pull the leash or walk uncontrollably in front of you. Say “Heel” when the dog is right beside you as you walk, and give it a treat if it stays there.If it rushes out in front of you, stop walking and wait a minute to reset the routine.
Make sure to offer other forms of positive reinforcement when your dog walks beside you. Say, “Good heel! Good job!” and offer happy expressions.

, If you want to break your Boxer’s bad habits, you need to be consistent about the rules you enforce. For example, if your dog has a problem with chewing, don’t offer it an old shoe or sock and expect it not to go after a newer article of your clothing. Your dog won’t know the difference between old and new shoes.If you don’t want it to beg for table scraps, never offer it human food, and tell your guests not to offer it any food.
In general, never be soft on any of your rules, and don’t make any exceptions. It will just confuse your dog.

, If you come home and find your Boxer went to the bathroom inside or chewed something, don’t yell or discipline it. You’ll only confuse your dog, and it won’t know exactly why you’re yelling.If your dog got into the trash or went to the bathroom inside hours before you discipline it, it won’t be able to make the connection between the bad behavior and your response.
Alternatively, if you see your dog doing something it’s not supposed to, say “Hey!” in an authoritative voice to get its attention, and interrupt it from doing whatever it’s doing."
"
Spay or neuter your dog before it reaches maturity.,
Keep your Boxer on a schedule.,
Clean up urine immediately.,
Offer plenty of positive reinforcement.,
Rule out other bathroom-related problems.",How to Break a Boxer's Bad Habits2," If you have a Boxer puppy or juvenile, consider spaying or neutering it before it becomes fully mature. Intact males are particularly notorious for marking their territory by going to the bathroom where they shouldn’t.If your dog is too old to be spayed or neutered, or if you prefer to leave it intact, you’ll need to double down on training and obedience routines to keep marking at a minimum.
Use regular command word training, especially with your intact male, to show that you’re the alpha and that your house is not the dog’s territory.

, Put your puppy or dog on a strict eating and bathroom schedule as soon as you bring it home. Take it outside first thing in the morning, several times during the day, and a half hour before bed. Feed it in the morning and evening, and take it out for a walk fifteen minutes after it eats.If you have a puppy, you will need to take it outside every 30 minutes for training purposes. Two hours is the maximum time that a puppy can hold its bladder. It is also important for you to praise your puppy after he goes potty outside.
If you have an intact male Boxer, don’t let it mark its territory when you’re out on walks. Say “Hey!” when it raises its leg, or pat its leg down and pull along to get it to continue walking if it doesn't respond to a verbal command. Do your best to only let it relieve itself if it actually needs to use the bathroom, and to look for your permission to go.
Making the dog feel the need to defer to your judgment when using the bathroom will cut down on marking territory indoors or other undesirable places., Use an enzymatic cleaner, such as store-bought pet odor eliminating cleaner, or vinegar and lemon juice. Clean up urine or feces as soon as you notice it, and be on the lookout for urine marks, especially if you have an intact male or puppy. If you ignore or miss a urine stain, your dog will be more likely to remark that spot and continue to use the bathroom inside., When your Boxer uses the bathroom outside, say “Great job! I’m so proud of you!” Use exaggerated, happy expressions, pet it, and use whatever other positive gestures you use to show your dog how happy you are that he’s used the bathroom correctly.All dogs naturally want to please their owners. Positive reinforcement is typically much more effective than yelling or other forms of discipline.

, If your Boxer’s bad bathroom habits seemingly came out of nowhere, it might be suffering from a urinary tract infection or other incontinence issue.If you’re concerned about a possible UTI, take a sample of your dog’s urine to your vet, or ask your vet to take the sample for you.
Ask your vet about anxiety-related causes, especially if your Boxer shows signs of anxiety such as excessive whimpering, keep its tail between its legs, and using the bathroom when the doorbell rings, if you turn the television on, and in response to similar sights and sounds.

"
"
Stop aggressive behavior around food.,
Stop excessive barking.,
Curb bad behavior by increasing your Boxer’s exercise.,
Keep your dog from jumping on people.,
Avoid high-arousal games like tug of war or chasing.,
Consider training classes if your dog is aggressive.",How to Break a Boxer's Bad Habits3," Don’t set your Boxer up for failure: eliminate the opportunity and try not to leave any scraps or easily accessible food unattended.Never give it table scraps or human food, and if you have people over, instruct them not to feed your dog.


Practice extinction conditioning: if your dog begs, ignore it completely. Don’t look or speak to it at all, and be prepared to continue ignoring even if it barks louder or starts to act up. Eventually it will learn that begging won’t result in a reward.Even offering human food to your dog once will teach it that it can beg for food or try to steal food, so avoid getting soft on your rules. If you’re inconsistent and treat it like a lottery system, your dog will just get more persistent.
Consider giving your dog a toy or treat to keep it busy just before you sit down for dinner. If you get through dinner without your dog begging or trying to steal food, reward him afterwards with a treat and positive reinforcement.
Remember that scavenging is a powerful natural instinct, so don’t get too impatient with your dog if you can’t stop it from stealing food. If the problem persists, avoid having any food out in front of it, and consider restricting its access to the kitchen using baby gates.

, When dogs bark at doorbells, knocks, telephone ringing, or other sounds, they typically think they’re doing you a favor by letting you know what’s happening. If your Boxer barks excessively at the doorbell or phone, try training it to go to a designated area whenever it hears that particular sound.First, use command word training to teach it to go to a mat (or another designated area). Say “Mat!” and physically guide it over to the mat, then offer a treat and positive reinforcement. Repeat this process to teach it what the word means. Gradually set the mat farther away from the dog before giving the command as it begins to understand what the word means.
Once you’ve taught your dog how to go to its mat, add the command word to the sound of the doorbell, knock on the door, or phone ringing. Start with the dog away from the mat, give a quiet knock on the door, and say “Mat!” Give your dog a treat if it goes onto the mat.
Use a command word like “Sit” instead of “Mat” if you find it’s easier.
It’ll take some time, but repeat the process at least twenty times. Practice every day, continuing to say “Mat!” in conjunction with the sounds that typically cause your dog to bark.
Eventually, substitute the command word for the sound entirely, and be sure to offer plenty of positive reinforcement when your dog goes to its mat at the sound of the doorbell or knock.

, If your Boxer’s acting up, it might need more exercise. Decide if the behavior seems more playful than aggressive, and make sure it isn’t accompanied by growling, barking, snarling, or showing teeth.


Increasing and varying its exercise if your Boxer is acting up in a non-aggressive way. Just letting a Boxer outside to use the bathroom is not sufficient exercise. It needs one to two hours a day of brisk exercise that involves both physical and mental exertion.Play frisbee with your dog, play fetch, take it swimming, and incorporate command word training into your play, such as having your dog sit before going to fetch a ball or stick.
If your Boxer starts to act up or act aggressively, such as when passing another dog on a walk, redirect its attention. Say “What’s that?” and point in the opposite direction, then continue on your walk. Give the leash a tug to let your dog know it's time to move on, especially if it didn't respond to your verbal command and pointing.

, Boxers are energetic dogs and love to jump, but you should never let your dog jump on you or other people. When your dog jumps, do you best to completely ignore its behavior. Don’t make eye contact, push it off, or touch it.Try to simply step away without making any other acknowledgment.
Your dog doesn’t know what “No get down!” means, and if you push it off, it’ll probably think you’re playing with it.
Not giving your Boxer any attention at all is more of a punishment than yelling or hitting it, and will teach it that jumping is unacceptable behavior.
Consider the amount of exercise it gets and increase or vary if necessary.

, If your Boxer is starting to develop aggressive habits, don’t encourage it with aggressive play. Don’t play games that are high arousal or teach your dog to be possessive with a toy, such as tug of war.All games involving fetching should end with you getting the toy in the end. If your dog won’t drop the stick or ball when you say “Drop!” then stop playing and ignore it.
Don’t harass your Boxer by staring into its eyes for extended amounts of time, abruptly awakening it, hugging it tightly, or placing your arm over its shoulders, which is a sign of dominance and aggression.

, Find a trainer if your dog engages in aggressive behavior and doesn’t respond to command training, ignoring, or other measures you take on your own. Talk to your vet or local humane society about finding a reputable trainer.Find a licensed behaviorist by searching the Animal Behavior Society: http://www.animalbehaviorsociety.org/web/index.php

Ask friends or family for a referral to trainers they might have hired.
Contact your local pet store and ask if they have dog training classes. Ask if they have classes for dogs and their owners so you can learn more about how to curb aggressive behavior.

Select a high-quality dog food.,
Feed your boxer on a regular schedule.,
Provide plenty of fresh water for your boxer.,
Give treats to your boxer.,
Steer clear of danger foods.",How to Care for Boxers1," Choosing an appropriate, high-quality food for your boxer is essential to his health.

Look for a statement that the dog food meets AAFCO (Association of American Feed Control Officials) requirements.Get a food that is appropriate for your boxer’s age. For example, if your boxer is still a puppy, then make sure that you are feeding him puppy food. If your boxer is a senior, then get a senior dog food.;
, It is important to maintain a regular feeding schedule for your boxer. The number of times that you will need to feed your boxer each day depends on his age. For example:puppies between eight to 12 weeks require four meals per day
puppies three to six months old require three meals per day
puppies six months to a year old need two meals per day
dogs older than one year old only need one meal per day, but you may want to feed your boxer two meals per day since most boxers are more prone to bloating, Dogs need to have access to clean, fresh water at all times.Provide a large water bowl for your boxer and change it a couple times per day. Check it now and then to make sure that it is full. You should also wash it once per day to ensure that it is free of bacteria that may make your boxer sick.

Having a veterinarian will make it easier to find help if your boxer ever encounters a serious problem.


Ask about having your boxer spayed or neutered. If you do not plan to breed your boxer, then get your dog spayed or neutered. Spaying and neutering help to keep the pet population down and can also help prevent behavioral problems.
Make sure that your boxer is up to date on vaccinations. Your boxer will need to have vaccinations when he is a puppy and then continue to get boosters to protect him throughout his life., Boxers are more prone than other dogs to certain conditions, so make sure that you watch for signs that something may be wrong. Take your boxer to see a veterinarian right away if you suspect that something is wrong. Some common conditions to watch out for include:Heart defects including boxer cardiomyopathy. Boxer cardiomyopathy can cause an irregular heartbeat, fainting, and shortness of breath. It may also cause sudden death. If you boxer seems lethargic, breathless, or if he faints, then take him to see your veterinarian as soon as possible.Cancer of the skin and other body parts. White boxers are at an even higher risk of developing skin cancer. If you notice any unusual spots or lesions on your boxer’s body, then take him to the vet to have them checked.Eyeball ulceration. This condition results in a deep ulcer of the cornea that causes redness, watery eyes, squinting due to light sensitivity, and discharge. If you notice any of these symptoms, then take your boxer to see a vet right away.Gingival hyperplasia. This condition causes excess gum tissue to grow in the mouth. The tissue may have a lumpy appearance and usually needs to be removed due to the risk of cancer. Take your boxer to see a vet if you notice excess gum tissue in his mouth.Snoring and difficulty breathing. This is due to the boxer’s small nose and pushed in face, which can make it hard to breath. If you notice that your boxer snores or wheezes, then take him to see a veterinarian.

, Boxers have short hair so grooming them is quite easy. You can just brush your boxer a few times per week to keep his coat glossy. As you brush your boxer, check for things like lumps, lesions, or tender spots. Tell your boxer’s veterinarian about anything that you find as these may be signs of a problem.

, Brushing your boxer’s teeth is essential to protect him from gum disease and tartar buildup. Brushing your boxer’s teeth once per day is ideal, but even a couple times per week will help to keep his teeth and gums healthy.Make sure that you get a special dog toothpaste to brush your boxer’s teeth. Do not use human toothpaste for your boxer because the fluoride is toxic to dogs.

, When your boxer wants to sleep, he will need a designated spot to lie down. Make sure that you provide your boxer with soft bedding, such as a dog bed or a couple of folded blankets. Wash your boxer’s bedding once per week to keep it clean.

, If your boxer is not yet house trained, then you will need to put some time and energy into teaching him these habits. Some good things to remember when house training your boxer include:



Maintain a regular schedule for your boxer. Take your boxer outside at set times throughout the day, such as first thing and after he eats his meals. Your boxer should have a chance to go potty about once every two hours.

Designate a spot in the yard for going potty. Decide on a patch of grass in your yard and take your boxer to that spot every time you let him out.

Praise your boxer for going outside. Give your boxer some praise and a treat for going potty outside.

Do not punish your boxer for going potty inside. If you notice that your boxer urinates or defecates inside the house, do not hit, yell at, or otherwise punish your boxer. Just clean up the mess and take your boxer outside.

Watch your boxer for signs that he has to go. If you notice that you boxer is pacing or acting like he has to go, then take him outside right away. You may even want to keep your boxer on a leash when you are home in order to be able to monitor him and take him out as needed., Crate training can be an effective way to provide your boxer with a safe space to retreat to if he becomes overwhelmed or just needs a bit of down time. You can also use a crate to house train your boxer or to prevent him from chewing on furniture. If you decide to crate train your boxer, keep some things in mind.


A crate should never be used as a way to punish your boxer or it will not be an effective training device. The crate should be a safe, pleasant place for your dog.
Your boxer’s crate should be large enough for him to stand up, turn around, and lay down comfortably. It should not be too small or too big.
The crate should have some soft bedding, such as a towel or blanket. Keeping a favorite toy in your boxer’s crate is also a good idea.

Monitor for excessive panting.,
Watch for any coughing.,
Check for physical limitations.,
Look for any discomfort.,
Check for any signs of respiratory distress.,
Know that all bulldogs are prone to respiratory problems.",How to Diagnose Respiratory Problems in Bulldogs1," One of the main signs of respiratory problems for your bulldog is excessive panting. This means your dog will pant more than is normal or in situations where he shouldn’t be panting. He may be taking rapid shallow breaths.You may see his tongue hanging out, and he may have drool or saliva hanging from the jowls.;
, Your bulldog may exhibit other breathing issues in addition to panting. He may start coughing a lot. He also may start hacking, like he can’t get enough air or has something stuck in his throat.Your bulldog also may start to choke due to the coughing or lack of air.
Your bulldog may also snort or make snoring sounds when breathing.

, Because of the bulldog’s breathing problems, he may be unable to perform the same kind of physical activities that other dogs can. Heavy or excessive exercise may cause him to pant excessively. He may also just be unable to perform any physical activity at all.Your dog may show more physical limitations in hot, humid weather.

, Your dog may exhibit symptoms of discomfort due to his trouble breathing. Your dog may have a tense or worried expression on his face. He may also hold his head low with the neck straight. He also may refuse food.Your dog may also be reluctant to move or walk.
Your dog may also sit with the elbows held away from the body.

, Your dog’s trouble breathing may lead to some more serious symptoms. Your dog may have a blue tinge to the normally pink membranes in the mouth. This is evidence that he is having trouble getting oxygen.Due to this distress, your dog may collapse with heavy breathing.

, Bulldogs are a breed considered brachycephalic. This means that the dog has a shortened head, and therefore, nasal passage. This causes bulldogs to have their signature smushed in face. However, this also leads to a life of respiratory problems.The respiratory problems that affect the bulldog is referred to bracycephalic respiratory syndrome. This refers to the general respiratory problems that bulldogs have due to their upper airway abnormalities.
Almost every bulldog suffers from some symptoms of bracycephalic respiratory syndrome. This means that monitoring for the following symptoms is especially important to protect your dog.

"
"
Take your dog to the vet.,
Check the dog’s nose and throat.,
Get other tests.",How to Diagnose Respiratory Problems in Bulldogs2," If you see any or all of the symptoms of respiratory distress, then do not move your dog, except to carry him to the vet. The vet will examine the dog and listen to his chest with a stethoscope. This helps decide if the problem is in the chest or the upper airway.


If the dog is severely distressed, the vet may give the dog treatment to stabilize his breathing and put him in an oxygen tent until he is out of danger., A visualize inspection can tell the vet about the dog's nostrils. Opening his mouth can show the vet if the mouth is crowded with tongue and soft palate that are blocking the back of the throat.Your vet will probably press on the windpipe to get your dog to cough. He may also check the gums to look for discoloration to check for a lack of oxygen.
Getting a clear view of the back of the throat requires an anesthetic. The vet then uses a laryngoscope to examine the soft palate, size of the tonsils, and how crowded the throat area is.

, The vet may do a blood test to determine if there are any underlying conditions that may be causing any respiratory distress, like infections. If your bulldog has an underlying infection, it may aggravate and worsen respiratory symptoms. In some cases, the vet may need to perform imaging tests to diagnose your bulldog. A CT scan or x-ray can visualize the size of the windpipe to check if it is too narrow or not.Your vet may also do an ultrasound to check the lungs and heart.

Be prepared for when your dog has respiratory difficulties.,
Reduce your dog’s respiratory distress.,
Recognize the respiratory problems a bulldog faces.",How to Diagnose Respiratory Problems in Bulldogs3," If you own a bulldog, you should be alert to the signs of breathing difficulty. When your dog faces any respiratory troubles, you will need to take steps to calm your dog and rest him so that his need for oxygen is less.When you see that your dog has respiratory distress, stop him from any physical activity immediately. Keep him calm so you can try to regulate his breathing.
If you are outside, take your dog inside. If you can’t get inside quickly, get your dog into a cooler, shaded area.
Place cool wet rags on your dog to help lower his body temperature.

, Since all bulldogs are at risk for respiratory problems, you can do things for your bulldog to help reduce the likelihood of him experiencing respiratory distress. One of the main things you can do is regulate your dog’s weight.Being obese can put major stress on your dog’s respiratory system, causing breathing problems. Weight loss is one of the most common treatments to help respiratory problems in bulldogs.Limit your dog’s heavy exercise and his excitability. These things lead to fast breathing and panting, which is more difficult for your bulldog.
Keep your bulldog out of the heat. Excessive heat can worsen his breathing problems., One of the major problems for bulldogs is that the structure of the skull is made up of bone and soft tissue, and the size of the nose is reduced and flattened in this breed. Although bone is shortened, the soft tissue structures in the mouth, such as the tongue and soft palate, remain the same size as before. Due to this structure, the structural problems suffered by bulldogs include:Narrow nostrils. The nostrils of the bulldog are often narrow and either completely closed or mere slits, instead of having nice wide open nostrils like other breeds.
Compressed nasal passages. The shortened bony case of the nose means the dog lacks the normal filtering mechanism of the nasal turbinates. Filtering serves to warm cold air when it's breathed in and to filter out dust.
Long soft palate. A fleshy shelf called the soft palate divides the nose from the mouth. Given the shortened nature of the dog's nose and mouth, the soft palate takes up more room than it should and tends to block the entrance to the windpipe, causing choking episodes from time to time.
Large tonsils. The dog's tonsils tend to enlarge to cope with the unfiltered area. The tonsils sit in the throat just above the entrance to the windpipe. When they are enlarged, they can restrict airflow into the windpipe.
Narrow windpipes. Bulldogs have a syndrome where the windpipe has a narrower diameter, again making it hard to breath.

Give your dog time to digest its food before exercising it.,
Comb or brush your collie every day.,
Be vigilant about brushing during shedding season.,
Check your dog's body on a regular basis.,
Give consistent training.,
Use a positive-reinforcement method of training.,
Teach your dog a variety of skills and tricks.,
Play with your collie.",How to Care for Collies," The collie is a medium-sized dog that originated in Scotland, where they were used to herd sheep. Their heritage as working dogs means they have a lot of endurance and a lot of energy. This means that only giving a collie a quick walk around the block will leave a collie feeling bored and frustrated.


The ideal Collie owner is interested in an interactive relationship with their dog, training the pet to a high level of obedience, and participating in activities such as agility or obedience trials.
A collie owner should be active and have the time to give their dog a lot of physical activity every single day. If a collie is not mentally stimulated and given a lot of physical activity it will become bored and neurotic. This could result in bad behavior, such as barking for no reason.;
, Collies do make great family dogs but need to be treated with respect. If you have very small children, you may want to consider a different breed. If a small child is too rough and tumble with a collie, the animal may become fearful and bite out of fear.

, The Collie breed is prone to certain genetic health problems, especially hip dysplasia and eye problems. If getting your dog from a breeder, choose one that screens the parent dogs for these problems. Make sure the breeder breeds from dogs with low hip scores and that passed a screening eye test with a veterinary ophthalmologist.


The breeder should be able to produce certificates which prove both the mother and father were screened and are at low risk of passing on diseases such as CEA (Collie eye anomaly) and GPRA (generalized progressive retinal atrophy) which lead to blindness in young dogs.
Screening an adult dog is not a guarantee the puppies will definitely be free of disease, but it is a good start. The other side of the coin is that parents that are affected by hip dysplasia or CEA are highly likely to breed pups that are also affected.

, Make sure they are socializing all of their dogs regularly. This will help assure that your puppy becomes a confident well-adjusted adult dog. The breeder should expose the dog to many different people and situations beginning around 3 - 4 weeks of age. The young dogs should meet people of different heights, appearances, and tones of voice.


The puppies should not be exclusively reared in a kennel, as this isolates them from the normal sights, sounds, and activities of a regular life. This will make it more difficult for the dog to adjust to family life.
Never, ever buy a puppy from a puppy mill. One sign you have come across a bad breeder is that the breeder will not let you see the mother. This is because the mother has been taken away from the puppy far too early and is no longer interacting with the puppy at all.

, Your puppy will need vaccinating against various canine infectious diseases. Your veterinarian will let you know which are important in your area. These could include distemper, parvovirus, canine adenovirus, leptospirosis, infectious canine hepatitis, parainfluenza virus, Lyme disease, and rabies (which is required in most municipalities).


Rabies vaccine is given the first time after 12 weeks of age and then repeated every 1 to 3 years.
Other vaccines are usually given in three doses 3 - 4 weeks apart, with the final dose given around 16 weeks of age.Veterinarians try to wait until a puppy is a few months old to give vaccinations. When a puppy is born it is given certain immunities from its mother. The puppy should be given the time for these immunities to work before it is given vaccinations.
Remember to get your dog its yearly booster injections as well!

, An active dog like a collie is bound to spend a lot of time outdoors. This makes deworming and parasite treatment very important. These medications come in a wide variety of forms and each product has a slightly different spectrum of activity. Ask your vet which are best for your pet.


A basic worming regime is against roundworms (monthly) with a quarterly broad spectrum wormer against whipworms and tapeworms. If your collie is regularly eating carcasses then a monthly broad spectrum wormer is best.
Treatment against heartworm is also advisable, either as a six-monthly injection, or a monthly spot-on treatment at home.
Fleas are unpleasant and can cause skin allergies and infections. Another common parasite are ticks, which also carry unpleasant diseases such as Lyme's disease or tick borne fever. Prevention is better than cure, so this involves using a product effective against fleas and ticks, such as fipronil (Frontline or Effipro) or the Seresto collar.

, Collies are over sensitive to some drugs, of which ivermectin, an anti-parasitic, is the best known. There are now many excellent drugs available that eliminate parasites just as well as ivermectin. Its use should be avoided entirely.


Your vet will take care to prescribe accurate doses of the anti-parasite treatments that come from the same family of drugs as ivermectin. When used correctly and within the recommended dose range these are safe., You want to avoid accidental breeding. You should discuss spaying and neutering with your veterinarian. Usually females are operated on from 4 - 6 months of age, and males from around 6 -10 months of age, however your veterinary clinic may differ.


Desexing has an additional benefit for female dogs. Rates of mammary cancer in female dogs are much lower in female dogs that have been fixed. To benefit from this lowered risk, the surgery needs to be performed before the bitch's second heat.

, Meat should be the first and second ingredients in any good dog food. Fillers, such as corn, do not give your dog the nutrition it needs to be healthy.An active adult collie that is burning a lot of energy should be fed twice a day. It may be difficult for the dog to consume enough calories in one sitting.

, This is simply a base line to start from. You need to keep an eye on your dog's weight to assess whether the amount of food you are feeding it is enough, or too much.


You should also become familiar with condition scoring your collie. This is a way of assessing your dog's weight by looking at its physique, not a scale. By comparing its body shape to the ideal, you will have a good idea of what a healthy body shape is for your dog. A dog in good body condition should have a waist line when viewed from above or the side. You should be able to feel its ribs easily, but without the ribs standing out through the skin.

, You need to wait at least 90 minutes after a meal for exercise. If you don't, there is a risk of the dog's stomach flipping over and becoming twisted, which is a life-threatening condition called bloat., Collies have a long soft coat, which can become knotted. This is especially important if the dog is outdoors a lot and gets stuff tangled in its fur.


Brushing your dog will also help you decrease the amount of fur released in your home.

, Collies shed seasonally and will release a ton of hair once a year, usually the late summer or during heat in female dogs. During this period you will need to be on top of brushing and cleaning up dog hair or it will become a total mess.Comb the dog through daily, and brush out dead fur at least once a week., It's best check your dog over after each walk. Look for grass awns that may be lodged in fur around the ears or paws. Also look for ticks that may have attached themselves to your dog. Both of these problems, awns and ticks, can be life threatening for your dog.

, Be sure to train your collie dog and work with them everyday. To start with, if your dog can concentrate long enough, do two 10 - 20 minute training sessions per day. Start with the basics of sit and stay and build up to more complex obedience training and tricks. The thing about collies is that they love to learn and will enjoy the one-to-one attention of training throughout their life., Collies respond well to clicker training and also to dog whistles. Learn how to clicker train your dog to unlock the full potential of your collie's abilities. The basic principal of clicker training is that the dog learns to link the sound of the click-clack of the clicker to a reward. You mark the instant a desired behavior happens with a click-clack so the dog understands what action is being rewarded.

, You can use the clicker or a whistle to build up all manner of tricks. To do this, break each trick down into it's constituent parts and teach one step at a time. For example, you might train the dog to fetch a toy and drop it in a bucket. The first step is teaching the dog to hold the desired toy. Then you teach the dog to pick the toy up from the floor and hold the toy. Then you teach the dog to pick up the toy, hold it, and then drop the toy. Then you teach the dog to pick up the toy, hold it, and then drop the toy in a bucket


Another great trick with Collies that has been used by shepherds for generations, is to teach them ""Left"" and ""right"", ""drop"" and ""come"". This unlocks their potential to herd animals together. This is best taught with a whistle. Decide on your key command signals, for example one short blast means ""Left"", and one long blast means ""right,"", two short beeps mean ""drop"" and two long blasts means ""come."" Teach each signal by teaching one command at a time, and moving on to the next when the first is firmly established.
For example, use a clicker to teach ""Left"" by rewarding the dog with a treat every time it turns its head to the left. Once the dog is regularly turning its head deliberately to the left to earn a reward, add in your cue signal of a short blast on the whistle. Continue to reinforce this with numerous repetitions, then start just giving the whistle signal, followed by a reward for the correct action., Fetch is a great game to play with your collie, as it feeds into their instinct to chase after things and bring them back. Key to this play is teaching the dog to give you the toy by exchanging it for a low value treat.

Place a collar with an ID tag on your sheltie.,
Take your sheltie for regular veterinary check-ups.,
Spay or neuter your sheltie.,
Learn about breed-specific diseases.",How to Care for Shelties1," Shelties are fast runners and if your dog ever gets loose, she might be hard to catch or even get lost. To make it easier for people to return your sheltie to you if she gets lost, make sure that she is always wearing a collar and an ID tag that provide your contact information (address and phone number).


You may also want to get your sheltie implanted with a microchip so that she will be identifiable without her collar as well.;
, When you first get your sheltie, it is important to take her to see a veterinarian as soon as possible for a routine exam. Annual exams are a great way to keep your sheltie in good health. Your sheltie will also need to get medicine and vaccinations for:


Heartworm
Fleas and ticks
Lyme disease
Rabies

, If you do not plan to breed your sheltie, then you should have your dog spayed or neutered. Spaying and neutering will prevent your dog from becoming pregnant or impregnating another dog. It may also help to protect your dog against behavior issues and certain diseases and infections.Spayed female dogs may be protected from certain types of cancer and uterine infections.
Spaying and neutering also helps to prevent roaming, aggression, and other hormonal behavior problems., Although most shelties will live healthy lives with proper care, the breed is more prone to a few conditions. It is good to be aware of these conditions so that you know what measure you can take to detect or even prevent them. These conditions include:



Patent ductus arteriosus. This is a heart defect that can show up early in life. Some cases of this condition can be corrected by surgery, but others cannot be treated and the dog may need to be euthanized.

Deafness. Shelties that have a blue merle hair coat may be more likely to develop deafness. If you notice that your sheltie is not responding to you when you call, then take her to see your veterinarian.

Dermatomyositis. This is an inherited inflammatory disease that affects the skin, muscles, and blood vessels. This disease may be present in puppies as young as four months old. Your veterinarian can provide medication to control some of the symptoms, but sometimes euthanasia is the only option if the disease progresses. There is no way to screen for this disease.Hip dysplasia. With this condition, the bones that form the hip (the thigh bone and pelvis) create a shallow socket and this may lead to arthritis and lameness. If your dog has hip dysplasia, then he will probably have trouble walking. Surgery may correct this disorder, but not always.

Cryptorchism or undescended testicles. If your dog has undescended testicles, then they will need to be removed.

Lupus Erythematosus. This condition is a multi-systemic disease that affects the skin, muscles, kidneys, joints, and muscles. Your veterinarian can provide medication to help control symptoms, but there is no cure."

Purchase the necessities.,
Groom your Collie.,
Ensure your dog gets plenty of exercise.,
Give your Border Collie quality veterinary care.,
Purchase a microchip for your dog.,
Choose quality food.,
Have fun with your Border Collie.",How to Care for a Border Collie1," There are quite a few basic essentials you'll need to buy for your Border Collie so that it will have everything it needs at your home. You should purchase a leash, collar, dog food, food and water dishes, toys, a crate, and a dog hairbrush.The leash should be an appropriate length for your Border Collie, and comfortable for you and your dog. This means that it should be long enough to allow your energetic Collie some freedom of movement, but short enough to still maintain control over your dog.
Avoid retractable leashes as these may encourage your dog to pull. Instead, opt for a long line leash while training your Collie and getting to know their personality better.
The collar must have an ID tag with your phone number and/or address on it.
The food and water dishes should be stainless steel if possible.
Purchase ""indestructible"" dog toys such as Kong brand toys. Since Collies tend to vigorously chew their toys, this kind will last longer (though most will be destroyed eventually) than stuffed toys or dainty rubber squeaky toys.If you want to crate train your Border Collie, be sure to get a crate that is big enough for your pup. The recommended crate size is typically 36 in (91 cm) x 30 in (76 cm).;
, Border Collies have long, beautiful coats that require a bit of maintenance. You’ll need to brush them regularly (at least once a week) and give them a bath every 4-8 weeks to help keep their coat clean and healthy.Be sure to purchase grooming tools, especially those appropriate for long-haired dogs. This includes a dog hair brush, hair comb, and nail clippers.
Trim their nails once every 4-6 weeks.

, Because of Border Collies' enormous amounts of energy, at least an hour of exercise every day is a requirement. A daily walk is necessary. And it is preferred to let your Collie run around freely if you have a big fenced in yard.You can also burn off energy in more engaging ways such as competing in dog sports like Agility or Flyball, hiking, swimming, or visiting dog parks.

, Though it can seem expensive to take your Collie to the vet, it really is in their best interest and it will save you money down the road. Give your puppy vaccinations. These are absolutely necessary for their health; consult your veterinarian for information on required vaccinations and appropriate ages at which to give them.You should also take your Border Collie in for annual veterinarian checkups once they reach adulthood.
Some common medical conditions Border Collies suffer from include hip dysplasia and several eye/cornea disorders.Fix (spay or neuter) your dog. This is a relatively simple operation that will help stop or prevent bad behavior, accidental litters, and certain health issues., A microchip is a very small device that stores your contact information so that if your Collie escapes, the shelter or another vet can scan it and contact you to reunite you with your lost pet. Because of Border Collies' intelligence and agility, the chances of your dog escaping is high enough that a microchip is a useful precaution.Microchips are relatively inexpensive and can be implanted by your veterinarian.
Vets usually prefer to implant microchips at the same time as another procedure (like spaying or neutering) to kill two birds with one stone and avoid putting your pet through any additional discomfort.

, Avoid cheap or ""bargain"" foods – these can lead to health issues down the road like obesity, dental problems, or even kidney disease. Good food is a necessity for your dog, especially a high energy dog like a Border Collie.Don’t choose cheap food brands with grain by-products (corn, cornmeal, wheat, etc.) as the first listed ingredient.
Instead, feed your dog high-quality foods with meat as the main ingredient. Look for foods that contain meat, poultry, or fist as the first listed ingredient.Use the serving sizes outlined on the food package as a guideline for how much to feed your dog. Check your dog's body each week, and slightly adjust the amount of food you provide if you notice them unhealthily gaining or losing weight., It might need an hour and a half of exercise every day, shred your expensive shoes, herd the neighborhood children, or otherwise make a menace of itself, but one thing is for certain: if you're a responsible and educated owner, your Border Collie will be your best friend.


Border Collies are typically great around children and other pets, especially if they have been raised around them. They might be a bit hesitant around strangers.

Choose a high-quality food for medium sized dogs.,
Determine how much food to give your sheltie every day.,
Develop a regular feeding schedule.,
Consider your sheltie’s age.,
Provide plenty of fresh clean water.,
Give your sheltie some healthy treats.,
Steer clear of foods that are toxic to your sheltie.",How to Care for Shelties2," To stay healthy, your sheltie will need a high-quality dog food meant for medium sized dogs. One easy way to check the quality of a dog food is to read the ingredients on the label. If the label lists meat as the first and second ingredient (not a meat by-product or grain), then it is probably a high-quality food.


You can also ask your dog’s breeder or veterinarian for recommendations if you are not sure what type of food to feed your sheltie.

, Dog food packages provide a range for how much to feed your dog, but this is often a wide range. You will need to know how much your dog weighs and consider his activity level as well.For example, if your dog food package recommends feeding your sheltie two to four cups of food per day and your dog is very active, then you may need to give him the full four cups each day. But if your dog is sedentary, then you may only need to feed him two cups of food per day.

, It will be easier to house train you sheltie if you have a solid feeding schedule for her. You can develop a feeding schedule for your sheltie based on how much food she needs to eat each day.


For example, if your sheltie requires two cups of food every day, then you may want to split this amount into two meals. You could give one meal at 7:00am and give the other meal at 6:00pm.

, Adult dogs can eat just one or two big meals per day. If your sheltie is still a puppy, then she will need to be fed more often. If your sheltie puppy is:


eight to 12 weeks, then do four meals per day
three to six months, then do three meals per day
six months to one year old, then do two meals per day, Your sheltie needs to have access to a large bowl of fresh clean water at all times.Make sure that you clean and replenish your sheltie's water bowl at least once per day. If your sheltie has been running around a lot or if the weather is warm, then you may need to refill your sheltie's water more often.

, Dog obesity is a major cause of health problems, so it is important to make sure that your dog does not overeat. However, your sheltie will still appreciate a treat now and then, so try these nutritious, low-calorie foods:


baby carrots
cooked green beans
cooked sweet potatoes
cooked peas
blueberries
banana slices, Some foods can make your dog sick or even kill her. Foods to avoid feeding your sheltie include:avocados
alcohol
caffeine
chocolate
grapes
raisins
nuts
onions, garlic, and chives
raw meat, bones, or eggs
salty foods
yeast dough
xylitol (often found in sugar free foods)"

Know that any dog can be loyal, or disloyal.,
Look for easily trained breeds.,
Find an affectionate dog.,
Be cautious about difficult breeds.,
Think twice about aggressive breeds.,
Talk to a professional.",How to Choose a Dog Breed Bred for Loyalty1," Although different dog breeds have certain characteristics and traits, each individual dog has its own personality and the potential to be loyal or disloyal.In large part, a dog’s loyalty to its owner is determined by how the owner treats the dog. If you care for your dog and show it love and affection, it will likely form a strong bond with you regardless of the breed.Some dogs that are considered loyal include the bullmastiff, the Doberman pinscher, the giant schnauzer, the Akita, the German shepherd, the Rottweiler, and the Chihuahua. However, there is not consensus on what breeds are particularly loyal.
It is also important to remember that a dog from a loyal breed can develop behavioral problems and become disloyal. A breed’s characteristic is not a guarantee of certain behaviors.;
, Some dog breeds have a reputation for being particularly easy to train. Dogs in these breeds tend to be very smart and accommodating to human commands. Dogs that are less stubborn and more receptive to training will bond with their owners more easily, which is essential for developing loyalty.Dog breeds that are more receptive to training include Akita, German shepherd, and golden retriever.

, Some breeds are known for being overly affectionate dogs. These animals form close bonds with their owners and are considered loyal. However, some of these breeds, such as the pit bull, also have a reputation for being aggressive towards humans and other animals.More affectionate dogs include various breeds of terriers, the Shar-Pei, and the Akita.

, Some dogs are simply hard to train and require a lot of attention, which can make them difficult to bond with. Some breeds are stubborn and difficult to train, which can make forming a good bond difficult. Others require a lot of physical activity that, if not met, can result in behavioral problems.Dogs like the husky or the beagle can be hard to train.
German shepherds, the Akita, and Doberman pinschers need a lot of physical activity.

, Certain types of dog have been bred exclusively for their abilities to hunt game, protect their owners, and fight other dogs and animals. Dogs in these breeds are more inclined to exhibit aggressive behavior towards other animals and people. Unfortunately, many notably aggressive breeds are also known for their loyalty.Dogs with a history of violence include Rottweiler’s, mastiffs, pit bulls, and Doberman pinscher.
It is important to remember that, with the proper training, a dog from an aggressive breed can be a safe and loving member of any household.

, Talking to someone who is an expert on dogs may help you get a better idea of what breeds to look for. Talk to your veterinarian, a dog breeder, a trainer, or a behaviorist about which breeds are the most loyal. These professionals should be able to point you in the right direction.


You might ask a veterinarian questions like “Which dog breed do you think is the most loyal?” or “What dog breeds should I avoid?”
If you already have a veterinarian, you should talk with them about which breeds will get along well with your other animals.
Ask the breeder questions like “In your experience, what breeds are the most loyal?” or “Are your dogs particularly loyal?”

"
"
Try to train the dog yourself.,
Take your Collie to a professional trainer.,
Expand your education.",How to Care for a Border Collie2," It is important to start training your dog early so that they understand what you want from them from the beginning. Start with showing them what kind of behavior you want and then reinforcing this behavior with treats and praise.Though you can start teaching simple concepts (e.g., housebreaking, sleeping in crate, not jumping/biting/dominating people) to young puppies using positive reinforcement, training more advanced obedience is only recommended for puppies four months and older.

, For a high energy dog like a Collie, obedience training is essential. Not only will it provide essential stimulation for your BC, it will also make your life with an extremely energetic, mischievous dog somewhat easier. A professional trainer will be able to your dog with obedience training so that it will be easier for you to continue the training at home.Border Collies are intelligent dogs and often respond best to training techniques in which they can think problems out for themselves, such as clicker training.

, Read books on Border Collies, join an Obedience/Agility group, or talk with experienced BC owners. Do anything to learn more about your beloved pup and what you can do to make their life healthier and happier. Learn about dog nutrition and how important exercise is for your dog’s wellbeing.Consult your veterinarian if you have questions about your Border Collie.

"
"
Consider carefully.,
Choose where to purchase your Border Collie.,
Interact with many dogs before making a choice.",How to Care for a Border Collie3," Border Collies (also known as BCs) exceed almost every other dog breed in intelligence and energy, and are only good matches for responsible, dedicated, informed, and experienced dog owners. Never buy a Border Collie because of their cute appearance, or because your friend has a really nice one. And always dedicate a large amount of research time before purchasing or adopting a Collie.Border Collies are high energy and require a lot of exercise and room to roam freely. They don’t do well in apartments or confined spaces. They really need a large yard or some land to roam around., Responsible breeders are the best source for those who desire a show or competition dog; however, if you are interested simply in a quality pet, consider adopting from a specialized breed rescue. This will allow you to give a home to a dog in need while still getting the breed that you want.You can sometimes buy a Border Collie from a pet store. But this is not really recommended, as you will generally have no idea of the puppy's health, breeding, or history, and will most likely be supporting a puppy mill.
You could also consider buying from a ""backyard,"" or casual, breeder. This is also unadvised for the lack of information you will receive about the dog.
Consider adopting from a shelter. This is a preferred route for those wishing to help dogs in need. But this is often unadvised due to the lack of information and because shelters are often unable to provide for the Border Collies’ special needs, resulting in a badly behaved dog. Adopting from a breed-specific rescue, however, is a reasonable and kind way to acquire your dog.

, Once you have found some Border Collies, go meet them and see if you like any of them. Remember that this is a big decision and you shouldn’t make it lightly.Never adopt a dog sight unseen, no matter how cute it may seem in pictures. You need to interact with the dog in person and make sure there is a connection between you two. You also need to make sure the dog seems healthy.
Consider bringing your other family members to meet your potential new dog. It is important to gauge how the dog will interact with the whole family.
You may also want to bring any existing pets to make sure they will get along. You don’t want to accidentally create a situation in which none of your animals can coexist together.

"
"
Conduct a thorough online search.,
Visit organizations you may want to work with.,
Ask agency staff lots of questions.,
Contact organizations you are not able to visit.,
Ensure that an organization is licensed and registered.,
Consider the organization’s adoption fees.",How to Choose a Dog Adoption Agency1," You can find a list of local animal shelters and adoption agencies online. For example, visit the Shelter Pet Project website and enter your zip code to find the organizations in your area that can help you find and adopt a dog from a reputable source. The ASPCA also offers a free online search tool to help find adoptable pets. Other useful websites include Petfinder, WorldAnimal, and AdoptAPet.Visit adoption agencies' websites and look for information like regular adoption events.
Read third-party reviews of the agencies you’re interested in as well, on sites like Google or Yelp. Feel free to call a vet in an agency's area to see if they are familiar with the organization.;
, If there is an adoption facility that you’re interested in in your area, visit them. Aside from meeting the dogs that they have available, you’ll be able to learn about the agency by paying them a visit.Pay attention to the facilities cleanliness and organization, as well as the condition of the dogs you get to meet. Do the dogs appear healthy and happy?
Further, observe the staff. They should be experienced and willing to you help.

, Asking questions is the best way to learn more about an agency, as well as the experience level of its staff. Listen to signs that the staff is knowledgeable about the agency's policies.In particular, ask questions like, “How many adoptions to you complete annually?” and “What is your spay/neuter and immunization policy?”
Look for evidence that the staff care about the dogs they work with. In fact, they should ask you questions as well, to make sure you'll be able to care for a dog properly.

, Find the contact information for a particular agency that has a dog you found online and give them a call. Courteous, timely responses should always be expected to any questions you have, whether on the phone or via email.If the organization operates exclusively or heavily through foster homes, ask questions like, “How many dogs do you currently have available?” and “How many foster homes do you work with?”
The ratio between these numbers shouldn’t be more than a few dogs per foster home.

, If an adoption agency claims to be a nonprofit, verify this claim. Either way, ask to see the organization’s kenneling license whenever you visit a facility where dogs are housed.Unfortunately, some animal adoption agencies do not follow ethical animal treatment or business practices. Valid licenses and registration indicate that an organization is regularly inspected and meets the legal criteria to operate an adoption agency.
If you have any reservations about how animals are treated by a particular agency, ask a staff member directly. Say something like, ""How much are individual dog's fed each day?"" or ""What disciplinary tactics do you use with the dogs?""
If you ever witness or suspect animal abuse, do not hesitate to contact law enforcement officials in your area.

, Another important factor is the cost of an adoption with a particular agency. While it may seem odd to pay a fee to a rescue facility or animal shelter, keep in mind that the organization has likely covered significant costs that you will not have to pay. Ultimately, adoption fees are often much cheaper than paying for the fees and services that would otherwise be necessary to acquire and care for a dog.Note that private breeders often charge hundreds of dollars for a dog that still needs to be immunized and fixed.
Even a “free” puppy from your neighbor might end up costing you more than the adoption fees at your local shelter once you get the necessary veterinary care.
In short, expect adoption fees to range between $75 and $225, well below the cost of providing a dog with basic initial veterinary services.

Groom your sheltie’s fur.,
Clean and inspect your sheltie's ears regularly.,
Trim your sheltie’s nails.,
Clean your sheltie’s teeth.",How to Care for Shelties3," Shelties have long fur that will become matted if not properly cared for, so make sure that you set aside an hour or two to groom your sheltie’s fur every week. To groom your sheltie, you will need a pin brush, metal comb, and grooming rake.Use the pin brush to go over your sheltie’s back and sides. Try spritzing some leave in conditioner (for dogs) to help control static and reduce tangles as you brush.
Use the metal comb to break up tangles and mats. You can sue the metal comb to help you break through any tangles or mats in your sheltie’s fur. Just make sure that you go slowly if you encounter any tangles or you may hurt your dog.
Use the grooming rake to go over your sheltie’s undercoat. This area may easily become matted if not brushed regularly, so make sure that you give special attention to this area.

, Checking and cleaning your sheltie’s ears is an important part of your grooming routine. Your sheltie’s ears may get dirty or waxy now and then, so it is up to you to keep them clean.


To clean your sheltie’s ears, wrap a small piece of damp cotton gauze around your index finger and use it to clean the inside of your sheltie’s ears. Do not stick the gauze further into your sheltie’s ear than your finger will fit and never use cotton swabs on your dogs ears.If you notice any bad smells, discharge, or wax buildup, then take your sheltie to see your veterinarian.

, Your sheltie will need to have her nails trimmed when they start to get too long. If your sheltie is very active, then she may wear her nails down on her own, but most dogs need a trim every couple of months.


Make sure that you use a guillotine style nail trimmer and trim only a little of the nail at a time. Otherwise, you may end up hitting the quick (a sensitive blood vessel inside of your dog’s nail) and this can cause your sheltie a lot of pain.
To avoid the quick, trim a tiny sliver of your sheltie’s nail at a time and check the trimmed surface as you go. If you start to see a circle on top of the trimmed surface, stop cutting. The quick is near this circle., Regular tooth brushing can also help to keep your sheltie in good health. To brush your sheltie’s teeth, you will need to get a special dog toothbrush and toothpaste. Do not use human toothpaste because this will make your sheltie sick."
"
Give your sheltie a job.,
Talk back to your sheltie.,
Provide your sheltie with stimulating toys.,
Make sure that your sheltie has room to run and play.,
Consider crate training your sheltie.,
Teach your sheltie basic commands.,
Socialize your sheltie.",How to Care for Shelties4," Shelties have a history as working dogs, so they enjoy having responsibilities.Try to find ways to involve your sheltie in your chores and other activities.


For example, you might have your sheltie wear a light backpack when you go on walks so that he can carry your keys and water bottle. Or, you might train your sheltie to retrieve times for you when you are doing yard work.

, Shelties are social dogs that often “talk” to their owners.If your sheltie barks at you, talk back and try to get to the bottom of what she is trying to ask or tell you. She may need to go out, need to be fed, or just want some attention.


Never punish your sheltie for barking. If you are bothered by your sheltie’s barking, then consider using positive reinforcement to get her to stop barking so much.

, Shelties are smart dogs, so they will need plenty of mental stimulation. Make sure that your sheltie always has some fun toys to keep her entertained. Some good toys to give your sheltie include:


puzzle toys
chew toys
squeaky toys
rope toys

, Shelties enjoy running around for exercise, so make sure that your sheltie has opportunities to patrol the yard or your neighborhood. Try taking your sheltie for a couple of short walks around the neighborhood with you every day.


Always keep your sheltie on a leash or inside of a closed yard when she is outside. It is also a good idea to supervise your sheltie when she is outside so that you know that she is safe.

, Crate training your sheltie can help to teach her that certain items are off limits and it is also a good way to house train your sheltie. If you decide to crate train your sheltie, keep in mind that her crate should be large enough for her to stand up, lay down, and turn around in. It should not be any larger than this.


Make your sheltie’s crate appealing by placing some comfortable bedding and a toy inside of it.
Leave your sheltie’s crate open for the first week or two after you get it. The goal is for your sheltie to want to go into her crate and feel safe when she does so.
Never shut a sheltie puppy in a crate for more than a couple of hours. Puppies cannot hold their bladders for long and they will end up soiling the crate.
Never use a crate as a way to punish your sheltie. Your sheltie should like to go into her crate, not fear it., Teaching basic commands to your sheltie will help to ensure that she is a well-behaved member of your family. Some good commands to teach your sheltie include sit, stay, lay down, heel, and shake. Some good things to remember about training your sheltie include:



Use positive reinforcement. Never hit or yell at your sheltie if she disobeys. Instead, give your sheltie treats, praise, and petting when she does a good job. This positive reinforcement will motivate your dog much more than fear-based training methods.Keep training sessions short and regular. Dogs can’t pay attention for too long, so stick to daily 10 minute (or less) sessions.

, A well socialized dog is less likely to develop problems with aggression and anxiety, so take the time to socialize your sheltie while she is a puppy (between eight and 20 weeks old). Take your sheltie out with you and invite people over often so that your sheltie puppy encounters all sorts of things such as:


children and babies
men and women
loud noises
crowds
cars and bikes
other dogs
cats
odd clothing and accessories

Feed your dog.,
Groom your dog.,
Exercise your dog.",How to Choose a Dog Breed Bred for Loyalty2," Feeding is an important way to develop a dog’s loyalty. You can develop your role as a caretaker or caring parent by being the one who provides the food for your dog at specific times during the day. This is better than leaving your dog’s food in a bowl all day because your dog will come to rely on you and to see you as a provider.


You should also encourage other members of your family to feed the dog. The more people that feed your dog, the more people your dog will bond with.

, Make sure that you properly groom and exercise your dog. Combing and brushing your dog’s hair will build your dog's bond with you and your family members. In addition, giving your dog baths will also help you develop a close connection with the animal., Most dogs need a certain amount of exercise to stay healthy. However, some breeds need more exercise than others need and, without enough physical activity, can begin to develop behavioral problems.Make sure that you play with your dog regularly and get them the amount of exercise that they need.

Get your puppy vaccinated.,
Protect your puppy from heartworms.,
Make sure your puppy is spayed or neutered.",How to Care for Bulldogs1," A bulldog puppy can find a new home at eight weeks of age. When you adopt the dog from a breeder or shelter, make sure the dog was taken to the vet for his first check up at six weeks. If the dog hasn’t been taken to the vet, take him to the vet immediately.At six weeks, the vet will determine if the puppy has eye or ear problems, check to make sure the palate is okay, listen to the heart and lungs with a stethoscope to make sure they work properly, and check the belly to make sure there are no hernias.;
, During the first visit to the vet at six weeks, the puppy should have been dewormed. When you adopt him at eight weeks, the puppy will need to be dewormed two to three times more at eight weeks, at 10 weeks, and at 12 weeks., During the dog’s first vet visit at six weeks, the vet should have given him a distemper vaccination. After this initial vaccination, it will be followed by two follow-up vaccinations. Talk to your vet about when your puppy needs the follow up vaccinations.Get your puppy’s rabies vaccination at 12 weeks of age.
Your puppy needs to be vaccinated for Lyme disease at 9 weeks of age followed by a second vaccine at 12 weeks of age. Dogs that spend a lot of time outside or that live in endemic areas for Lyme are at increased risk of contracting this potentially fatal disease.

, Get a heartworm preventative for your puppy, which is a monthly tablet. This can be started at eight weeks of age., The puppy should be either spayed or neutered at six weeks of age. When you adopt your puppy, make sure he is neutered (or spayed, if the puppy is a female). If he is not, take him to the vet to get neutered as soon as possible."
"
Find out what services have been provided to the dog.,
Familiarize yourself with the agency’s placement policy.,
Ask about how to apply for an adoption.,
Find out whether the agency offers continued support.",How to Choose a Dog Adoption Agency2," An agency will likely provide you with a detailed breakdown of their operational costs, as well as the services that have been provided to your dog. For instance, dogs up for adoption are usually fixed and vaccinated.Further, many adoption agencies also provide dogs with preventive treatments to fight infections such as heartworm.
This information is important to have so you know what veterinary services you may need to provide.

, Some organizations, particularly those affiliated with specific breeds, will likely have policies in place regarding their dogs’ placements. For instance, you may be required to have a fenced yard, or a home that is free of cats or children. By asking about these policies, you can save yourself and the adoption agencies time before applying.If a dog has not been spayed or neutered by the time of adoption, the agency can likely connect you with a low cost option with a local organization. They may require you to do so as a term of adoption.

, The application process to adopt a dog varies widely between different organizations. It is within both your own and the agencies' interest to ensure the best possible match between you and your dog, and the application process helps ensure that a suitable match is made. It’s best to know an agency’s specific process to ensure that you are willing to go through with it before you begin.Aside from an initial application about your ability to care for a dog, an agency will likely want to interview you, and may help facilitate the introduction between you, your dog, and potentially even your home environment.

, Sometimes, canine adoption organizations will offer continued support following an adoption. This helps reduce the number of dogs that are returned to them as new owners come to terms with the responsibility of dog ownership. Simply ask a staff member what services they offer following a potential adoption."

Consider fostering.",How to Choose a Border Collie1," Get to know the characteristics of the border collie. Spend some time looking online at dog breed websites, such as the American Kennel Club (AKC). Many of these sites will provide the history of the collie as well as some useful care tips. You can also talk to any friends who own collies and ask them about their ownership experiences.If you need additional guidance you can talk with a dog breed consultant in your local area or online.;
, Border collies are highly intelligent and require a great deal of personal attention. They also need a fair amount of space to run around and play. Look at your daily routine and see if you can envision when you will spend time with your dog and how. Also, think about whether or not you can provide the material conditions (i.e. space) that a collie needs to thrive.Collies enjoying chasing things, including cars, so they can be a real challenge in an urban space. If you live in an area like this you will need to invest in a sturdy fence and a quality leash.

, You may or may not have a preference in this area. Or, you may like the idea of breeding your dog in the future. Females in the breed are generally smaller by a few inches and five pounds or so. There are few real behavioral differences., This is an important decision as it will broaden or limit your search options. Purebred dogs are generally automatically eligible (with paperwork) for AKC competitions and sports. However, they can also fall prey to a variety of genetic disorders and health issues. Crossbred or mixed dogs are generally restricted in AKC activities but can still compete in other areas. They can also combine the best (or worst) characteristics of multiple breeds.For example, a mixed breed Golden Retriever and Border Collie puppy could possess the affective characteristics of the Golden and the athletic prowess of the Collie.

, A puppy will generally require additional socialization and training in order to become a good mature dog. However, you can establish a very close bond from a young age. An adult dog may already have the potty training aspect down and some other tricks as well perhaps. However, they can also have behavioral baggage from their previous owner experiences.As you make your decision remember that a Border Collie puppy period lasts for around three years.

, Border Collies are herding dogs by nature and this means that they can occasionally take this impulse out on small pets and children as well. You will want to carefully consider the comfort of others when choosing a particular Collie. Some dogs do better than others in household situations.No matter which dog you choose you will want to carefully introduce it to any children or other pets. Make a point to monitor all interactions between the Collie and small children in particular. Never leave them alone together., Make sure to budget for the purchase of the dog itself (which can range from free to hundreds of dollars) and the dog’s immediate care as well. This would include veterinary treatment, food, training items, and bedding. Anticipating these costs in advance will make it less of a shock when they pop up.

, Not all dogs are the same. You want to look for a Border Collie that possess a mild temperament, basic manners, and an intellectual curiosity. Your dog should be interested in interacting with you or other strangers. It should be curious about new sounds or smells. It should fall somewhere between the leader of the pack and the wallflower., If you’ve never had a Border Collie before or even owned a dog, fostering is a great way to familiarize yourself with the breed and with dog ownership in general. You will be responsible for the day-to-day care of a Collie until a new home is found. This is a great way to see if a Collie would fit your lifestyle.Fostering also allows you to save a dog’s life in the process. Every dog being fostered is one less potential dog in a kill shelter or on the streets.

When you understand how a beagle's mind works you can then make sure you put everything in place to satisfy your puppy's needs (mental and physical) so they grow up into a well-adjusted, content, and fulfilled adult dog. For example, a beagle's hunting instincts means they are hugely inquisitive and will have their nose into everything whether it's their business or not.;
, Before bringing your puppy home, you should always make sure your house is ""puppy proof."" Pick up any garbage on the floor, personal items, food that is not for puppies or dogs, and other object that your puppy can swallow and/or choke on. Basically, it's essential to puppy proof the house because anything that isn't tidied away out of reach will be explored by the puppy's mouth and teeth.

, If you can't bring the puppy home right away, visit it often so that it will become comfortable around you. Many breeders will allow this, as it is good to get the puppy acclimated to you.


Clearly this depends greatly on where and who you are adopting the puppy from. If you are adopting a puppy from a pound, for example, you should take it home quickly. If, on the other hand, you are adopting the puppy from a wonderful breeder, you should leave the puppy with its mother for as long as the breeder recommends.

, Before bringing home a puppy you will need to get a lot of supplies. Here is a list to get you started:


Food and water bowls: Bowls should preferably be stainless steel or ceramic, as these can be put in a dishwasher and the surface is easy to keep hygienically clean.
A dog bed: The bed should be soft and snuggly, to help puppy feel safe. Choose one with a washable cover and consider getting two beds, so you can have one in the wash and one for puppy.
Puppy pads: These are disposable absorbable pads that are useful for the inevitable toilet training accidents.
Disinfectant and household gloves: These can be used for cleaning up after accidents. Choose an enzymatic cleaner and avoid those containing bleach or ammonia as this can amplify the scent of urine and inadvertently attract puppy back to that spot
A crate: Choose a crate that allows the beagle to stand up and lie with its legs outstretched. If the adult-sized crate is too big, devise a barrier to partition the crate to make it the correct size for the puppy. If a puppy has too much room it may use part of it as a bathroom area.
A collar and tag. Get a nylon collar and metal tag. The metal tag will be a good identifier if the puppy gets loose. Start using a collar at 6 months of age at the least. Remember when sizing the collar that puppies will grow.
Harness and leash: It is great to get your puppy used to these from the start. They also help control the dog in the yard, so it doesn't run off when you are trying to toilet train it.
Toys: Beagle puppies are avid chewers, so make sure all toys are certified as safe. Check toys regularly to see if they are damaged and discard if necessary. Remember stuffing, a toy's eye or nose, or even the squeaker inside could potentially cause a bowel obstruction if swallowed, so don't take that risk.
Puppy treats: Make sure you get some soft and some crunchy treats. The crunchy treats will help clean tartar off your puppy's teeth, and the soft ones are good for using while training.
Puppy food: Make sure you get the food it has already been eating if at all possible.
Basic grooming tools: Get a bristle brush, comb, rubber gloves, nail clippers, dog shampoo, dog conditioner, dog toothpaste, toothbrush, and towels.

, This is the place where you want it go to the bathroom. Pop the pup on the toilet spot and if it happens to squat down. If it does, give it lots of praise and a treat so that the puppy begins to associate that spot with the right place to go to the toilet.Walk your puppy around its new yard, and neighborhood before going inside. This will get it associated with the area and define its new territory., Don't go crazy and shower it will love just yet. You need to give it time to adjust to its new home. Have any kids sit quietly and let the puppy go to them, so that it doesn't feel overwhelmed. Remember to keep a close eye on the puppy and at the first sign of it sniffing to toilet pop it outside on the toilet spot, and reward it for going., Once you bring your puppy home, show it around the house. This way the puppy will feel more comfortable knowing where everything is. This doesn't mean that you should let the puppy in every room right away, so just show it the rooms it will be allowed in., This is so it can eat something familiar that its tummy is used to digesting. Make a gradual change over to the food you select, once the puppy has had one or two days to get used to its new home.To make this change add in a little of the new food (say ¼) and cut down on its previous diet (to ¾). Over 2 - 3 days further increase the amount of new food as you wean the puppy off the original diet. This gives the bugs in its tummy a chance to change over so that it doesn't get diarrhea because of a sudden change of food.

, Examine the label on the food packaging and check that a named meat, such as chicken, beef, or lamb, heads the list. This means the main ingredient is that named meat and is an indication of quality. Avoid foods which list cereals as the main ingredient and also ""meat-by-products,"" since these are the less nutritional parts.


Once puppy is a year old switch it onto adult food.

, For a puppy under 12 weeks of age feed the recommended quantity of food (as per the pack instructions) divided into 4 meals spaced over the day. For a puppy aged 3 - 6 months divide his daily allowance into 3 meals. For six months or over feed 2 meals a day.


Once the puppy is one year old you have the option of feeding it just once a day.

, Remember that beagles are exceptionally greedy. The beagle has no concept of when it is full, so don't give into that appealing expression and give it extra food. Also, make sure all food is kept out of reach and in a sealed container, because your puppy will relish the challenge of finding a way to break into a food bin.However, the good news is that beagles are highly motivated by food which gives you an excellent training tool.

, Be aware that after puppy has eaten, approximately 10 - 20 minutes later, it will get the urge to toilet. Put the puppy outside after a meal and remember to stay with it so that you are there to praise it when it goes.

, Or, just throw them in the dishwasher. Washing food bowls prevents illness, bacteria from growing, and it makes each mealtime more enjoyable.

, Beagles are energetic dogs that need plenty of exercise but be gentle with your growing dog's joints. The growing joint is more vulnerable to injury. To avoid this, much like an athlete warms up before a race, walk your puppy for 5 minutes before playing games of chase or fetch with it., A good rule of thumb is never to exercise your puppy past the point where it drags itself along. If its muscles are tired, the puppy will stop supporting the joints. This is when it is most likely to injure its joints. If the puppy still has a spring in its step then you are OK.


Be wary of over exercise until the puppy has reached its adult size, at 12 - 18 months of age.

, Any more will make it too tired and hurt its joints. Exercise the puppy additionally by playing fetch or tugging on toys.


Spend as much time as you can with your puppy. It won't be little for long, so take advantage of this time by playing and exercising with the puppy on a regular basis.

, Your beagle puppy will not exercise itself as well as if you get involved with it. Also, beagles love to wander and explore by themselves. This means that an unattended beagle in the yard may worm its way through or under a fence and go exploring. They are first class diggers and climbers so never assume your fence is secure. If your puppy truly can't escape be aware that frustration may cause the pup to bay or howl. Your best bet to prevent this is plenty of exercise and mental stimulation so that it is contentedly tired and doesn't feel bored or frustrated.

, The beagle's stubborn temperament makes it important to start training early so that it learns to listen to you. Incorporate training into everyday activities, such as getting the puppy to sit before putting its food down or putting its leash on. Keep actual training sessions short when puppy is very young, just 5 - 10 minutes when it is less than four months old.

, Don't punish your puppy. It will only associate the punishment with you (and become wary of you) rather than what it did wrong. Instead, give rewards when the puppy does something right. Be sure to give your puppy lots of love, attention and gentle guidance about good behavior.

, This will make your dog more enjoyable to be around in the long term. Begin by teaching your dog to sit. Then begin training the puppy to come when called and to stay on command. You will also want to start potty training the puppy the day you get it.

, Otherwise, every time you get in the car it might think it is going to the vet. Then, the puppy will start whining and you will get frustrated.

, Bring it to a puppy obedience class once a week. This will help the dog learn how to act around unfamiliar dogs and people.


However, don't expose your puppy to other dogs before it receives its vaccinations.

, The puppy with have a natural instinct to feel safe in a den and the crate becomes its go-to place to take time out and feel safe. Start by putting a blanket in the crate that smells of the puppy's mother, and also hide treats in the crate so that the puppy willingly goes and associates it with good things.


Also, feed the puppy in the crate. At first feed with the door open. Once it goes in of its own accord, shut the door for a few seconds, open the door, and then praise the pup afterwards for being so good. Gradually build up the amount of time the door stays shut until you can leave the puppy for up to four hours at a time and it won't get distressed.Leave a radio on for your puppy when not at home. This will make him feel safer.

, Schedule vet appointments for the proper vaccinations starting at 6-8 weeks of age. Your veterinarian will advise you about specific disease risks in your area and which diseases to vaccinate puppy against.


Also discuss desexing with your vet so you can decide on what's best for your dog.

, It's important to take your puppy to the vet regularly so that any problems can be spotted early. Caring for your puppy also means giving regular preventative healthcare treatments, such as heartworm, flea, and tick medications.

, Bring treats with you so you can give them to the puppy while you are there. If you take your puppy to the vet from an early age, it will get more used to the situation.

, This is a quick injection that inserts a small microchip into the skin. Each chip has a unique ID number which is registered against your details and is proof of ownership. This is especially appropriate for a beagle because if he escapes and goes walkabout, when he is handed into a dog pound they can scan the chip, find out who he belongs to and reunite you.

, Use a bristle brush to remove shed hair and make its coat shine. Also include a dog-toothbrush and toothpaste in your grooming tools so that you can get the pup used to having its teeth brushed right away.

, Be careful to keep water temperature not too warm, and do not bathe your puppy too frequently. Frequent bathing will dry out its skin.


Use a mild shampoo, such as a moisturizing oatmeal shampoo. Never use products designed for human use, as the pH of dog skin differs and the human shampoo will have an excessively drying effect.

, Clean its eyes daily to prevent infections and tear stains. Even breeds without white coats can get tear stains and inflammation of the skin around the eye. Clean ears bi-weekly to prevent wax and stink.

Know that bulldogs have Brachycephalic syndrome.,
Keep your bulldog cool.,
Monitor your dog’s exercise.,
Be aware of other conditions.,
Keep an attentive eye on your bulldog.,
Join the Bulldog Club of America.",How to Care for Bulldogs2," As a consequence of their facial structure with the pushed in face, bulldogs are considered Brachycephalic. This leads to snoring, snorting, and breathing difficulties along with low tolerance for exercise., Because of the Bracycephalic syndrome, your bulldog has trouble cooling himself through panting if he gets too hot. Bulldogs should be kept indoors if it is above 85 degrees Fahrenheit outside. Because of this, you need to monitor your dog in hot and humid weather. Too much panting can cause swollen and inflamed airways and make it hard for your dog to breathe, and even cause heat stroke.A bulldog is too hot when he is panting too much, heaving, making odd sounds in his throat, foaming from the mouth, fighting for breath, and displaying a floppy, loose, discolored tongue.Never leave your dog unattended in hot weather. Always watch for the signs of overheating. Never leave your bulldog (or any dog) alone in a car during hot or warm weather. This could result in death.Make sure your bulldog has somewhere cool, out of sunlight, and in air conditioning to sleep during the summer.If your bulldog is overheating, remove him immediately from heat. Place him in cool water, pour cool water over his head, and pour cool water on his paws, especially on the pads of his paws. If you can't get him into a tub or a pool, spray him with cool water using gentle pressure.Tile flooring is a good place to place your bulldog to help cool him off. You can also place your bulldog by a fan to help cool him off. Use your hands to spread the fur around to let out some of the heat from his body.
Let your bulldog tell you if he is too hot. He should be able to know when he's too hot. Pay attention to the signs he gives you during hot weather. If he wants to go in from a walk, take him inside.
If you dog starts to overheat, he may start coughing up phlegm. This is normal; however, it is a sign that your dog is too hot and needs to be cooled down immediately. Remove the bulldog from heat, put lemon juice in his mouth to get rid of the phlegm, place a wet towel on him, and make sure he drinks water., Too much vigorous exercise can cause breathing problems for your bulldog. However, obesity can also cause breathing problems, so your bulldog still needs to exercise. Just make sure to keep an eye on your dog to make sure he isn’t panting too much or overheating while exercising.When your dog starts to pant during exercise, stop and allow him to rest. Don’t make your dog do too much exercise during hot weather.

, Because of your dog’s face shape, there are other conditions that can arise. Your bulldog may have abnormal teeth patterns because of his face shape. He can also be prone to skin infections or abnormal eyelashes that can irritate the eye.Your dog can also be prone to hip and knee problems.

, Bulldogs are stubborn and mild dogs. This means your bulldog may not let you know if he is injured, feeling bad, hungry, or cold. Keep an eye on your dog to monitor him. If you notice any changes, find out why., By joining either the local or national bulldog club, you can connect with other bulldog owners and breeders. This can help you if you ever have questions or need help with your bulldog. This club can also help you find a vet who has experience treating bulldogs, which is important since bulldogs have specific health needs."

Learn the typical characteristics of Bedlington Terrier.,
Choose a Bedlington if you suffer from pet allergies.,
Be aware that your Bedlington will need frequent grooming.,
Consider if you have enough time to devote to this breed.,
Find a reliable breeder.,
Inspect the breeder's home.,
Inspect the dog.,
Find a rescue agency.,
Be cautious about eye issues.,
Watch for liver problems.,
Check your Bedlington Terrier’s weight.",How to Choose a Bedlington Terrier," Bedlington Terriers are lively, playful, and inquisitive. They are loyal, but can be headstrong when stimulated. They are typically easy to train and very adaptable.These dogs usually enjoy peacefully relaxing with people and are good pets for all ages. If you have children, this is a good choice of dog for you.;
, Generally white, Bedlingtons have a non-shedding coat which can make them better pets for allergy sufferers. Since they shed very little, they also make less of a mess in the house.They are especially good for people with allergies if you get them groomed regularly. This will cut down on the pet dander in your house even more.

, Their thick and linty coats need brushing or combing twice a week at least, so ensure you have time to do this if you are going to choose a Bedlington Terrier. Your dog's coat will need a trim every 6-8 weeks too.You don't have to go to the groomer if you don’t want to; you can learn how to trim your dog yourself.

, Bedlingtons need around one hour of exercise per day and they live, on average, between 11 and 16 years. Being Terriers, Bedlingtons do like to dig – so they need some supervision while playing outside.They are also speedy little dogs and have been compared to Whippets when running. This means that you’ll need to take your Bedlington Terrier to the dog park regularly if you don’t have a fenced-in yard for it to run around in.

, It is important that you find a legitimate and ethical breeder to purchase your puppy from. This will help you avoid the health problems of puppy mill puppies. If you want, you can contact a breed club, such as the Bedlington Terrier Club of America, to locate an approved or recommended breeder.

You may want to find a breeder that registers their dogs with a kennel club, such as the American Kennel Club or the United Kennel Club. These organizations have strict requirements about the health and genetics of the parents and puppies that are registered.
If you know someone with a Bedlington Terrier, you can ask them where they got their dog. They may be able to recommend you to a good breeder.

, If possible, try to see the mother and father of the puppy. All puppies are adorable; we are ""hard wired"" to be attracted to infant mammals, so don't fall for the first one you see. When in doubt, wait, because there will always be another adorable one to consider.Look around – is the area clean, are the animals healthy, does it smell hygienic? Do the puppies look like they want to play or are they cowering in the corner?
Are the puppies clean? Any sign of diarrhea (wet or dirty hair around their bottom), are their eyes clear (no redness or matter on the lids), is the nose clean or crusted with mucus?
Is there a place set aside for you to take the puppy to watch him walk or play with toys?
What is their policy about a health guarantee? Have the puppies been checked out by a local veterinarian? A good breeder will require that you take the puppy to your vet within 24 hours (or the next business day) to make sure the pet is healthy at purchase.
Ask the breeder what they can tell you about the dog you are interested in. Also ask about the parents. Will the breeder let you see the health records of the parents? If they can't tell you anything, be careful.
Avoid buying from a pet store. Pet stores get their puppies from ""puppy mills"", where the parents are not treated well, so be alert for any signs the staff are just there to sell animals but don't really care about them.

, Ask the staff to take the puppy from the cage so you can look at him. Try to set him on the floor so you can see him move. He should seem alert and interested in what is going on around him. He should want to chase after a toy if it is placed in front of him.Pick him up and turn him on his back in your arms. Is he cooperative or does he fight to not be turned over? A dog with a trainable personality should resist for a moment but eventually lay on his back in your arms without struggling.

Rub his tummy and see if he likes it; he should. A dog that cowers in the corner and is afraid to be picked up can be difficult to handle as it grows up; he may bite when he is inappropriately fearful and avoid being with people.
While you have the puppy in your arms, gently feel his tummy and bones. A bulge at the bellybutton can be a hernia that could need surgical repair. Puppy bones are soft, but you can feel for any unusual angles or bulges on his legs where there may have been injuries. Even if you are taking him to your vet the next day, it is hard to return a sick animal that you have already started to care about.

, If you don’t want to purchase a puppy, try to find a well-known Bedlington Terrier rescue group. You can find tons of healthy, pure-bred, and trained dogs there at a fraction of the cost (you usually only have to pay an adoption fee).Search on the internet for well-respected rescue/adoption groups for Bedlington Terriers.
This also allows you to rescue the dog and give it a loving home.

, Bedlington Terriers are prone to certain eye disorders. While this is not a hugely common issue among Bedlington Terriers, it is more common among Bedlingtons than other breeds. You will need to watch their eyes carefully and notify your vet if you notice anything unusual about their vision or their actual eyes. The most common eye diseases that affect this breed are retinal dysplasia, cataracts, and eyelash/tear duct abnormalities.
You should inspect your Bedlington Terrier’s eyes before choosing to purchase or adopt the dog, just to be on the safe side. Look into their eyes. A healthy dog will have clear eyes with no discharge or crusts around the eyes. To determine if they can see well, hold a toy in your hands and move it in front of the dog. The dog should be able to follow it with their eyes.

, One problem you may encounter is the condition Copper Toxicosis, a disorder of copper accumulation that can result in severe liver disease. Unfortunately, it is hereditary and the condition cannot be ignored. The dog's prognosis depends on the severity of the symptoms as well as how quickly they developed. Older dogs will often have a chronic type of disease that develops progressively over time. With treatment, they generally have a better prognosis than sudden, acute, and/or severe onset, which typically appears in younger dogs.Some common signs of liver disease in Bedlington Terriers include lethargy, depression, anorexia, vomiting, yellowish discoloration of the skin, or excessive thirst.
Bedlington Terriers can be tested for the genetic mutation that causes this condition. You may want to have your vet test the dog to see if they carry the genetic mutation for this disease.

, Healthy Bedlington Terriers typically weigh between 17 lb (7.7 kg) and 23 lb (10 kg). A generally healthy dog with a good appetite, the Bedlington can be fed twice a day on dry or tinned food. A healthy animal has no special dietary requirements.A lower (or higher) weight can be a symptom of a health problem.
Providing a healthy, balanced diet for your dog will help prevent health issues in the future.

Know, before hand, that you have the resources, and time to take care of a lab puppy.,
Choose the lead, collar, bowl, food type, and sleeping places.,
Make a comfy, warm bed for it to sleep in.,
Make sure to exercise your puppy.,
Keep your dog busy.,
Spend time with your puppy.,
Feed your puppy right.,
Brush your puppy at least once a week.,
Take your puppy to the vet once a year.,
Do some research on best puppy practices.",How to Take Care of a Labrador Puppy," If you don’t, both you and your puppy could suffer.;
, This will be where the puppy will go for the rest of his/her life, so choose wisely. Remember, that food and water needs to be kept under shelter.

, Again make sure that it is under shelter. The dog will get used to it, so make sure that it is permanent.

, Labradors require extensive exercise and daily playtime, so they don’t become over weight, and they will stay happy.

, It is in their bones to be busy, so don’t keep them locked up inside all day.

, Labs are happiest when they are with people, so make sure you can spend time with your puppy.


Your puppy needs daily interactions with people, as well as other animals. If you don’t do this, your puppy will become insecure, and will not like being around other people. This can result in your dog biting guests.

, Puppies can eat adult food, but with a protein content of 25% or less.


You have to feed your puppy three times a day.

However, you can’t leave the food out all day. Take the food away after about 10 or 15 minuets.

Food products with sources of Chondroitin Sulfate and Glucosamine are good for lab puppy joints.





, They need this extra grooming session so their hair doesn’t become knotted.

, You want to make sure your puppy is healthy, and strong. You can do this by taking them to a vet to get a thorough check-up.


A healthy puppy will have clear, shiny eyes that are free from discharge. The puppies coat will be glossy, with a little flaking skin. Your puppy should also be alert and playful.

, Training a dog is hard work, and requires consistency. Know what you want them to learn and how you want them to respond to your commands before you dive in, so that you don't have to switch your approach later on (and confuse them!).

Default to animal shelters and rescues.,
Consider a breed-specific rescue organization.,
Look for a dog whose behavior will match your lifestyle.,
Expect imperfect breed analysis at many adoption facilities.",How to Choose a Dog Adoption Agency3," Aside from the lower costs of adopting through a non-profit shelter or rescue facility, it’s worth noting some other facts about these types of organizations. They house 6 to 8 million animals annually, only half of which will be adopted. Many of these dogs were not placed in these facilities at any fault of their own, and many are ready and capable to join your home safely and happily., Some adoption agencies work with one type of dog breed in particular. If you're hoping to adopt a dog of a certain breed, look online for agencies that specialize accordingly.Meanwhile, it's important to note that roughly 25% of the dogs cared for by all dog shelters are purebred. In fact, many breed-specific organizations operate by matching interested people with purebred dogs being held in regular animal shelters.

, Rescue dogs are often not only immunized and fixed, many are also house trained. Many shelters also work to ensure that dogs are socialized with one another, as well as with people. Whatever each dog’s personality, the facility or foster home that’s caring for them will provide you with their behavior analysis.Ask about how an organization trains their dogs and what information they have on a particular dog’s behavior. This will help you choose not only a caring adoption agency, but just the right dog.
In fact, adoption staff may help you identify aspects of your lifestyle that will help you choose a dog.

, Most importantly, many of the dogs at adoption facilities are well-behaved and capable of being further trained. However, you should not assume that an adoption facility has correctly assessed a dog’s breed. Staff, including veterinarians, often simply guess dogs’ breed based on appearance alone.Some dogs with certain types of breed heritage are more or less likely to have been correctly identified. In fact, DNA analysis almost always reveals a different genetic heritage than the breed that was assessed visually.

Adopt from a rescue organization.,
Adopt from a shelter.,
Avoid purchasing from a pet store.",How to Choose a Border Collie2," To find a breed-specific rescue group in your area go online and search your city’s name and “Border Collie rescue.” You will likely discover that there is a group close to you that specializes in helping and rehoming Collies. The Border Collie Society of America can also direct you to local rescue organizations.The dogs at rescue organizations generally do not have anything ‘wrong’ with them. They are there often as a result of mismatched expectations on the part of the owner. If you are educated about owning a Collie, you can often find an excellent dog via a rescue group.
You can expect a rescue group to have a variety of adoption requirements. They may want you to complete formal application, participate in a phone interview, agree to a vet and reference check, allow a home visit, and pay an adoption fee. Rescues will also usually ask that you return the dog if the adoption does not work out at any time. If you are interested in competing in AKC competitions with your adopted dog, there are options available to you. It is possible to apply for a Purebred Alternative Listing (PAL) registration through the AKC website.

, Visit your local animal shelter to see if there is a Border Collie available. If not, you can always ask that they call you if one comes in. While you are there, check out the other dogs up for adoption. You just might find one that calls out to you. Be prepared to pay an adoption fee. You will also likely need to agree to spay or neuter your dog if it hasn’t been done already.


Many shelters and rescue organizations now list their available pets online via sites like Adopt-a-Pet. These sites are great ways to expand your choices.

, Do not buy your dog from a pet shop as this will, most likely, support puppy mills. Responsible breeders will not sell to store locations and so, odds are, the puppies came from a poor breeding facility. They may have suffered from abuse and could continue to have health problems in the future."

Locate a reputable breeder.,
Interview potential breeders.,
Plan to visit the breeder.,
Meet the puppy’s parents.,
Select your final puppy carefully.,
Attain health clearances.,
Read your final contract carefully.",How to Choose a Border Collie3," To find a breeder with a solid reputation contact your local Border Collie association or the AKC. The AKC, in particular, will put you in touch with a specialist who will help you reach out to breeders. You can also ask your vet for recommendations or attend a local dog show.Of course, if you know someone who owns a great Collie one of the best options is just to ask them where they got their dog. This is a great way to get a personal reference and inside information about a breeder.
If you are purchasing a Collie as a work dog it is a good idea to attend an agricultural meeting or trial in your area. You can find information on these gathering through the United States Border Collie Handlers Association website.Be aware that if you are purchasing from a breeder you will not likely get to choose an adult dog. Most breeders only sell puppies and these are only released after they reach a minimum of eight weeks of age.

, Plan to ask breeders a number of questions regarding their level of personal experience and the way that they take care of the dogs. A good breeder should be able to tell you almost anything about the pros and cons of Collies. They should also give you specific information regarding the litter in question. You can also ask about their caretaking philosophy.You might ask, “How many litters do you raise per year?” A good breeder will tell you 1-2 litters per year. You could inquire about their professional certifications. Many breeders will belong to local canine organizations or branches of the AKC.
Your breeder should also provide you with a list of personal and professional references. These should include a vet who can verify any pertinent medical records. Satisfied customers are also good references. And, it is even better if your breeder has other breeders who are willing to provide references.

, It is best if you can visit the breeding facility at least once, if not more, before finalizing the purchase of your puppy. It is also important to bring your family members, including children, with you if you can. When you are at the facility take a tour of the grounds paying attention to cleanliness and the animal’s housing.A good kennel facility should be orderly and spacious, allowing the dog’s plenty of room for exercise. The food and water bowls should be clean. A particular bathroom area should be established with evidence that the feces are picked up and disposed of regularly. The facility should smell clean.
Observe how the dogs react to the breeder as well. This will give you an idea regarding how well they are socialized. The dogs should be happy to greet the breeder and should display no aggressive behaviors. Watch to see if any dogs hang back or act frightened as this can be the sign of a poor breeding environment.

, Make sure to meet at least the mother dog (dam) when you visit the facility. Observe her behavior to see if she is a pleasant companion animal. This, after all, is an adult version of what your puppy will become. Look to see if she is well taken care of and if she is in good health.

, You should always try to get a choice between a number of puppies. When you visit try to interact with your puppy options to see how they are socialized and how they behave amongst their littermates. You want to select a puppy that is neither dominant nor shy. Go for the middle-of-the-road in terms of personality for the safest bet., The breeder should provide health documents from an independent agency showing that your puppy’s relatives have been tested and shown to be clear of genetic abnormalities. For Border Collies, in particular, you want to see a clearance from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA). This will lessen the possibility of purchasing a collie with a potential for hip dysplasia., After all the details are ironed out the breeder will provide you with a written contract. Spend some time looking over this document and ask any questions that you have. The contract will likely include the purchase price and pick-up details as well as return information if the puppy just doesn’t work out.

Feed your dog a balanced diet.,
Avoid giving your bulldog soy.,
Give your dog fresh water.,
Consider a stainless steel bowl.",How to Care for Bulldogs3," Your bulldog will need a high-quality food that is balanced in the nutrients dogs need. Read the ingredient list on the pet food label. If the first two or three ingredients are meat and not meat by-products, it’s probably a high quality food. The dog food label will also give the recommended amount of food to feed your bulldog daily. Use an actual measuring cup to measure this food out to make sure he eats properly for his size, age, and activity level.You can also ask your bulldog’s breeder or your veterinarian for their suggestions.

, When choosing food for your bulldog, do not get food that contains soy. Soy ferments and produces a lot of gas in the bowels, which can predispose the dog to bloat, so its best avoided., Always remember to leave clean, fresh water out for your bulldog at all times. Clean the water bowl about once a week or even more frequently. Running it through the dishwasher is a good way to sterilize the bowl.

, Buy a heavy duty stainless steel bowl. This can help reduce redness and rashes from developing on your bulldog’s face."
"
Brush your dog.,
Clean the wrinkles.,
Trim your dog’s nails.,
Brush your dog’s teeth.,
Socialize your dog.",How to Care for Bulldogs4," Your bulldog will need a good brushing with a soft bristled brush once a week. This brushing will remove loose hair and skin flakes, and also encourage good skin circulation.


This will also give you time to bond with your dog.

, One problem most bulldogs have is dirt and yeast collecting in their skin folds. The wrinkles should be taken care of and wiped out as needed to prevent skin irritation and possible infections. If you fail to clean your bulldog’s wrinkles, he can end up with foul-smelling yeast or infections.Make sure to clean the wrinkles on the face, body, and tail.


Use a soft cotton ball soaked in an ear or eye cleaning solution to gently wipe out the fold. Follow this by a gently drying with a clean, soft towel. Don’t use peroxide or alcohol because they can irritate the skin.
Follow up by placing cornstarch on the wrinkles to help dry excess moisture.
Scabs, redness, or itchy skin should also be addressed by a veterinarian if they persist after being watched for a few days.

, As part of the grooming routine you will need to trim your bulldog’s nails. The biggest problems is to avoid nicking the quick, the part of the nail where the blood vessels and nerves grow. If you aren’t sure how to clip the nails, ask your veterinarian technician to show you how to do so on your dog., Brush your bulldog’s teeth regularly. It takes less than a minute to do this and removes bacteria and plaque from the surface of the teeth. Brushing also lets you check for mouth problems like sores, growths, or loose or damaged teeth.Only use dog toothpaste on a dog. You can purchase a dog toothbrush and toothpaste at pet stores or veterinary clinics.
Get your dog used to brushing by letting her lick the dog toothpaste off your finger. Next put a little paste on the brush and wipe it along the gums. Each day try to brush a little bit of the teeth until you work up to being able to brush all the outer surfaces of the teeth. You don’t need to try to brush the inner teeth as most plaque attacks the outer teeth.
You can also supplement brushing with dental formulated foods and teeth which help to remove the bacteria and plaque.

, It is vitally important to properly socialize your bulldog when he is a puppy. This gets him used to other people, dogs, pets, and novel situations in a healthy manner. From day one, introduce your bulldog puppy to people, other animals and dogs, and situations outside your home. Take him for car rides, walks around the neighborhood, and to parks to let him meet new people and other dogs.Large pet stores, humane societies, and community groups frequently hold puppy socialization classes. These are a great way for young pups to meet other puppies in a safe and controlled manner. As the puppy gets older, a basic obedience class is a good supplement, plus it teaches your bulldog good manners.
You can also take your dog to the dog park.

Look for increased crying and whining.,
Notice a decrease in appetite.,
Note any weight loss.,
Spot a change in sleep patterns.,
Notice if the puppy sleeps away from the rest of the group.,
Pay attention to the mother’s behavior.",How to Spot Health Problems in Newborn Puppies1," Healthy newborn puppies should cry very little. In fact, they should spend most of their time either sleeping or eating. If you notice your puppy crying or whining frequently, be sure to take it to your veterinarian.Increased crying is a common symptom of most neonatal problems. If a puppy is crying, it may be overheated, becoming ill, experiencing pain, or not getting enough to eat.;
, Puppies nurse frequently throughout the day. If you notice that any of the puppies are not nursing regularly, this may be a symptom of a larger problem. The puppies may be ill, have a digestive disorder, or be unable to nurse properly. Be sure to visit your veterinarian if you observe a decrease in appetite by any of your puppies.This may be a symptom of hypothermia as well. Pups younger than six days old are unable to shiver and regulate their body temperature properly. A pup suffering from hypothermia will be unable to nurse or digest its food.

, Depending on the breed, a healthy newborn puppy can weigh between 4.2 and 22 ounces (120 to 625 g). In its first few weeks, a healthy puppy should gain 5 to 10 percent of its birth weight each day. Weigh your puppies twice a day and take them to the veterinarian if they are not gaining weight normally or are losing weight. A failure to gain weight or a loss in weight can be a symptom of poor nutrition, an infection, or a congenital disorder like hypoglycemia.Be sure to talk with your veterinarian about what healthy weight gain should look like for pups.
A loss in weight may also be the result of nipple guarding by larger puppies in the liter.

, When they are not nursing, newborn puppies should spend most of their time sleeping. If you notice that any of your puppies are not sleeping regularly or seem restless, be sure to take them to the vet. They may be suffering from an infection of some sort or not getting their nutritional needs met.Be sure to check your newborn pups every few hours to make sure that they are sleeping and eating normally.

, A healthy puppy will sleep in a group with its siblings and close to its mother. This helps the pups regulate their body temperatures and facilitates feeding. However, if a pup is sleeping away from the rest of the group, it is likely that the mother has pushed it away for some reason. They puppy may have a congenital issue or the mother may not have enough milk to feed all of the pups and has decided to sacrifice this puppy to save the litter.If a puppy has become separated from the litter, have your veterinarian examine the pup. It may have a congenital disorder that will limit its quality of life. In that case, your veterinarian may suggest euthanizing the pup.
If the mother is unable to feed all of the pups, you may be able to successfully feed the pup yourself.

, Often, the declining health of puppies is a result of the mother’s actions. Maternal neglect is a common cause of health problems in newborn puppies. A mother may not lie with her pups and warm them. She may also refuse to nurse her pups or not have enough milk to feed them all. Large breed dogs sometimes clumsily step on their pups or smother them with their large bodies.If you notice that the mother is not capable of or is disinterested in caring for her pups, you should remove them and care for them yourself.

Consider how mother dogs and other puppies teach puppies not to bite.,
Let out a loud “yip” if your puppy bites you.,
Praise your puppy for good behavior.",How to Stop Puppy Biting1," If a puppy bites another puppy or its mother too hard, then the bitten pup will give a loud “yip.” This startles the biting puppy and causes him to stop biting. If he continues to bite, then the bitten pup will yelp and run away. Since the puppy doing the biting wants to play he’ll learn to stop biting or else play stops. You can use a similar procedure to teach your puppy not to bite you., If during play, your puppy starts to mouth you and bites or nips, then give a loud, high-pitched “yip.” This should startle your puppy and cause him to stop biting you.Let your hand go limp at the same time that you “yip” and stop playing. If he keeps biting, then walk away from your puppy and only restore attention when he is behaving properly.If he does not stop, then try saying “Too bad!” in a stern voice and walk away from your puppy. Go into another room and ignore your puppy for 10-20 seconds. Doing this will act as a time out and help to teach your puppy that biting too hard makes the play stop., When your puppy does back off, make sure that you give him lots of praise and start playing again. Keep repeating this process every time your puppy nips or bites and he should become gentler and gentler."

Limit handling during the neonatal period.,
Keep the pups isolated in a warm dog bed.,
Bottle feed the puppies.,
Help the pups urinate and defecate.,
Briefly handle pups during the transition period.,
Groom the puppies.,
Transition the pups to eating solid food.,
Let the pups play and roughhouse.,
Let the puppies experience the outside world.,
Expose the puppies to other people.,
Socialize the pups with other puppies and dogs.,
Take the pups to the veterinarian.",How to Socialize Orphaned Newborn Puppies," The neonatal period extends from birth through two weeks. During this period, the pups’ eyes and ears will not be open, and they’ll be limited to the sense of taste, smell, and touch. The mother dog (dam) would normally watch them closely at this time, so the responsibility is now yours.Touch the pups when necessary—primarily to feed them—and allow your scent to imprint on the pups. This will help them develop an emotional bond with you, as the surrogate dam.;
, In a natural setting, the pups' mother would confine them to a den or bed, where the pups would stay during the neonatal stage. Keep the temperature in the room warm, and you can leave the lights off, since the puppies won’t be able to see. Since the pups’ mother would normally provide body heat, you’ll need to place a blanket over the pups or set a heating pad (set to “low”) beneath their bed.Since the pups will be largely immobile during the neonatal stage, they are too young to be handled by children. Also restrict the number of adults that handle the pups; were the puppies not orphans, only the dam would interact with neonatal pups.

, Since the dam would normally breastfeed her pups, you’ll need to manually feed the orphaned puppies. Feed each puppy while it is lying on its back, and let it suck on the bottle nipple until full. During the first 72 hours of the puppies’ lives, feed each pup once every two hours. For the duration of the neonatal period, feed the pups every four hours during the day, although you can leave the pups unfed for 6 hours at night.Puppy feeding bottles should be available for purchase at your local pet store. Also purchase a puppy-specific brand of formula, as puppy formula will provide the nutrients that the pups need. Do not feed your puppies cows’ milk or goats’ milk.
Ask your veterinarian if they have a preferred type of bottle and a preferred brand of puppy formula.

, During the neonatal period, puppies are unable to eliminate waste on their own, as they lack control over the corresponding muscles. Were the pups not orphans, their mother would stimulate urination and defecation by licking the puppies’ anal area. Since the pups are orphans, you’ll need to provide this stimulation. Use a warm, damp washcloth to wipe the pups’ anal and genital areas, and clean up any excrement that the pups produce.You’ll need to facilitate the puppies’ waste elimination until they’re roughly three weeks old. After that point, the pups will gain the necessary muscle control to urinate and defecate on their own.

, This period covers from two to four weeks; the pups eyes and ears will open, and they’ll begin to walk and take a few tentative steps around the bed where they’ve been kept. It’s important that the pups are handled during this period, so that you can imprint on them and the pups gain familiarity with humans. Stroke and hold each pup for only a couple of minutes every day.The pups will begin walking during the transition period, and will be quite clumsy. Keep a close eye on the pups, and don’t let them out of the room with their bed.

, Grooming is another behavior that the dam would usually perform for her puppies; since the puppies are orphans, you’ll need to groom the pups. In addition to providing basic hygiene, grooming also plays a role in the pups’ socialization by providing physical warmth and contact. You should at least hold and brush the pups once every couple of days; this will help the pups’ brains develop more quickly and will form an emotional bond between you and the puppies.Depending on the breed of dog, the pups may require more or less grooming. If you’re unfamiliar with the breed’s grooming requirements, ask your veterinarian how you should groom the puppies.

, While the puppies will need to be bottle fed during the first 5 weeks of their lives—the time during which they would normally be breastfed by their dam—by the 6th week, the pups’ teeth will have developed enough for them to begin eating kibble. If you have the time, you can help the pups transition by providing “puppy mush” between 4-6 weeks as an intermediate food. You can make puppy mush by placing kibble, puppy milk formula, and warm water in a blender.In case some of the pups’ teeth are slow to push through the gums, you should also make soft, canned food available, in case some of the pups prefer this food.

, Although the puppies will be small and weak when newborn, they will quickly become curious, playful, and active. Between 4 and 12 weeks, the pups will begin to socialize with one another, often through playful “wrestling.” The puppies will also begin to explore their environment and engage with the humans they encounter.Once the pups reach about five weeks of age, you can let them out of the room in which they were kept following birth. Let the pups roam through your house or apartment—but keep a close watch on them, especially around stairs.

, Between three and twelve weeks, pups go through a period of critical socialization, during which they need to be exposed to new experiences, sounds, and people. If pups are inadequately socialized, they may be hostile towards unfamiliar people and animals, or may react with fear to all new situations.Take the puppies on brief walks around the neighborhood you live in. This will allow them to hear traffic and outdoor sounds, and let the pups overcome their initial fears of the unfamiliar outside world.

, Show the puppies to your friends and family members, and invite them to gently play with the pups. The puppies need to learn to inhibit their urge to playfully bite, and should develop social skills with people. Take the pups to a dog park or regular park, and ask a couple of friends to meet you there to play with and cuddle the pups.The pups should be exposed to a range of ages (from children to the elderly), and need to meet people in a variety of settings. If possible, take the puppies to work or school with you, and allow anyone interested to pet the pup.
Make sure that all of these interactions are positive and fun for the puppy. If the pup shows signs of fatigue or anxiety (for example, hiding in a corner), remove the pup from the situation., This is an important aspect of socialization: even though the orphaned pups have each other to play and socialize with, exposing them to other puppies, grown dogs, and other animal species, will help your puppies develop social skills.Also consider taking your puppies to a “puppy class”: a large group of puppies gathered by their owners to socialize. These classes are often facilitated through pet stores, such as PetSmart or Petco. If you have friends or family members who own puppies or dogs, invite them to bring the pups to your house or apartment. Be sensitive to differences in age and size, however; your tiny pups could be accidentally harmed by an energetic large dog.
Before allowing your puppies to meet other animals, make sure that your pups have all been vaccinated, and that the other animals have been as well.

, Your orphaned pups won’t need to have their first visit to the vet until they’re about six weeks old. At this point, the pups will be old enough to transport safely, and will have developed physically enough to allow the veterinarian to assess their overall health. Make sure the vet knows that the pups are orphans, and ask if the puppies are ready to begin receiving standard vaccinations.If you are concerned about the pups’ health prior to six weeks—especially if they display concerning symptoms like vomiting, crying, coughing, or diarrhea—call the vet and schedule an appointment or a house call immediately.

Feed your puppy gourmet food for main meals, and whole organic treats for rewards and snacks.

,
Get some weather-appropriate clothes.",How to Super Spoil Your Puppy," Look for one that contains coconut milk, as your dog requires a shiny pelt to look fresh. Clip their nails often, and brush their teeth regularly to keep them in check. Always blow-dry your pup after washing them, as nobody really likes the smell of a wet dog. Apply dog perfume for that added fragrance.;
, Get your puppy a big fluffy bed with lots of pillows, because if you find it comfy, so will your puppy. Perhaps even try getting cute matching nightwear.

, Take your puppy on a daily walk to stay healthy, as well as to relieve any stress the puppy may have. Make sure while on walks, you take a bottle of water on long walks and a poop bag to pick up any that they may do. Use a stylish leash for that extra class! Make sure you play with your puppy daily to keep the dog active.

Some people think using baby shampoo is okay, but even baby shampoo contains certain chemicals and oils that shouldn’t be used on dogs. Use a shampoo marketed and made specifically for puppies.Try to avoid buying a puppy shampoo with any added non-natural fragrances and dyes. If the label has anything like “Yellow No. 8” or “Tartrazine,” choose a different shampoo. These artificial ingredients can possibly cause allergic reactions or skin irritation.
Use shampoos that contain natural essential oils to provide fragrance, rather than chemicals.;
, For example, if your puppy has dry or itchy skin, you might consider getting a natural shampoo with oatmeal or essential oils like peppermint and eucalyptus added to soothe his itchiness.Medicated shampoos, like those made for controlling fleas and ticks, often cannot be used on puppies younger than 8-10 weeks. Make sure to read the labels on medicated shampoos to make sure they’re safe to use on your puppy at his age.

, Conditioner is important for dogs and puppies because it replenishes the natural oils in their coats that shampoos can wash away. Conditioner is also useful for detangling longer coats, and keeping skin moisturized and healthy.Never use conditioners meant for humans on dogs or puppies. Conditioners made for humans have a different pH level than those made for dogs, and can irritate their skin. Buy a conditioner made specifically for dogs. You can find them at your local pet supply store.

, Depending on the length of your puppy’s coat, you will need a brush to accommodate it. For example, longer coats might do better with a brush or comb that has bristles or teeth that are spaced a bit wider. These types of brushes and combs are good for eliminating the mats or knots that longer coats can acquire.Shorter coats, or coats that are prone to shedding, do well with closely spaced bristle brushes. This will help pull out shedding fur and keep your puppy’s coat healthy.

, You can find one of these at your local big box or hardware store. A shower head that detaches and has a hose will be the easiest method for showering your puppy, as it will extend down to where you puppy is in the shower and make it easier to rinse him.


Most of these types of shower heads allow you to twist a knob to turn off the water momentarily. To save water and keep the water from spraying everywhere while you soap up your dog’s coat, turn off the water pressure when you aren’t using the water.
This type of shower head will also let you use a gentler water pressure. You don’t want to use a high powered pressure setting. Use the light shower setting on your shower head when showering your puppy.

, You can judge that by touching it yourself. Just being warm to the touch is good enough. Adjust the water temperature as needed before putting your dog in the shower., Take your time and go slow. Let your puppy adjust to the temperature and to the feeling of the water hitting his body. Make sure you don’t have the sprayer set to a high pressure that might startle or hurt your puppy.Try talking softly to your puppy as you let him get used to the water. This might help keep him calm, and also reassure him that nothing bad is going to happen. It’s important he feels safe and comfortable so he doesn’t learn to fear showering or bathing.

, Get his entire coat nice and saturated with warm water. Don’t spray the water right into his face. Instead, gently tip his head back and aim the water down the back of his neck. You can use your hands to gently wet down his face to assure he doesn’t get water in his eyes.


Using your hose or sprayer, you can reach underneath your puppy’s body to make sure you get his underside wet as well. Again, it’s important to go slowly and not startle him.

, You can use just your hands, but using something like a sponge, washcloth, or even a special grooming mit will make it easier to spread the soap, and also help you avoid using too much soap. Lather up the soap gently with your hand or sponge, moving it in circular motions on the dog’s coat. Pay special attention to areas that are especially dirty, like legs and feet.It helps to start at the head and work your way back to the tail. This will pull dirt and grime down the dog’s body as you wash him, and make it easier to wash it out when you’re done shampooing.

, Make sure you don’t put soap or water into your puppy’s eyes or ears. Ears need to be cleaned with special ear cleaning solution, and your vet should provide you with instructions for this. Use a washcloth to gently wipe down your dog’s face to avoid getting soap in his eyes or mouth.If you get soap in your dog’s eyes unintentionally, rinse gently with clean water. Follow instructions on the label of the shampoo bottle should this occur.

, Again, make sure you tilt your puppy’s head back gently, and shield his eyes with your hand so no soapy water runs into them as you rinse. Start from his head, and rinse towards his back end. Run your hand over his coat to get all the suds out as you rinse. Make sure you rinse until the water runs soap-free.Make sure your dog’s toes get rinsed, too. If you have the bath water filled up, rinse his toes a second time once you’ve drained the water out.
Leaving soap in the fur can lead to irritation of your puppy’s skin, so it’s important that you get all the soap out when rinsing.

, Depending on the type of conditioner you bought, it might say on the label to let it sit for a minute or two so it can soak in and detangle and soften the coat. Follow the specific instructions on the label, rinsing again carefully afterward.


If your dog has a longer coat, use a wide-toothed comb to evenly distribute the conditioner through the coat. This will also help detangle your puppy’s coat as you work the conditioner in.

, You can even use a special pet-drying towel sold at many pet supply stores. Microfiber towels seem to offer the most absorbency when drying a wet pup. Start with your puppy’s head, as his wet face might be making him uncomfortable.Work your way down your puppy’s body, being careful not to mat his fur with rough drying motions. Make sure you dry his feet once you’ve carefully lifted him out of the tub or shower. Slippery wet feet could be dangerous for your pup if he falls or trips.

, There are many waterless shampoos on the market for dogs, and you can purchase them at your local pet supply store. Some come as sprays, others as foams, and most involve combing the shampoo through your puppy’s coat and then rubbing them dry with a towel or letting them air dry.Just like when looking for a regular shampoo, avoid purchasing a waterless shampoo with artificial dyes or fragrances. These might irritate your dog’s skin.

, Depending on the length of their coat, you’ll need to do this more or less often. The longer the coat, the more prone it will be to knotting and matting, so brushing every few days to every week will be important. Shorter coats can be brushed every few weeks to remove dead or loose hair from their undercoats.If your dog does have some knots or mats, use a bit of dog conditioner to detangle it and gently comb it out.
Make sure to brush in the direction of hair growth, rather than against the grain. Dogs don’t like their hair to be brushed in the wrong direction, and it could lead to worse knots rather than helping eliminate them.

, Use baby wipes, damp towels, or specially made dog wipes to wipe your puppy’s paws down after coming in from outside. You can also use these wipes or towels to wipe your puppy’s entire body down if he gets a bit dirty, or caught in the rain. This will keep them from tracking dirt inside, and will help slow down the accumulation of dirt on their coats between baths."

Look for diarrhea and vomiting.,
Check for a fever.,
Observe any respiratory issues.",How to Spot Health Problems in Newborn Puppies2," If your puppies are suffering from a bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection, the puppies will experience diarrhea and vomiting. This is a common symptom of most types of infections, particularly canine herpesvirus, parvovirus, and intestinal parasites. Be sure to visit your veterinarian immediately if your puppies experience any diarrhea or vomiting.There is a high mortality rate for puppies suffering from canine herpesvirus and parvovirus.

, If your newborn pups are suffering from an infection, they will run a fever. The healthy range for a dog’s temperature is between 99.5 and 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit (37.5 and 39.2 degrees Celsius), with anything over 103.5º F (39.7° C) considered a fever. You can rectally take your puppies’ temperature or an ear thermometer; however, that method is less reliable., A common symptom of many infections is sneezing, coughing, or eye discharge. These are all symptoms of an infectious agent causing respiratory complications. If your puppies exhibit any respiratory issues, take them to your veterinarian immediately.Respiratory issues can be symptoms of distemper or kennel cough.

Spot any physical birth defects.,
Be on the lookout for genetic disorders.,
Check for environmental complications.",How to Spot Health Problems in Newborn Puppies3," Some newborn puppies have abnormalities to their skulls, hearts, mouths, and anuses. These can include such things as cleft palates, deformations of the spine, or missing limbs.Certain abnormalities can make it difficult for them to nurse properly or generally be healthy. Birth defects may also cause the mother to reject or even kill the pups.Be sure to talk with your veterinarian about the best course of action for pups with birth abnormalities.
If your puppy suffers from a heart abnormality, it may struggle to gain weight, have trouble breathing, and be generally lethargic. Certain abnormalities can be treated if caught early., Newborn puppies often suffer from genetic disorders. These can range from cognitive issues to metabolic complications that severely limit a puppy’s quality of life. A puppy suffering from a genetic disorder will likely have difficulties nursing and properly gaining weight. However, they may also prevent behavioral issues, like aggression or sleeping away from the group. Be sure to talk with your veterinarian about the best course of action for any pups with genetic disorders.For example, newborn puppies can sometimes develop juvenile hypoglycemia, a genetic disorder that is particularly prevalent in toy breeds. This makes it difficult your puppy to properly gain and maintain a healthy weight.

, Newborn pups are extremely vulnerable to environmental factors like toxins or fluctuations in temperature. Because they are unable to regulate their body temperatures, they are susceptible to hypothermia and hyperthermia. Chemicals and toxins in their bedding or in the nearby environment can also harm puppies, poisoning them and affecting their health. If your puppies struggle to nurse, gain weight, and cry a lot, they may be experiencing a complication due to an environmental factor. The skin of newborn pups is thin and readily absorbs chemicals in the environment around it. This can result in flaky or dry skin and hair loss. Be sure to wash all bedding in gentle cleaners that leave no odor.
Make sure that you keep your dog’s whelping box in a climate controlled location to avoid any extreme temperature fluctuations.

Choose heavy-bottomed ceramic or stainless steel food and water bowls.,
Identify your dog to others.,
Get something to chew up.,
Be ready to block their way.,
Consider using a crate.,
Understand that arriving at their new home is going to be a big change for your dog.,
Know that you won’t be able to take your new puppy out for walks until they’ve had all the right jabs.,
Ask neighbouring dog owners to recommend a vet.,
Have a chat with your vet about treatment costs and pet insurance.",How to Take Care of a Brand New Puppy," Plastic bowls will probably end up as chew toys, and the tooth marks could become a haven for bacteria. A heavy bowl will also be harder for your dog (and you) to knock over by accident. If your dog has long ears that could dangle in their food and water, look for special narrow bowls to keep them clean and dry.;
, By law, all dogs must wear a tag on their collar showing their owner’s name and address. It’s a good idea to add your phone number too. You can order a tag over the internet or at your local pet shop.


Because collars can slip off or break, microchipping is recommended. It’s quick, painless, permanent and effective. Ask your vet to insert the chip and you’ll have a much better chance of being reunited if your puppy goes missing.
Check with the breeder or rescue home to find out if the puppy has already been microchipped, and ask them how to register the chip to your address. Unless you’re planning to breed from your dog, then you don’t need a dog licence.

, Dogs love chewing and a teething puppy will chew anything they can get their jaws around. So if you want to protect your socks, your shoes and your sofa, buy a selection of chews for your puppy to test their teeth on instead. Just make sure they’re non-toxic, durable and not too tough for puppy teeth. Never leave your puppy alone with anything that could choke them, splinter in their mouth or electrocute them.

, Stairs, balconies and ponds should all be out of bounds for an inquisitive puppy – and a strategically placed baby stair gate will do the job when you’re not there to supervise. A gate can also help you protect your furniture and possessions from your puppy’s unstoppable chewing instinct.

, You may have been given a travelling crate to bring your puppy home in. And as long as the crate’s big enough for your puppy to turn around in comfortably, it’s great for indoor use as well. Dogs hate to go to the toilet in their own bed, so a crate is a great toilet-training aid in those first few weeks when your puppy is adjusting to their new routine. You can also use it to take them in the car to explore new sights and sounds. At night, put your puppy to bed in their crate and, as long as you let them out at suitable intervals, they won’t mess on the floor.

, One of the kindest things you can do is to give them a bowl of the same food that they’re used to. It will make your dog feel welcome and secure.After that, you can decide what food you’d like to give them. By mixing the new food in with the old, little by little over a week or so, you can switch your dog’s diet to whatever you decide is best.

, Spend this time getting them used to wearing their collar and a lead. That way, it won’t be an issue when it’s time to explore the outside world. 


Collars and leads come in a variety of materials. Nylon or soft leather adjustable collars are recommended, as they’ll grow with your puppy. Adjust the buckle so that you can comfortably put a couple of fingers between the collar and your puppy’s neck. Check the fit regularly; you’ll be amazed at how fast they grow.  If you have a very small dog, like a small terrier or a toy breed you might prefer to use a harness – it makes it easy to protect delicate necks. (Remember to make sure your puppy still wears an ID tag.)

, As soon as your dog’s used to you and their new home, take them for a visit. Besides a general check-up, you’ll need to talk about worming, vaccinations and microchipping. Take some snacks along and make a big fuss of your dog. With the right vet and a positive attitude, a trip to the vet’s could be fun for your dog, rather than scary.

, Think about what level of cover you need, compare quotes and ask insurers about their claims process before you sign up to a plan.

Choose a collar.,
Let your puppy wear the collar for a little while.,
Distract your puppy when you put the collar on.,
Let your puppy wear the leash around the house.,
Hold the leash while your puppy walks inside.,
Train your puppy to start and stop.,
Teach your puppy to feel pressure.,
Complete your puppy's vaccinations.,
Adjust exercise time based on age.,
Allow your puppy to explore during your outside walk.,
Walk at a slow pace.,
Stand still if your puppy pulls in the opposite direction.,
Keep your puppy from lunging during walks.,
Stop your puppy from chewing on his leash.,
Get your dog to walk beside you.",How to Start Walking Your Puppy," Look for an adjustable nylon or leather collar. The exact collar you choose will depend on what type of dog you have. The collar should not be too tight or too loose. See if you can fit two fingers between the collar and your puppy's neck — if you can't, the collar is too tight.If you are having trouble choosing, speak with your veterinarian or a professional dog trainer.
Puppies grow quickly. Check the fit of the collar every two weeks.Avoid using slip collars, choke chains or prong collars on your puppy.;
, Your puppy may not like the feel of the collar at first. You may notice him trying to get out of the collar, scratching, or shaking his head. This is completely normal.It may take a few days for your puppy to get used to the collar.


Have your puppy wear the collar until he stops noticing it. Take the collar off once the puppy feels comfortable.
Time how long it takes for your puppy to stop noticing the collar. The next day, leave the collar on for a little bit longer.

, As soon as you put the collar on, give your puppy a toy or a treat to distract him. This will take his mind off of the collar. Praise your puppy each time he wears his collar. This lets him know that the collar is a good thing.


Always monitor your puppy when you are introducing him to a collar. You do not want him to choke or get it stuck on something.When your puppy is not distracted by his collar, it is time to move on to leash training.

, Attach the leash to his collar and let him walk around the house. This will help your puppy get used to the weight of the leash and the slight pulling. Play with your puppy during this time and offer him plenty of praise and a treat.Take the leash off for a few minutes and continue to play. Then attach the leash again.
Your puppy needs to associate the leash with play time and fun.

, Once your puppy is comfortable wearing the leash and the collar, do guided walks with your puppy. Hold the leash at your waist and have plenty of slack. You do not want to pull your puppy with the leash or put too much pressure on his neck.


Never yank your puppy towards you with the leash.Offer your puppy lots of praise and a treat when he does well with the leash.

, Get a firm grip on the leash and stand next to your puppy. Your puppy may move around for a little bit, but he will eventually sit still or lie down. Once your puppy is still, praise him or give him a treat. Then tell your puppy ""Let's go,"" and take a step. Your puppy will get excited and want to move more, but wait until he is still again. Reward and praise him for stopping. Once your puppy can start and stop with one step, begin to increase the amount of steps.


This teaches your puppy to start and stop when you stop and that you are in control.
Once you reach 6 or 7 steps in a row, you are really walking your puppy on a leash., If your puppy reacts negatively to you putting pressure on the leash, use treats to help him. Wave a treat and apply a little bit of pressure on the leash. When you apply pressure, gently pull the leash, but do not pull it so hard that your puppy is forced to come towards you. Your puppy will focus more on the treat than on the pressure around his neck.T


You may need to do this before you teach your puppy to start and stop with you.

, Your puppy should not be walking outside or going to dog parks unless he has been vaccinated. It is not safe for your puppy to come into contact with other animals.Your puppy will be done with his vaccinations at 14-16 weeks old.Typical vaccinations include the distemper/parvo (DHHP) and rabies. If your puppy will be around other dogs, he should get the Bordetella vaccination. Talk to your veterinarian about any other vaccinations your puppy may need.

, As a general rule, your puppy needs 5 minutes of exercise for every month of age. For example, a 4 month old puppy would need 20 minutes of exercise a day. However, the exercise needs of your puppy will vary based on the breed, energy level, and particular needs of your puppy. Consult your veterinarian to discuss the specific exercise needs of your puppy.Too much exercise can cause your puppy to become too tired and can hurt his development.Pay attention to how your puppy reacts to exercise. If he seems too tired, cut back. If he seems like he can continue, take him on an extra walk for 5 or 10 minutes.
Keep track of time when you take your puppy out for a walk.
Start with shorter walks and then build up as your puppy gets used to walking outside.

, Your puppy will be observing all of the surroundings when you take him out for a walk. Allow him to stop and sniff things. Take treats with you on your walk. Reward your puppy when he listens and exhibits good behavior.Walking outside is much different than walking around the house. Be patient with your puppy and allow him to adjust.
Your puppy will find all of his new surroundings stimulating. He may refuse to move or just stand still.
Don't allow your puppy to chew on sticks and acorns.

, Never jog or ride your bike when you walk your puppy. He is not ready for that fast pace and his joints are not strong enough. Wait until he is a year old before you start doing any of this.As your puppy approaches one, speak to your veterinarian about exercising with him.

, Your puppy may not want to follow your lead and begin to pull away from you. Instead of fighting your puppy, simply stand still. Do not move until your puppy comes back to you.Do not yank or drag your puppy in this situation.


If you tug against your puppy, he may start to think it is a game.
You can reward your puppy's good behavior with praise and/or a treat.
If your puppy won't stop pulling, you may start walking with a head halter or a front-hook harness.

, Your puppy may go after another puppy, a person, or a car when you take him out for a walk. Place your body in between your puppy and the object that he is trying to get to. You can also try to distract your puppy with a toy or treat when you see him lunging for something.If your puppy tends to lunge at certain things, distract him before he has the chance to lunge.
Use treats that your dog really likes and may not get often. This will provide a greater incentive.
Use a front clip harness instead of flat collar or back clip harness, you will have more control of your puppy.

, Your puppy may chew on his leash during a walk. He may be doing this for fun, to gain attention, or because he is nervous. You have several options to change this behavior.Use a chain leash instead of a fabric leash. Your puppy will not enjoy chewing on it as much.
If your puppy is chewing as a fun tug game, attach two leashes during the walk. When your puppy begins to chew on the leash, release it and guide him with the other leash. The leash will no longer have any resistance and the game will not be fun anymore.

, Set the tone for your walk by walking out of the house first instead of letting your puppy lead you. If your puppy becomes excited, stand still and wait until he calms down. If your puppy begins to pull on your leash during the walk and trying to go in a different direction, stand still and wait for him to stop moving. Once your puppy calms down, say ""Let's go"" and begin to walk.You are teaching your puppy that you are the leader.
Give your puppy a treat at your side when he is compliant. He will begin to stay there because he knows treats are at your side.

Learn about redirection.,
Give your puppy a chew toy to redirect his attention away from your hand.,
Play with your puppy.",How to Stop Puppy Biting2," Another useful training method to use for biting and other undesirable behaviors is redirection. With this training method, the goal is to redirect your puppy’s attention away from your hand or body onto something else that he is allowed to bite, such as a chew toy.Keep in mind that puppies are often teething at the same time that they are learning about not biting, so it is important to make sure that your puppy has appropriate chew toys. Doing so will help to alleviate some of the discomfort in his mouth while also teaching him good behavior.

, If your puppy starts biting your hand, one way to get him to stop is to offer him a chew toy to redirect his attention away from you. Keep a chew toy handy when you are spending time with your puppy to help teach him that it is okay for him to chew on a toy, but not on your hand., Another good redirection is to play with your puppy. Try playing tug-of-war with your puppy if he starts biting you. Or if your puppy prefers to play fetch, take your puppy outside and throw his favorite ball or Frisbee for him. Whatever your dog likes to do for play can be used as a redirection from biting."
"
Socialize your puppy.,
Discipline your puppy as needed.,
Exercise your puppy often.,
Contact a professional.",How to Stop Puppy Biting3," Puppy socialization is important to help your puppy learn normal dog behaviors.Socialization starts from a young age when your puppy is with its mother and other puppies. You take over socialization training after the puppy leaves its littermates and mom (around 8 weeks of age) up until it reaches 12-14 weeks of age. During this time, expose your puppy to other puppies, dogs, and cats, humans (of all shapes, sizes, and sexes) along with different situations such as car ride, parks, and the neighborhood activity.


All this socialization serves a purpose related to biting because a well socialized dog will know how to play with other dogs and will not bite at the first sign of a threat.

, Do not let your puppy get away with everything when you bring it home. Set clear boundaries such as where the puppy is allowed to be in the house, when it is allowed to eat, and what it can play with. If your puppy violates any boundaries, discipline him right away and be consistent.


For example, if the puppy is not allowed to get up on the furniture, tell your puppy “No!” and put him back on the floor right away.
Never strike your puppy. This will only instill fear in it and fearful puppies (and dogs) do not make good companions. Instead, discipline your puppy by teaching him what you want and then rewarding positive behavior. To reward your puppy, you can give him a small treat and lots of praise. If you puppy does something bad, then ignore him until the bad behavior stops.

, Make sure that your puppy is getting enough exercise and safe play every day. Puppies often bite or nip because they want to play or are bored. Teach your puppy that games like fetch, Frisbee and tug-of-war are acceptable for playtime.


Taking your puppy for a short walk once or twice a day is a good way for both of you to get exercise. Keep it short (less than 15 minutes) as young puppy’s bones and joints are still forming and longer walks can harm them. Do NOT take your puppy for jogs or runs until he is over a year old.
You should also have at least 15-30 minutes of playtime each day where the puppy can burn off some excess energy. Doing this will help your puppy focus a bit more during training sessions—including not biting—once he has calmed down from a good solid play period.

, If you are still having serious problems with puppy biting and none of the at-home methods you've tried seem to be working, consider taking your dog to a certified professional pet behaviorist or to a certified professional dog trainer. Many pet stores offer obedience courses run by trained professionals who can help you teach your puppy not to bite."
"
Set a routine.,
Systematically work toward getting your pup to sleep through the night.,
Play with your puppy.,
Drink a lot of coffee.

,
Take lots of pictures.",How to Survive Caring for a Puppy," Decide when the puppy will eat, sleep, go in the crate, and play. This will help make your puppy more predictable, and will also make housebreaking a little easier.;
, With crate training, the process goes as follows:Get your pup acquainted with the crate.
When he goes to sleep, set your alarm for 2-3 hours later (try to set it for before he'll need a potty break).
Take him to his potty area and encourage him to do his business. Remember: Potty, not party. Do not play, do not cuddle, do not give your pup the impression that overnight potty trips are good for anything but potty.
Take him back to his crate.
Repeat 2-3 hours later, again and again, through the night. This will be awful for you but it'll teach your pup that potty breaks happen on your schedule, not his. It will also hopefully avoid the situation in which he has to relieve himself so badly that he whines/yelps/barks desperately for your assistance with this matter.
Every night, increase the waiting period by 15 minutes. If the first night you did potty breaks every 2 hours, the next night do them every two hours and fifteen minutes, the next night every two hours and thirty minutes. Slow down if he ends up yelping or having an accident in his crate, though. Eventually he should be able to sleep through the night without a potty break.

, Not only will it tire out the puppy, but it will also make you smile and laugh, which will help reduce the stress that this puppy is creating.

,, Your puppy is growing right before your sleepy eyes, whether you realize it or not. One day you'll forget about the torture and miss the fuzzy cuteness, so document it.

Take them to the vet.,
Weigh them periodically.,
Supervise them.,
Isolate them from other animals.,
Find a foster mother.",How to Save Orphaned Newborn Puppies1," A vet should check the puppies within 48 hours of birth. The vet will examine them for cleft palates, birth defects, or other health issues. The vet may also be able to give you advice on how best to raise the orphaned puppies.


Ask your vet if they recommend a certain puppy milk substitute or if they can teach you how to properly feed the puppies.
Usually, the puppies would receive colostrum from their mother in the first 24-48 hours of birth. This important type of milk builds their immunity and gives them important nutrients. If they were unable to get colostrum from their mother, tell the vet. The vet may be able to provide them with blood plasma or serum from a healthy dog to have a similar effect.;
, A puppy’s weight can tell you how often to feed them, how much to feed them, and how well they are developing. Normally, a puppy will double their birth weight in the first eight to ten days. To weigh puppies, use an electronic kitchen scale or a postal scale. Weigh them once a day for the first two weeks. After that, weigh them on a weekly basis.The puppy may lose a little weight in the first 24 hours, but if any weight loss occurs after that period, you may want to contact a vet.Keep a chart of each puppy’s weight so you can see whether they have gained or lost weight.

, Puppies require constant care and supervision. Health problems can develop quickly and often require immediate supervision. Make a schedule for yourself so that you remember to feed and massage them at the proper times. You should also remind yourself to check their temperature often.


Don’t be afraid to handle the puppies. Picking up and giving them a light massage is not only relaxing, but it helps you determine if they are too cold. It can also help socialize them.Raising puppies by hand is a full time job. You may want to ask other family members, friends, or volunteers to help you so that you can rest.

, Puppies are extremely susceptible to viruses from other animals during this time, especially from other dogs. While it is treatable in adult dogs, canine herpesvirus can be fatal to puppies.Even if you don’t think your adult dogs are carrying any diseases, avoid introducing them to the puppies until they are five weeks old.

, Raising a puppy by hand is extremely difficult, and it can cause socialization problems with the dogs later in the life. If you can, try to find a foster mother for your puppies. This would be a mother dog that has had puppies around the same time that these puppies were born. You can contact local breeders, vets, animal shelters, and rescue organizations to see if they know of a dog that might work.If you find a potential mother, you should slowly introduce her to the puppies to see if she accepts them. If she does, she may even let them nurse from her. If she is aggressive or dismissive towards the puppies, remove them from her.

Provide a nesting box.,
Line the box with newspaper.,
Warm the room.,
Humidify the room.",How to Save Orphaned Newborn Puppies2," A nesting box should be large enough for the puppies to turn around in with sides high enough that they do not fall or climb out.You can use a cardboard box, which is easy to replace if soiled, or you can build a wooden nesting box.


If you bred the orphan puppies, you may already have a whelping box from when they were born. This can also double as their nesting box.
Keep this box in a dry, secluded area. Do not place it in the way of air conditioning drafts or too close to cold windows.Some decide to build smaller, separate boxes for each puppy. The benefit of this is that it allows you to care for each puppy individually, and it helps make sure that you do not forget a puppy.That said, by keeping the puppies in one box together, it may be easier to keep them warm and to socialize them. Decide which system works best for you.

, The puppies will not be housetrained, and they will soil the nesting box. Line it with newspapers so that you do not have to repeatedly clean the bottom of the box. You might also line it with a blanket that you can remove and wash. You will need to change the newspaper or blanket lining on a daily basis; you may need to change it more often if the puppies soil it.


Make sure there are no loose threads or holes in the blanket, which could trap the puppy. Do not use more than one blanket, for the same reason.

, Newborn puppies cannot regulate their own temperature. You will need to keep the nesting box and room warm so that their temperature does not drop. Keep the room around 90 °F (32 °C) until the puppies are one week old. Lower it to 85 °F (29 °C) for the second week, then drop to around 75 °F (24 °C) after that.


Instead of heating the entire room, hang a heat lamp over the nesting box. This will keep the puppies sufficiently warm.to prevent overheating, keep the heat restricted to one part of the nesting box, and make sure the puppy cannot touch the heat source directly.
If the puppies are scattered around the box, it may be too warm. If they are huddled in a heap, it may be too cold., To prevent dehydration, puppies will need an environmental room humidity of about 55-65% (more if they’re sickly or weak). You can place a humidifier in the room with the puppies to increase the humidity. You can also stick a damp towel in one side of the nesting box."
"
Create a feeding schedule.,
Decide between tube feeding and bottle feeding.,
Fill the bottle or syringe with a puppy milk substitute.,
Feed the puppy.,
Burp each puppy.,
Massage the puppy so they can eliminate.,
Wean the puppies.",How to Save Orphaned Newborn Puppies3," You will need to feed the puppies every three hours; if the puppies are weak or at a low weight, you may need to feed them every two hours. Write down a feeding schedule for yourself so that you do not forget. You may even want to set alarms on your phone to remind you.Puppies will often start to cry when they are ready to eat.

, There are two ways to feed puppies by hand: bottle feeding and tube feeding. Bottle feeding is easier, but it takes much more time. Tube feeding is recommended for weak puppies. It takes less time, but it must be done properly. Discuss with your vet the best options for your litter.



Bottle feeding takes more time per puppy. That said, bottle feeding may be a much safer and easier alternative for those with no prior experience with puppies.

Tube feeding is a faster method, and it is ideal for puppies with certain conditions, such as an inability to latch or a cleft palate. It delivers food directly to the puppy’s stomach via a syringe and tube. That said, if done improperly, it can cause respiratory problems. It is highly advised that you have a vet demonstrate how to tube feed before you try it yourself., Puppies cannot live off of cow’s milk. They will need a solution that is nutritionally similar to their mother’s milk. You can buy commercial puppy milk substitute, such as Just Born, Nurturalle, or Ilsaac, at a pet store. Commercial varieties come in both canned “ready to feed” and powdered forms. Powdered milk substitute is cheaper, but you will have to mix it with warm water first. Before feeding, warm the food in the microwave for three or five seconds until it is warm, but not hot.


Newborn puppies under 8 ounces (230 g) may have to be fed one cc of milk per ounce of weight while puppies above this weight can be fed one and a half ccs of food per ounce.Only prepare enough food for the day. Milk kept for longer than a day can attract bacteria.If you can't get a commercial product, make your own by mixing ten ounces of goat milk, one tablespoon light corn syrup, one cup of plain white whole milk yogurt, and one egg yolk.Only use this as a temporary food source until you can pick up a more nutritionally balanced, commercially prepared puppy formula.

, When it is time to feed the puppies, take them out of the nesting box one at a time. Let them eat slowly. If you notice milk coming out of their nose or mouth, stop immediately. Wipe away the milk, and check that they are breathing normally before continuing. If they are wheezing or sneezing, they may have inhaled milk. Contact a vet in this case.


If you are bottle feeding the puppies, set the puppy on your lap. Hold the bottle vertically, and let them suckle the milk. Do not squeeze the milk out; the puppy should naturally suck it out. The puppy will often stop eating when they are full.If you are tube feeding the puppy, you should attach a feeding tube to the syringe. Gently guide the tube to the back of the puppy's throat. Press down on the syringe slowly. It is highly recommended that you ask a vet to show you how to properly tube feed before you try it yourself., There is a chance air might have gone into the puppies' stomachs while they were feeding. This can cause stomach pain in puppies. To prevent this, burp the puppies after every feeding. There are two methods for burping puppies:


You can place them on your hand and massage their belly until they burp.You can rest them against your shoulder and pat their back., Puppies cannot defecate or urinate on their own at first. You will need to help them eliminate by massaging them either before or after each feeding. You can use a warm, damp cottonball, tissue, or washcloth. Gently rub around their anus and genitals until they defecate and urinate.You may want to wear gloves and an apron as you do this, as the puppies’ waste can get on you and your clothing.

, The puppies should begin to wean off milk at about three or four weeks of age. Mix or blend a little bit of puppy food with the puppy milk substitute. It should be soft and easy to swallow. Stick it in their mouth with your finger. They should naturally start to eat it. Slowly increase the amount of solid food that you give them. Your puppies should be eating solid food only by six weeks."

Hold them to look for hypothermia.,
Watch for symptoms of hypoglycemia.,
Check for dehydration.,
Begin deworming at two weeks of age.,
Vaccinate them.",How to Save Orphaned Newborn Puppies4," Because puppies cannot regulate their own body temperature, they may quickly lose heat and become cold. If you notice a puppy shivering or if their skin is cold to the touch, slowly warm them using your own body heat. Hold them close to you in your hands.The puppy will start to wiggle and move around when they are warm enough.
Do not feed a cold puppy milk. Warm them slowly before feeding.
Warming a puppy too quickly can send them into shock.

, Low blood sugar might occur in puppies who are not nursing from their mother. You may notice that the puppies are weak, limp, or cold. They may have bluish gums or twitching muscles. Take affected puppies to the vet to have dextrose administered to them., If the puppy has dry skin or sticky gums in the mouth, they may be dehydrated. You can prevent this by feeding the puppy regularly and providing a humid environment. If the puppy is severely dehydrated, take them to a vet immediately.Loss of skin elasticity is a major sign of dehydration. To check for this, pinch the puppy’s skin. If it sticks and does not return to normal, they may be dehydrated.

, It is often recommended that puppies be dewormed for roundworm and hookworm beginning at two weeks. This first round should be followed up with subsequent dewormings at four, six, and eight weeks of age.Your vet will most likely give the puppy a shot that kills any worms living inside the puppy. Oral medication is also sometimes used.

, Puppies are usually vaccinated for the first time between six and eight weeks of age. Puppies typically receive shots for distemper, parainfluenza, and bordetella at this time.Orphaned puppies may be especially vulnerable to parvo if they did not receive enough colostrum, the early mother's milk that bolsters the immune system. The vet may decide to vaccinate them for parvo at five weeks of age, especially if it is a significant risk in your region."

Identify the palate early.,
Go to the vet.,
Determine if the puppy needs to be separated from their litter.,
Create a 24-hour care schedule.,
Watch for signs of pneumonia.",How to Save a Newborn Puppy with a Cleft Palate1," As soon as the puppies are born, rub a finger on the top of their mouths. If you feel an indentation in their upper palate, it may be a cleft palate. Frequent sneezing and a “runny” nose after nursing may also indicate a cleft palate.If you notice that puppies are not suckling or if they are unable to eat, it is most likely a cleft palate. Puppies with cleft palates often will latch to their mother’s nipple, but they will be unable to suckle.;
, The vet will be able to determine how severe the palate is and whether it is a hard or soft palate cleft. The vet can also provide you with supplies for tube feeding the puppy.Puppies with cleft palates often have other defects as well. Make sure the vet does a full examination to catch any other potentially problematic issues.

, If the puppy is underdeveloped in other ways, they may be at risk if left with the litter. In some cases, you may be able to let the puppy remain with the litter. This is ideal, because puppies cannot regulate their own temperature and the heat from the mother dog keeps them warm. You might separate them if:


The puppy is too small and you’re worried they will be crushed by the other puppies
The mother dog rejects the puppy and refuses to feed or warm them.

, Puppies with cleft palates require around-the-clock care if they are to survive. This is because the puppies need to be fed by hand every two to three hours (including nighttime). If you have to separate the puppy from its litter, you will also have to keep the puppy warm and help them eliminate by hand.


Since cleft palate surgeries typically occur around the three month mark, you will need to continue your care schedule around the clock until the surgery occurs., Depending on the severity of the cleft palate, the puppy may be at risk for pneumonia or other respiratory diseases. These may be caused by the accidental inhalation of milk into their nose or lungs. You can prevent this by tube feeding the puppy instead of nursing or bottle feeding the puppy.Take the puppy to the vet immediately if you notice symptoms such as:


Sneezing
Coughing
Nasal congestion and runny nose
Labored breathing"

House train your puppy.,
Leash train your puppy.,
Socialize your puppy.,

Use positive reinforcement.,
Keep training sessions short.,
Be consistent and repetitive.",How to Train German Shorthaired Pointers," Basic commands will help your GSP behave properly. There a few commands every dog should know: sit, stay, come, and heel.Mastering these basic commands will give your GSP a foundation for learning more advanced skills.


Since GSPs are so intelligent, it probably won’t take long for your GSP to learn these basic commands.;
, GSPs were bred to hunt.If you do not intend to use your GSP to hunt wildlife, though, you will need to manage this hunting instinct. Otherwise, your GSP will bring you ‘trophies’ of dead animals, such as dead rats or rabbits.To redirect your GSP’s hunting instinct, give him toys to play with that will keep him busy for long stretches of time. For example, give him a Kong toy, which is a food puzzle.You can also play fetch and tug of war with your GSP. You could even have it chase you (in a playful way, of course).Your goal should not be to eliminate your GSP’s instinct to hunt. Rather, you should channel that instinct into something more appropriate for your living environment.

, Your GSP will need a lot of exercise each day. Without enough exercise, your GSP will come up with ‘creative’ ways to release its pent-up energy, which may result in some type of destruction (e.g., holes being dug throughout the backyard). Examples of exercises for your GSP are swimming, running, and playing fetch with a Frisbee. Plan to exercise with your dog each morning and evening.Hiking is another way to exercise your GSP.Long walks can also provide a good energy outlet for your GSP.

, GSPs have a tendency to bark a lot. If your GSP’s barking has become a problem, you will need to control when it barks and stays quiet. First, you will train your GSP to bark on command by saying ‘speak.’ Then, you will teach your GSP the ‘quiet’ command. With these 2 commands, your GSP will know when to bark and when not to.

, Crate training is an important aspect of training your GSP puppy. As with all puppies, GSP puppies need constant supervision. If you cannot watch your GSP puppy all day, then crate training will help keep it out of trouble when you're not around. After introducing your puppy to the crate and encouraging it to spend more time in the crate, your puppy will eventually see the crate as a place of safety and comfort.During the crate training process, make the crate comfortable for your puppy by putting toys and a blanket in the crate and placing a blanket or sheet on top of the crate.The blanket or sheet on top of the crate will make it feel like a cozy den to your puppy.
Crate training has several benefits. It will keep your puppy out of trouble while you are away from home and will make housetraining a little easier. As your puppy matures into an adult, the crate can become a defined sleeping area.Pick a crate size that is large enough for an adult GSP. A 36 x 36 inch (91 x 91 cm) crate would be a good size.Some crates have an adjustable interior so you can increase the amount of space in the crate as a puppy grows.
Do not rush the crate training process. It may take your puppy a few weeks, or even a few months, before it’s comfortable staying in the crate for long time periods.

, Crate training and house training go hand in hand—your GSP puppy will not want to eliminate where it sleeps (in the crate), so your puppy will learn to eliminate only outside. Create a bathroom schedule for your puppy and follow it consistently. Your puppy should eliminate outside after waking up, before bedtime, and after eating, drinking, or playing.Let your puppy choose an area outside to eliminate and always take it to that area. Your puppy will leave its scent in the area.Give your puppy lots of verbal praise when it eliminates outside. This will reinforce to your puppy that going to the bathroom outside is the right thing to do.
If your puppy has an indoor bathroom accident, clean it up without punishing him. Use an enzymatic cleaner to remove the scent of ammonia so your puppy doesn’t eliminate in that spot again.GSP puppies can hold their bladders for about 1 hour per month of age. Consider hiring a pet sitter or dog walker who could take your puppy out twice during the day when you’re not home.

, GSPs are fully of energy, especially as puppies. All of that energy could make leash walking a daily challenge. Teaching your GSP to walk on a leash will make walks more enjoyable for both of you. First, allow your puppy to become used to wearing a collar. Your puppy may try to take it off at first, but will eventually become used to it. You can then attach a leash to the collar and let your puppy walk around the house with the leash on.If your puppy starts to pull when you go on walks outside, do not jerk the leash. Instead, stop walking and call your puppy back to you. You can also start walking in the other direction. Your puppy will soon realize that it should follow you.
Giving your puppy periodic treats during the walk will help reinforce good leash behavior. Reward your puppy when it does not pull on the leash.

, Socialization is a critical aspect of dog training. It allows a dog to become comfortable with people, other pets, and new experiences. Since GSPs can be wary of other dogs, early socialization will help your GSP puppy become comfortable meeting and interacting with new dogs.Socialization should take place between 3 weeks and 3 months of age.Strategies for socializing your puppy include regular introductions to friendly people and going to busy parks.The more people (and pets) your puppy can meet during the socialization period, the more well-adjusted it will be as an adult.
Wait until your puppy is fully vaccinated before going to a dog park. Otherwise, your puppy could get exposed to a disease at a dog park that could make it very sick. Your vet can recommend a good age for him to go to a dog park. Feel free to take him to ‘people’ parks.
Dogs that are not properly socialized will be fearful of new situations and act inappropriately around people and other pets.

, Puppy kindergarten class is a great way to socialize your puppy. Your GSP puppy will learn how to interact with other dogs in a playful, yet controlled environment. In puppy kindergarten, your puppy will also start learning some basic commands.Ask your veterinarian or other dog owners about puppy kindergarten classes in your area.

, Positive reinforcement encourages a dog to continue doing the right thing. Examples of positive reinforcement are verbal praise, treats, and extra petting. Your GSP will work hard for your positive reinforcement.The more positive reinforcement your GSP receives, the more likely it will follow commands correctly and behave well.


Positive reinforcement can also add energy and enthusiasm to your training sessions.
Do not use negative reinforcement, such as yelling or physical punishment.GSPs are very sensitive to human reactions, so yelling or physical punishment will negatively affect your GSP., GSPs are very intelligent and quickly learn new tasks, but get bored very easily. Keeping your training sessions short—no longer than 15 minutes—will help prevent this boredom. End each training session on a high note and give your GSP positive reinforcement for a job well done.GSPs also get easily distracted. Smelling something different in the air could be enough to distract your GSP from the task at hand.Short training sessions could help your dog stay focused for short bursts of time.

, When you teach your GSP new tricks or commands, consistency and repetition are key to ensuring mastery of a certain task.Since your GSP is prone to distraction, hearing a command multiple times may be necessary to maintain focus.


To counteract the distraction, offer your GSP plenty of treats.The smell of a tasty treat in your hand will help your GSP refocus its attention on you.

Bernese Mountain Dog tend to be very mild tempered and obedient but they, like all dogs, will take some time to train.Hitting it will only make the puppy fear you and confuse her — never strike your dog. If you in the middle of a training session and she doesn't fully understand, do not become impatient and scold her. After all, the puppy or dog is only learning.


If you find that you are losing your patience, step away from the dog and try again later.
Bernese Mountain Dogs are extremely affectionate and want to please — scolding or punishing may have an extremely detrimental affect on your Bernese. Focus on positive reinforcement instead of punishment.;
, This could be with a tiny tasty treat or just praise as the dog develops. If the dog knows he gets a treat for good behavior, and bad behavior is ignored, then he is likely to reproduce good behavior it was rewarded for.When you catch your dog or puppy chewing or destroying something he shouldn’t, remove either the dog or the object from the dog and distract him with something it can “destroy” or chew on, like a toy. Then praise him for chewing on the right thing — the toy.
Keep a bag of treats in a Ziploc bag in your pocket or in a “fanny” type bag at your waist. This means you will always have a treat handy. You never know when an opportunity to train will pop up during the day!

, During the first few weeks of training a puppy’s attention span is short, usually less than five minutes. As your puppy gets older and starts to associate training times with pleasant interaction with you, the training time can be increased.You will know the dog's attention span is increasing when the puppy focuses more on the training sessions than on wandering off and playing.

, You can teach your puppy commands from the moment she arrives home. Keep training sessions short (less than five minutes) and practice three to five times a day. Your Bernese Mountain Dog should be able to learn a variety of commands. Start with leash etiquette and commands that limit bad behavior, and move on to more specific commands.

, It essential that you train your dog a command for when you want him to stop doing something. ""Stop"" or ""leave it"" are common commands — whichever you choose, make sure that you are consistent and that everyone in the household uses the same command. When you see your dog doing the unwanted behavior, first give the command, then immediately follow with action (taking away the item or moving your dog away from it). By giving the command first, then doing the corrective action, you will give your dog the opportunity to do what you want when he hears you say ""leave it"" and avoid an unpleasant consequence., Puppies explore their environment by mouthing everything in sight. While these are natural behaviors for a puppy, you also don't want her to think it's okay to bite people or chew on your shoes. Your dog will not know what is appropriate for her to chew unless you teach her.


Keep anything you don't want your puppy to destroy up and out of her reach (this includes trash, books, shoes, remote controls, glasses, dirty underwear, etc.). Have plenty of toys for her to play with and chew on, but make sure they are not indistinguishable from household items (your dog will not know the difference between an old sock you offer her to play with and a new sock she is not supposed to chew).
Allow your puppy to mouth you, so long as it is gentle. When your puppy gives you a hard bite, give a high-pitched yelp, as though she's really hurt you, and let your hand go limp (don't jerk it away). Your dog should stop biting, at which point you should praise her for stopping. If she bites you hard again, repeat these steps. Do this no more than three times in a 15-minute time period.Give your dog a chew toy when she wants to chew on fingers.
If you find your puppy chewing on something she shouldn't be, take it away and give her a toy to chew instead. As you take the item away, say “leave it” and give her a toy to chew on.Do not punish your dog after the fact. If you find an item that your dog destroyed while you were away, don't wave it in her face while yelling at her. This won't teach her not to chew — she will not get the connection that you are angry about something she did two hours ago. Unless you catch her in the act, do not scold your dog., Most dogs can learn this command quickly with little trouble. Start out by observing your dog — when you see that he is in the process of sitting on his own, say ""sit"" clearly and in a firm voice.As soon as his butt touches the ground, praise him, pet him, and give him a treat. Do this every time you spy your dog about to sit.Another method is to sand in front of your dog with a treat in your hand. Hold the treat centimeters above your dog's nose, then move the treat backwards, over his head, leading his nose. He should follow the treat with his nose and should sit down as he does this. Again, as soon as his butt hits the floor, give him the treat and praise him.Once your dog has the motion down, say ""sit"" just before you begin to lead his nose back with the treat., Puppies jump to your attention or while playing. This may be cute when your Bernese is little, but they grow into huge dogs, and she may injure or scare people if she jumps when she is full grown. Teach her not to jump when she is a puppy to avoid problems later on. If your dog has already mastered ""sit,"" this can make teaching her not to jump a lot easier. When she's in a situation in which she is likely to jump — meeting a new person, for instance, tell her instead to sit and reward her with your attention.When you see your dog is going to jump up on you, turn your body away, deflecting her, avoiding eye contact, and saying nothing. She will get the message that, when she jumps on you, she gets no reward or attention. Once she stops jumping and calms down, praise her with lots of petting, attention, and scratching., Once your Bernese knows how to sit, you can teach him the ""down"" command. Ask your dog to sit, then hold the treat in front of his nose. Lower the treat to the ground — he should follow with his nose, lowering his body; you can praise him as he moves toward the down position. When his belly touches the ground and he laying down, reward him with the treat and more praise. Once he is familiar with the movement, add the verbal command. ""Down,"" ""lay,"" or ""drop"" are common commands. Say it just before you begin bringing the treat down.Eventually, with practice, your dog will make the association between the action and the word ""down.""

, This can be a difficult command to train, as your dog will naturally want to follow you around. Teach this command to your dog once she has learned to sit and lay down. Begin teaching your dog to stay when she is calm (try after a walk), in a familiar environment, and with few distractions. Keep these sessions short at first, as it will be a challenge for her to stay in the beginning.


Stand in front of your dog and ask her to sit or lay down. If she remains in the position for a few seconds, quickly reward her with a treat. This signals that she is released from the position and may do something else.
Repeat the process and wait a few seconds longer before rewarding your dog. If she breaks the stay before you have released her (by rewarding her with the treat), say ""ah-ah!"" And start over.
Add the verbal command. When your dog is sitting or laying down, say ""stay"" and put one hand out like a stop sign. Wait a few seconds, then reward her with the treat. Gradually increase the length of the stay. Do this slowly, and don't make these training sessions too long or your dog may get frustrated.
When your dog seems to be grasping stay, you'll need to complicate things a bit more. Because you want her to stay in position even when you are out of sight (if you ask her to sit and stay while you go in a store, for instance), begin taking a few steps back from your dog after commanding her to stay. If she breaks the stay, she does not get the treat.
Some argue that this is not a necessary command — your dog should know that when you tell her to sit or stay, she should remain in that position until you release her.

, The stay command is an important command for your dog's safety — it can stop him from dashing into a busy street or another dangerous situation. Never let your dog off the leash outside (in an unfenced area) until he knows the ""come"" and ""stay"" commands and does them consistently.To practice this command, leash your dog and have some treats handy.


Holding the end of the leash, say ""come"" in a very welcoming voice, then quickly take a few steps backwards. Continue to back up until your dog reaches you. Reward him by saying ""Yes!,"" then give him a treat. You can also practice this off-leash. Crouch or kneel and call your dog over to you throughout the day, rewarding him greatly when he comes to you.
Never punish your dog when he comes to you. This could mean giving him a bath or shouting at him for not coming when you called, or even just ending his fun by snapping his leash back on every single time he obeys. Coming to you when you call needs to be the most appealing option your dog knows — more appealing than chasing that rabbit or running across the street to say hi to the neighbor.Your dog must understand that he must come every single time you call him. When you are training, don't put him in a situation in which you know he won't obey you and then try the come command., Teaching your Bernese Mountain Dog proper leash etiquette is very important — a big dog like a Bernese could easily drag you down the street if she isn't trained. Start out by letting her get comfortable with her collar. Put it on when she's likely to be distracted, like when she's playing or eating food.If she tries to scratch it off or remove the collar, do not allow her to do so. Do not remove the collar until she's forgotten about it.Once your Bernese is used to wearing her collar, clip on a lightweight leash. Don't try to lead her or do anything with it — let her just drag it around the house (under your supervision) and sniff it., Once your dog feels comfortable with his collar and leash, take the leash and begin walking around the house with him. If he walks beside yo and/or lets the leash be loose or slack, give him praise, pets, and treats. If he begins to pull, stop in your tracks. Do not pull him back to you and do not proceed — allow him to come back to you. When the leash is loose again, praise him and begin walking again.Never allow your puppy to pull you on the leash, as this teaches him that this is acceptable. By stopping the walk, he learns that pulling and straining will get him nowhere. If he wants to walk, he must do so without pulling.If your puppy does the opposite and sits down, do not yank on the leash to get him to keep moving. Instead, call him over to you, offering treats and rewards when he comes., Potty training, or house training, starts the moment your Bernese Mountain Dog sets foot in your house. When you first arrive at your home, let him sniff around the yard until he goes to the bathroom.When the dog does urinate or defecate, give him lots of praise so he associates going to the bathroom outside with being praised.

, Take your puppy outside on a regular basis. Puppies, in particular, need to go to the bathroom quite frequently. They will not always give you a clear sign that they need to relieve themselves, so taking the dog outside on a regular basis will give the dog the chance to go to the bathroom when she needs to.If you can really set a routine, your dog's digestive system will get used to the schedule and she will go to the bathroom like clockwork.

, Have him go to the bathroom in one specific spot every time. This will solidify the fact that the dog needs to go to the bathroom outside if he has one spot that is his own spot.

, When you’re inside your house with your puppy, watch her carefully for signs that she needs to go potty. Panting, pacing, sniffing around, or barking are all signs she needs to go outside to potty.


Immediately rush your puppy outside and let her go to the bathroom. When she does, lavish her with praise as soon as she relieves herself.

, If you fail to catch the dog's signal, and a potty accident occurs, don’t scold or hit the dog — he won't make the association that you are angry because he went to the bathroom in the wrong place. Instead, quietly clean up the mess and try again.


Scolding the dog will only make the dog fearful and secretive when he goes to the bathroom. Your dog will go to the bathroom in places that are hard to spot.

, You will need to confine your puppy to a small space (bathroom, mud room, laundry room) with an easily cleaned floor if you can’t be with her or when she isn’t under your constant eyesight. Crate or kennel training your puppy is one of the best ways to potty train a dog. As an added bonus, it also gives the puppy a safe retreat when she needs a break from life in general., You will need to purchase a crate that is appropriately sized to fit the size your dog will be as an adult.Bernese Mountain Dogs are very large, so you will need to purchase a large crate. A crate that is about 60""x36"" or 72""x36"" should be large enough for your dog.If your Bernese is hunched over or can't turn around comfortably in the crate, then you need to buy a bigger crate for him..

, The dog should have access to the crate at all times, as the goal is to make it a place the dog goes to when she needs a break. Put the crate in your living room or kitchen with the door open and crate pad or a blanket inside.

, Encourage the puppy to go into the crate on her own by tossing a treat or toy inside. Do this throughout the day for a few days, always leaving the door open. Once she is comfortable inside the crate, close the door after she goes in. Allow her to come out of the crate only after she has been quiet for 10 minutes — do not let her out if she is whining or pawing at the door.


Increase the amount of time the puppy spends in the crate until she is able to stay quietly in the crate for up to two hours. When she is older than four months, she can stay in the crate for up to four hours.
Never leave your dog in a crate for longer that four hours (or two hours if she is under four months old).
Never use the crate as punishment. The crate is meant to be your puppy's safe haven, not somewhere she goes when she's been bad.

, Dog socialization means learning to be a part of human and dog society in a healthy manner. Bernese Mountain Dogs are known to be a little aloof, so socializing in the first year of life is especially important.While it’s an important part of any puppy’s training, for a giant breed of dog it’s imperative.


Begin by introducing the dog to normal household noises and activity in a non-threatening manner. Don’t tease your puppy by chasing it with a broom or vacuum. This will only make it fear these things and maybe even you., Take your puppy for car rides to get it used to riding in vehicles and to introduce them to street sights and sounds through the windows. Dog parks (with your puppy safely leashed) are another good way to interact with other dogs and humans.


Puppies can be brought to these places after they have had their first two distemper vaccines. Do not let your puppy off leash unless you are certain it will get along with other dogs and humans., One of the most productive ways to introduce a puppy to other puppies, humans, and normal sights and sounds is to take them to puppy socialization or obedience classes (for older dogs). These classes are held by community education, 4-H clubs, or pet shops and give the dogs and owners a safe place to learn together.


Look through your local newspaper or on-line to find classes near you. Your veterinarian’s office may also know of any classes available."

Teach your dog to bark on cue and to not bark.,
Teach the puppy to catch ball.,
Teach the puppy to focus.,
Give directions ""in the air"".,
Teach your puppy to spin.",How to Train a Saint Bernard Puppy," The barks should be controlled and you should be able to count them:


Think of the cues you wish to use. Don 't precede your teaching with ""what is"", as the puppy may begin to bark before you have said the number.
Combine a signal with a word command. For instance, make a hand/head signal that is very visible as you request the dog to bark and stop barking:

Say "" Rover, bark!"" and nod your head deeply.
Say ""Rover, stop! and nod as obviously again.


Use different cue words and signals, as suit your needs, as long as they're consistent.
Repeat this over a couple of training sessions until the puppy response to your signals alone. It can be useful to give the signal first, then the word command, followed by a treat if the dog response after the signal.
This of course, as with any trick, must be taught in progressive stages. In order for this trick to be most successful in front of an audience, your puppy needs to be trained to observe the smallest of signals.You can then slowly diminish your head/hand signals as the training progresses, so that you can merely flick your hand and the cue works to set off and stop the barking. This will only come with practice.;
, This is a fun activity for regular playtime, yet it also improves your puppy's coordination and focusing skills. This 'game' evolves out of the regular ball throw and retrieve.


Start by having the ball in your hand, and the puppy sitting in front of you.
Hold the ball and let the puppy take it out of your hand.
Play around with this, giving the puppy the ball, and taking it back again.
After a while, start rolling the ball into the puppy's mouth, and then throw it from a really short distance. The purpose here is to not simply throw the ball and have the poor puppy get hit on the head, consequently dodging all balls being thrown at him for all eternity. Instead, start slowly, and throw the ball really slowly, in a nice upward curve. Once the puppy gets the basic catch down, you can make it more challenging. The ball catch can even be the basis for fancier Frisbee throws.

, Here you get your puppy to focus on you for a limited time by looking at you, and then reward him with a treat. Make sure your hands are hidden, so he won't be inclined to look at them instead.


Start with sitting on your knees (this is easier for a little puppy to look at your face, but you can also stand if you want more authority)
Call the puppy over to you, making him sit and saying ""Rover, focus.""
When you have the puppy's attention, make him hold it for a couple of seconds and reward.
You can then slowly lengthen the time to 5 seconds and beyond.
If the puppy's concentration breaks and he stops looking at you, call him again with the phrase ""Rover, focus"" and shorten the time you have the puppy focus.

, This is a good method for achieving barely perceptible commands. Just gently blow in the directions of the puppy's ear when you give a command to perform a trick. The dog will learn to associate this with being a discreet signal to perform something. Keep practicing.

,


With the puppy standing in front of you, hold out a doggie treat and show it to your puppy.
Hold it so your puppy can't just take it out of your hand.
Now lead the puppy with the treat in a circle while saying ""Spin"".
After the puppy completes the rotation, give him the treat, and praise him. Something like ""Good SPIN!"" is fine. Repeat.
After a couple of training sessions, try it without a treat, by just having the puppy follow your finger. Finally this evolves into a simple finger spin and the vocal spin command.

Weigh the puppy.,
Prepare the puppy milk substitute.,
Fill the syringe.,
Attach a feeding tube to the syringe.,
Press down on the syringe slowly.,
Burp the puppy.,
Massage the puppy to help them eliminate.,
Repeat every two to four hours.",How to Save a Newborn Puppy with a Cleft Palate2," How much you feed the puppy will depend on how much they weigh. If you are using a brand of puppy milk replacer, they may have directions on the side of the box. Otherwise, you can follow these general guidelines:


If they are under eight ounces of weight, you should feed them one cc of milk per ounce of weight.
If they are between 8 and 24 ounces, you should feed them one and a half cc of milk per ounce of weight.
If they are over 28 ounces, you should feed them one ounce of milk per pound of weight., You can buy powdered or premade puppy milk replacer at a pet store, vet’s office, or online. You can also make your own. Prepare the milk substitute according to its directions, and place it in the microwave to heat it up for 3 to 5 seconds. Make sure that the milk is warm, but not hot, before feeding the puppy.


You can make homemade puppy milk substitute by mixing 10 ounces of goats milk, one tablespoon light corn syrup, one cup of plain white whole milk yogurt, and one egg yolk. Always use whole (not low-fat) dairy products.Just Born, Nurturall, and Esbilac are all commercial brands of puppy milk. You can buy these in pre-prepared cans or in powder form.
If you cannot get puppy milk replacer or make a homemade substitute in the first 24 hours, you can use pedialyte instead. This is not a long term solution, however., In general, you should use a 12 cc feeding syringe (or a syringe without the needle). Using the measurements on the side, fill it with the proper amount of milk substitute based on the puppy’s weight.

, This is a long tube that will be placed down the puppy’s esophagus. Once you have attached it, draw a little formula through the tube until a drop or two comes out the other side. Place this tube in the puppy’s mouth. They may suck on the end of the tube, helping you slowly guide the tube to the back of their throat.If you have never tube fed a puppy before, ask your vet to show you how to properly do this part. Your vet may be able to provide you with a feeding tube, and they can mark on the tube exactly how far the tube should go.

, Lay the puppy on your lap with one hand behind the puppy’s head. Hold the syringe vertical above the puppy’s head, and slowly press down on the plunger. If you go too quickly, the milk might go up into their nose or they might get air in their stomach. If you notice milk dribbling out of their nose or mouth, stop.Once you are done, pinch the end of the tube, and quickly remove it from the puppy’s mouth.

, Hold the puppy up against your shoulder, with their belly against your shoulder and their head on your shoulder. Gently pat their back until they burp. This will help release any air that accidentally got in their stomachs during tube feeding., Typically, the mother licks the puppy to help the puppy relieve themselves before or after nursing. In the mother's place, you will have to do this instead. Take a warm, damp washcloth, cottonball or tissue. Gently rub around the puppy’s genitals and anus until they urinate and defecate.If you cannot get the puppy to eliminate after nursing, you might try doing this beforehand.

, Newborns may need to be fed every two hours for the first week or two. After that, you can start feeding them every three to four hours. By the time they’re 12 ounces, you can start feeding them every five hours."

Find an experienced animal hospital.,
Monitor the cleft palate.,
Protect their mouths after surgery.,
Feed them soft foods.",How to Save a Newborn Puppy with a Cleft Palate3," Not all vets perform cleft palate surgery. If yours does not, find a local animal hospital that not only performs these surgeries but has a high success rate. Some dogs might require multiple surgeries, but with an experienced surgeon, this chance decreases.Ask your vet for a referral. They will probably know of an animal hospital that can help.
Cleft palate surgeries are very difficult on young animals, and your vet will probably want to wait until they are three to four months old. Some surgeries may not take place until the puppy is eight or nine months old.

, Some cleft palates may close on their own. If your vet advises you to wait until the puppy is older, you should check the palate frequently to see how it is healing. If you think that the palate is growing wider, you should call the vet to consider your options., Your puppy will likely be required to wear an Elizabethan collar for one or two weeks after the surgery. This is to protect their mouths. In addition, you should avoid giving them toys, hard foods, treats, or other objects that they will put into their mouth.If you notice the puppy playing with their sutures or chewing on something they shouldn’t, try to distract them. Call their name, clap your hands, or pick them up and remove them from that spot. This can help prevent a second surgery.

, To protect their sutures, you will not be able to feed them hard kibble, treats, or other foods for at least two weeks. Do not feed them any food that they have to chew. Your vet will have specific instructions for their post-surgery diet.If they have a soft palate cleft, you can feed them canned food for two weeks.
If they have a hard palate cleft, you will need to blend their food. You will need to feed them by hand or by feeding tube.

Introduce puppies between 3 and 20 weeks of age.,
Take the pup to puppy classes.,
Make socialization pleasant for your puppy.",How to Socialize a Puppy from a One Pup Litter1," Puppies are naturally playful and curious, and they develop quickly during the period between 3-12 weeks. It’s important to socialize them during this formative time; once your puppy has reached 21 or 22 weeks of age, it will no longer be developing as quickly.Failing to socialize your puppy during this crucial stage may result in an adult dog that lacks important social skills.


It’s important that you introduce your pup to others around the same size and weight, especially when yours is 3-8 weeks old. If you introduce your small pup to a much larger, older puppy, the larger dog could potentially knock down or hurt yours in the excitement of playing.;
, Puppy classes are specifically designed to allow pups to meet one another, and to play together in a safe, supervised environment. These socialization spaces can go a long way towards familiarizing your dog with other pups of its own age, and can replicate the social environment that your pup would’ve gotten with its litter-mates.Puppy classes are often offered by large pet stores, such as PetSmart and Petco. Also ask your veterinarian and the staff or owners of your local pet store if they know of any local puppy classes. Finally, look at the vet’s office and pet store for posted signs or flyers advertising puppy classes.
However, before considering a puppy class, make sure that your pet has had all necessary vaccinations. If any of the pups at the class haven’t been vaccinated, they pose serious health risks to the other animals.
If there are no puppy classes in your area, reach out to your friends and acquaintances. It’s likely that one or more of them have puppies and would be happy to socialize the animals together.

, The entire purpose of socialization will be defeated if your puppy finds the process overwhelming or scary. When socializing your puppy with other dogs, always make sure that your pup is having a good time—playing, wagging its tail, barking—and does not feel overwhelmed or threatened.If you’re exposing your puppy to new dogs and the puppy huddles in the corner, either remove your pup from the situation or have some of the other dogs/puppies leave. You don’t want your puppy to associate other dogs with feelings of fear and anxiety.

Be patient.,
Start simply.,
Expose them to distractions.,
Take your dog on many walks.,
Take your dog in the car to many places.,
Introduce your puppy to older dogs that you are familiar with.,
Always take your dog places.,
Always allow your dog to play with other dogs.",How to Socialize a New Puppy," It is important to know that it will take a lot of time and patience before your puppy is completely socialized, so be patient and allow time and mistakes!;
, In a quiet place in your house, train your dog to do simple tasks, such as sitting, laying down, and giving a handshake. Be sure to be consistent, and give lots of praise when they get it right. Teaching them simple tasks will help them to trust you and make them behave better around people.

, Start to practice the tricks in louder places to accustom them to the many sounds of the real world.

, Use the flexi-leash around your neighborhood, and a short leash whenever you are around other dogs or people. It is dangerous to let them run far out when there are people and other animals around. Once they are socialized, you can begin using the flexi-leash.

, To the dog park, the vet, any place they will ever need to go. Never limit the car rides to veterinarian visits, for your puppy will dread the car!

, Make sure they are submissive towards the dog, if they aren't, that could lead to aggression. Make sure your puppy sits, and let the other dog approach yours first.

, If you limit them to the house, they will never get used the the outdoors and humans and other dogs, which is not a good thing if you want a well-socialized puppy.

, Only break them apart if you see growling, teeth baring, or extreme biting. Scold your dog firmly if they are the instigator or the fighter, or get your dog far from the scene if it another person's dog. Be very careful when getting your dog out of a situation. It can be VERY dangerous.

When you bring home your puppy, feed him the same food he’s been eating at the breeder’s to minimize digestive upsets.,
Housebreak your Newfoundland puppy.,
Socialize your puppy by taking him everywhere with you.,
Start training your Newfoundland puppy as early as possible so you don’t end up with a 125-pound dog that you can’t control.,
Groom him.,
Be prepared for the drool.,
Spend lots of time with them.",How to Raise a Newfoundland Puppy," Ideally you should continue with this food until your pup reaches adulthood, since most breeders put a lot of thought into the type of food they recommend for puppies.


The rapid growth rate of Newfoundland requires a food with up to 24 percent protein and 15 percent fat to support their growth. Feed Newfoundlands, both puppies and adults, at least twice per day.;
, Even one accident by a 25-pound puppy can leave a big mess. Get a wire crate that will be large enough for your pup when he’s an adult, and block off part of it so that he is confined to a space just large enough for his comfort. It’s natural for him to want to keep his crate clean; so he'll try to hold his bowels. Let him out often, and always after he eats.

, Newfies are naturally sweet dogs, but unusual situations or strange animals and people can frighten or upset them. A scared or aggressive Newfoundland is a handful -- so get him used to the world outside the back yard as early as possible.


If your dog is well socialized he’s unlikely to resist when it’s time to take a trip to the vet, to interact with other animals or to meet strangers. By going out and experiencing many different people and situations, your Newfoundland puppy will learn to accept and tolerate a variety of animals, people and situations.

, Do wait until your vet gives the okay for your pup to socialize so he’s not at risk for diseases. Newfies are generally intelligent, happy and willing workers, and you can expect that your puppy will enjoy his training sessions with you. Enroll him in a kindergarten puppy class to provide both socialization and a structured framework for teaching him good manners. Your puppy will learn essential obedience commands, such as “come,” “sit” and “stay.”

, Regular, thorough grooming is essential to prevent matting and keep their coats in good condition. You will need to have the time to devote to grooming. Bathing a Newfoundland is a major undertaking too and you are likely to have to do that more often than you think, given the Newfoundland's love of getting wet and muddy. A 'blaster' is an essential piece of equipment.

, If you find slobber or drool disgusting and cannot accept or handle it, a Newfoundland is probably not the breed for you. Most people are unprepared for how just how much Newfoundlands slobber and drool, especially after eating or drinking. When they shake their heads, you will literally be toweling saliva and slime off your clothes, furniture, and walls. Keeping a 'slobber cloth' close at hand is probably going to have to become second nature.

, Newfoundlands are one of the most devoted of dog breeds, it's one of the great attractions of Newfies. They want and need to be with you and because of that they are not a suitable breed to be left alone for any length of time. If you work all day and your dog is going to be left alone, a Newfoundland is not the breed for you.

Get an appropriate collar.,
Focus on reward-based training.,
Be a strong leader.Doberman need firm handling.,
Practice consistent training.The key to training is teaching your dog through repetition.",How to Train a Doberman Pinscher1," A young Dobie will not need much more than a collar. As your dog ages, however, you will notice its strength increase. For most females dogs this is not a problem, but for the deeper-chested males you may need to purchase a head collar. A head collar is best because it establishes dominance. While using the head collar, you walk right next to your dog's head. The head collar is much like a horse halter. Instead of constantly pulling the collar and being dragged the Gentle Leader, a great brand of head collar, only needs a quick, sharp pull to control the dog.


Most dogs take a while to get used to the head collar, but if you are doing it right it will not hurt them. Make sure you follow all the instructions given to you when you purchase the head collar. Gentle leaders are available at your local pet store.
Pinch collars are also effective, but establish a bond based on fear. These should be used as a last resort. Solid training will eliminate any need for a pinch collar.;
, Give your dog a reward when it does something correctly instead of punishing them when they do something wrong.Reward-based training helps your dog create a positive link between the desirable action and getting a reward. The dog then learns what actions go with what cues and carries out the actions in order to earn a reward. This is a humane and highly effective training method.


Dobies have a strong food drive but overfeeding can lead to health and behavior problems. Try toys instead, because food aggression is common with Dobies.
When your dog does misbehave, because all dogs misbehave sometimes, try to get to the bottom of the behavior. If you know why the dog is doing bad things, you can possibly alleviate the problem, and thus the bad behavior.If all else fails, get rid of temptation for the dog. Move items it destroys or eats out of its space, so that you are not setting the dog up to fail.

, Many people take that instruction as an excuse to be mean to their dog. Firm handling just means that the Doberman is a fairly dominant dog, and needs to be taught right from wrong at an early age. Teach your Doberman that you are its leader when it is a puppy, because being bossed around by a large dog isn't fun.


Dogs can detect and reflect the emotions around them. So if your dog is behaving well, don't go overboard on the reward, because your dog can sense your happiness. When you dog is not behaving well, don't punish your Dobie horribly. It knows you're unhappy.
Don't be scarce on discipline. Dobies should respond well to a firm ""no"". The scold should be directed at him/her, so at the dog and point at them. Dobermans don't respond well to physical punishments, and hitting or physically punishing your dog is animal abuse.Do not deliberately stare a dog in the eye, especially if they may be aggressive. This is considered hostile, and you may inadvertently be challenging the dog to a fight.

, Tell your dog what you want it to do and never give it any mixed signals. This can be harder than you would think, so pay attention to your actions as much as your dogs.

Understand the breed characteristics.,
Teach your coonhound to walk on a leash.,
Strengthen the come command.,
Train in appropriate conditions.,
Know when your puppy is ready to hunt.",How to Train a Coon Dog1," Coonhounds refer to a group of dogs that were all bred to hunt and tree raccoons. There are a number of different types of coonhounds, including redbone, black and tan, American English, blue-tick, treeing walker, red-tick, and the plot hound, that range in weight and size. Because they were bred to hunt, coonhounds have a strong prey drive and are eager to please their owners by working.Coonhounds are the breed of choice for many small game hunters, especially in North America. They respond well to training and bred to be excellent hunters. They are hard workers and need daily exercise to satisfy their energy levels.Coonhounds hunt by scent and are expert trackers. They tend to hunt almost entirely relying on scent before they tree or corner the animal.;
, Coonhounds are notorious for following scents and ignoring the calls of the owners when they’re on the trail. Unless your dog is well trained, you should not let them off-leash in unsecured areas, like the open woods.Leash training can be more difficult with coonhounds than with other dogs, this will be an ongoing process.Attach a leash to your dog’s collar and let them become acclimated to being on a leash. Begin walking with your dog and reward them with a small treat when they stay by your side. If they attempt to pull on the leash, stop walking and do not move until the dog returns to you. This way, they learn that the walk will only continue when they behave on the leash., The come command is one of the more difficult commands for coonhounds to learn. As scent hounds, these dogs are bred to smell and are known to wander off and ignore commands whenever they pick up a scent.It is absolutely essential that your coonhound respond to the come command and return to you when they are called. When they do not know this command, you risk losing your dog to whatever scent they pick up, even if it leads them into dangerous areas.


Practice the come command by calling your dog’s name once and then rewarding their good behavior with a small treat when they come. Avoid yelling their name out over and over again when they don’t respond; this teaches them that it’s alright to ignore your call.

, Coonhound training should start when the puppy is about 12 weeks old and have received their shots. Ideally, training should take place either early in the morning or after it has rained. The wet ground helps the coonhound to follow a scent more effectively, and it gets the dog used to walking in water and through puddles.It is recommended that you train your dog just prior to meal times, when they are hungry, rather than after meals., Coon hound puppies are ready to hunt when you are certain that they will follow your obedience commands. Any puppy that struggles to come when called or heel, even 10% of the time, is not ready to hunt. You can start acclimating them to scents while they are still in obedience training, but they should never be allowed to track off leash, track a live animal, or go on a hunt.

Take the pup to places you commonly visit.,
Socialize your puppy with other species.,
Let your puppy interact with adult dogs.",How to Socialize a Puppy from a One Pup Litter2," Since you’ll most likely take your dog outside with you once it’s grown and has becomes an adult, you should familiarize your pup with the outside world from an early age. Take the puppy to the vet, to various parks, to your office workplace (if permitted). Walk the pup along roads so it can see and hear traffic.A puppy that’s cooped up inside and never experiences the sounds, smells, and sights of the outside world will grow into a fearful, shy dog and make an unpleasant pet.

, Pups will likely be most comfortable with other puppies and dogs, but it’s also important to allow them to meet other species of animal. This is especially important if you own another pet, like a cat, bird, or hamster. Allowing your pup to spend time with other species will familiarize the pup with these animals and help it prevent it from barking or chasing other species when it sees them first the first time as an adult.If there is a pet store in your vicinity, take you pup to visit. Let it walk through the store and smell the animals in their cages.
Ask your friends if they have other pets, and if so, bring your puppy to their house. Allow the animals to sniff each other and, if both animals seem comfortable, allow them to play together as well.

, In addition to socializing your pup with other puppies, you should let it meet adult dogs. Since older dogs may be hostile towards puppies, introduce the animals with both on a leash at first, or put the puppy in a crate for the older dog to smell. Once the puppy and dog have sniffed one another, and if there are no signs of fear or hostility, you can let the dogs off their leash. Let the two dogs play together, but keep an eye on your pup in case the older dog plays more aggressively than the puppy can handle.If you see a dog owned by a stranger—for example, at the dog park—confirm with the owner that the dog is friendly and will not attack your pup. If your puppy runs up to an older dog that happens to be aggressive, the dog may attack and harm your pup.

Expose your puppy to about five new people a day.,
Invite friends and family over often.,
Socialize your pup with a variety of types of people and clothing.",How to Socialize a Puppy from a One Pup Litter3," It’s important for your pup to interact with people other than you—otherwise, once the dog has matured, it may be openly hostile and mistrustful towards other individuals. Aim to introduce your pup to five new people a day.Taking your pup to a dog park (or a regular park) is a great way to socialize it. Be careful when leaving it on the ground around large dogs, however, as they may not be used to puppies and may play too aggressively.

, The people your dog meets don’t need to all be strangers; invite friends and family members over and ask them to pet, cuddle, and hold your puppy (which they’ll probably want to do anyway). As these people come to your house more often, the pup will soon get used to seeing them and will feel comfortable around them.Don’t overwhelm your puppy with all of the socialization. If it seems tired, or doesn’t want to be picked up and coddled anymore, ask friends to leave the dog along and enclose it in a separate room. This time alone is important for your puppy as well; it will help prevent the dog from developing separation anxiety later in its life., If you only introduce your puppy to people who look, act, and dress like you, the dog will likely be confused or aggressive when meeting people who act or dress differently. Ask your visiting friends to wear large, floppy hats, sweatshirts with hoods, sunglasses, snowboots and other types of clothing your dog is likely to see in the world.Introduce your puppy to people of different ethnicities than yourself, too. For example, if you only socialize your pup with Caucasian friends, your dog may bark or react with fear when seeing a person of color.

Teach a Doberman to respond to its name.,
House train a Doberman Pinscher.,
Socialize a Doberman Pincher as early as possible.,
Socialize adult dogs that are fearful of strangers.",How to Train a Doberman Pinscher2," This is an important first step for further training. Begin calling your dog by its name as soon as you adopt it. Even though the dog won't understand that you are talking about it right away, the repetition over time will help it to learn that you are talking about it.


Pick a name for your dog that is easy to say. This will allow you to teach the dog its name more easily.

, This is an important bit of training that is key to having a happy and healthy relationship with your pet. House training a dog is a bit different than teaching commands. Dogs instinctually want to keep their bathroom spot separate from where they sleep and eat. Because of this, house training a dog is more about showing the dog the boundaries of home and bathroom than directing the dog when to go to the bathroom.


The key to house training is taking your dog out on a regular basis. When you first begin training your dog, there will probably be accidents between trips outside, as the dog is not used to the routine yet. However, over time the dog's system will adjust to the regular intervals between trips outside.
If a dog goes to the bathroom in the house, immediately take it outside to finish its business. The important part of this is taking the dog outside immediately. A dog doesn't have the ability to make a connection between going to the bathroom inside and being taken outside unless these things happen basically simultaneously.

, Dobermans, like all dogs, need to be socialized at a young age.This means that you must take your puppy to parks, dog-friendly stores, and other places your pup will meet new people. You want your puppy to constantly be meeting new people, so that it understands that this is a normal, and pleasant, part of life.


If your puppy goes with little socialization, he or she will not be friendly to other dogs in the future. This will prove to be a major problem.

, If you adopt an adult dog that has not been socialized you should begin remedial socialization with them. This means that you need to start with the basics to get them used to people and animals out in the world.Start by building trust with the animal. It needs to trust and follow your commands in order to be trained how to respond to strangers and other animals.
Once you have bonded with your adult dog, then start doing short excursions into public. You should keep your dog away from actual contact with strangers and animals at first, simply letting the dog see that others out in the world mean it no harm.
Gradually introduce the dog to new people. Get a friend to help with this training. Have the person stand near the dog in a non-threatening position, but not so close that the dog could actually make contact.Have your helper use a kind voice and hold treats for the dog, so that it gradually goes to the helper on its own.
Also introduce your dog to other dogs. This is a delicate and gradual process, in which the dog first needs to see and smell the other dog before being allowed to get close enough to make contact with the other dog. This may take quite awhile if your dog is aggressive to other dogs. Over days, and probably weeks, gradually expose your dog to the sights and smells of other dogs.

Training a Doberman to sit.,
Training a Doberman to come when called.,
Teach a Doberman to heel.",How to Train a Doberman Pinscher3," Get your dog into a standing position and position yourself in its line of sight. Focus the dog's attention on a treat in your hand. Raise that hand in front of the dog’s nose to let it get the scent, then to above its head level. When you hold the treat above the dog’s head, most dogs will naturally sit to get a better view of it.


Give the dog an immediate treat and praise. Follow the routine of treat and praise and say “good sit” when the dog is performing the behavior. Your pup may be slow at first, but more treats and praise will speed up its response.
Make sure that you do not praise the dog until its actually sitting. If you praise halfway through the sit, the dog will think that is what you want. Also, make sure that you do not praise it for getting back up, or you will get that behavior instead of the sit.
If your dog does not sit with the treat technique, you can use your leash and collar. Stand next to the dog, facing the same direction as it. Place a little backward pressure on the collar to encourage a sit. You may even need to encourage the sit by adding a little gentle scoop behind the dog’s hind legs. Gently lean the dog backward with the help of the collar while doing this. As soon as it sits, give the dog immediate praise and reward.
Praise natural sitting behavior. Look for times throughout the day when your dog just sits on his own. Praise that behavior, and pretty soon you'll have a dog that sits for attention instead of jumping or barking at you.

, The “come” is used whenever you want your dog to come to you. This command is potentially life-saving, as it can prevent your dog from running off if he gets loose. Begin by getting your dog’s attention. You want to make it run toward you. Use praise and your “happy voice” to encourage the dog to move toward you. Once the dog comes, give immediate praise.Pair the behavior with the verbal command. As your dog begins to realize it will be rewarded for coming to you, start giving the verbal command “come.” When it responds to the command, reinforce it in praise by pairing it with “good”: “good come!”
Move the training to more public spaces. Because the “come” command could save your dog's life, it must learn to respond to it even when it's distracted. Move the training sessions from your home or yard to a public park. There are more sights, sounds, and smells demanding his attention there.
Give enormous rewards. Because this command is so important, the praise you give for performing it should be extravagant. Responding to the ""come"" command should be the best part of your dog's day.

, Take your dog on regular walks with a leash. This is important not just for training, but for its physical and mental health. Depending on what breed of dog you have, the dog may need a lot of exercise to keep it happy and in shape.


Discourage pulling. Most dogs will pull on the leash when they're learning to take walks. When it starts pulling, stop immediately. Don't take another step until the dog comes to your side and focuses its attention on you.
Change directions. An even more effective method is to walk in the opposite direction and encourage your dog to come with you. Once it has caught up, praise and treat it.
Make it fun to be by your side. Your dog's natural impulse is to chart its own course and investigate its environment. You need to make walking by your side more appealing that that. Use an enthusiastic voice when changing directions, and lavish the dog with praise when it comes back to your side.
Pair the behavior with a verbal command. Once the dog walks consistently at your side, you can give the behavior a name, like “heel"" or “let’s go.”

Use a scent drag.,
Acclimate the dog to the scent.,
Drag the scent across your property.,
Command your dog to follow the scent.,
Tie the carcass or scent drag to a tree.,
Repeat this process, varying the route.,
Reward your puppy after tracking.",How to Train a Coon Dog2," Scent is the sense that coonhounds rely on the most during the hunt so you want to begin to acclimate a puppy to following a scent early on. You can purchase raccoon scent from an outdoor or sporting retailer, or online. Apply the scent to a drag, whether it is an old rag or a retrieving dummy.You can also use a fresh raccoon carcass, but be aware that scent training is an ongoing process and you’ll need to procure new carcasses to train with as the old ones begin to deteriorate.

, Let the puppy play with the scented dummy so they become acclimated to the smell. Reward the puppy with a small treat for showing interest, but take the drag away before they lose interest in it. This is called “putting them away hot” and helps you to control your puppy’s interest in the scent.Repeat this process for at least three days, continuing to put the drag away while it’s hot.

, Attach the scented dummy or coon hide to a line or rope. Pull the line across your property, creating a scent trail. Do this while your dog is inside and cannot see you pulling the line. The trail will ultimately end at a tree, where you'll hang the scent drag or carcass.


This creates a scent trail for your coonhound to practice following.

, After you’ve finished creating a scent line, put the drag away and out of sight. Bring the dog out of the house and lead them to the area where you began dragging the line. They should be on a leash, since coonhounds are prone to running after scents. Encourage them to find the scent and pair it with a verbal cue, like “find it” or “find the scent, Max.”


The dog will hopefully catch on to the command and begin tracking the scent. If your dog does not seem to understand, you can lead them around the area where you pulled the drag and let them sniff the ground along the way. Their scent instincts will eventually take over. Give them a treat when they are done following the scent and respond to your come command.
Practice this scent lead process for every other day for at least two weeks.

, This way, your puppy will begin to associate the smell of the raccoon with trees. This helps to link the two in their mind, so when it comes to tracking a real raccoon they know that the trail will ultimately end with them treeing the animal. Each scent trail should end at a tree.

, The coonhound is now beginning to associate the scent of the raccoon with the hunt, and with the tree. Repeat this process of dragging a scent throughout your property several times each week. Vary the route each time, but always end at a tree where you’ve hung the drag or the hide.


This process should be repeated at least 2-3 times each week. The first two years of your dog’s life are integral to training them to a good scent hound, and this is the best way to strengthen their skills., Every time your puppy successfully tracks the scent to the tree, praise them and offer them a treat. This helps them to associate the hunt with positive things, though they will likely find it inherently enjoyable.

Trap a live raccoon.,
Release the raccoon into an open area.,
Release your dog after the raccoon is out of sight.,
Follow your puppy as they track.",How to Train a Coon Dog3," If you have the means, trap a live raccoon. While it is in a cage, allow your puppy to investigate it. This should be done after they have successfully tracked a scent from the drag trail. This way, the scent is still fresh and they can associate the scent that they recognize with a live animal.


Allow the puppy to sniff around the cage. They will likely begin to bark, which you should encourage. The loud and booming bark of a coonhound is what will alert you that they are on the trail of a raccoon in the woods so you can shoot it.

, This should only be done if you have fully trained your dog to respond to the come command and you have no doubts that your dog will respond to your calls. This should not be attempted with a dog that is not fully trained in basic obedience. You can release the raccoon from the trap into open area.

, Once the raccoon is out of sight, release your dog from their leash and allow them to chase after the raccoon. They will likely bark loudly and enthusiastically follow the scent of the raccoon into a wooded area.

, Your coonhound will follow the scent and tree the raccoon. If they are unable to find the raccoon, you will need to stop them from searching from the scent and revisit scent training.

Secure your dog.,
Fire your gun safely at a target.,
Look at the dog’s reaction to the loud noise.,
Repeat this exercise.",How to Train a Coon Dog4," Desensitizing your dog to gunfire should take place in a secure area. Do not shoot a gun in an area that is populated with other people, and only use a firearm that you are legally registered to use. Your dog should be secured in a crate.

, You should be within a dozen feet of your dog’s crate while you are shooting. Never shoot your gun into the air, always aim at a target.

, If they seems frightened, stand farther away from the crate and repeat the exercise. Say calm and encouraging words and reward them with a treat when the exercise is over.


The alternative to this process is to have someone else fire a gun at a distance while you give your puppy a treat or toy at the same time the shot is fired. During this process, they will associate the loud noise with something they like and will be less likely to be frightened by it.

, Over several days, repeat this process until your puppy is no longer startled by the noise. This may take a few weeks if your puppy continues to be startled by the noise. Some dogs are more skittish and bothered by gunfire than others. This process may take repetition over the following days, or weeks.

Get a clicker.,
Keep treats on hand.,
Use toys and play time as a reward.,
Train in different locations and positions.",How to Train a Miniature Pinscher1," It is important to mark your dog’s good behavior right when she does it. Using a clicker can help you to do this. A clicker is a small noisemaker that you can buy in a pet supply store. Use a clicker to mark your dog’s good behavior and help her to learn what you want her to do.For example, if your dog responds to your “Sit” command by sitting, then click the clicker right as her bottom hits the floor. This will help her to associate sitting with doing something good.;
, Treats are excellent for motivating your mini pin to obey your commands. Keep a bag of your mini pin’s favorite treats on hand and reward her with one for following your commands.


Never hold treats in your hand while you are training. This will distract your dog and she will not be able to give you her full attention.Try to vary how often you give your mini pin a treat. Giving a treat after every command can leave your mini pin expecting to be rewarded. Give frequent treats at first and then start to space them out more, such as every other command or every third or fourth command.

, You can also use other things to reward your mini pin for her hard work and obedience during training sessions. For example, you can give your mini pin a new toy, reward her with a belly rub, or take her for a walk., If you always train your mini pin while you are sitting down, then she may associate the command with your body position. Likewise, if you only train your mini pin in the living room, then she may associate the command with the room.Make sure that you vary your training positions and locations to ensure that your mini pin will respond to your commands in any situation.

Start house breaking immediately.,
Proceed with crate training.,
Take your Bichon Frise out every two to three hours.,
Try paper training if your Bichon is particularly stubborn about housebreaking.,
Teach your Bichon Frise not to bite.,
Practice good leash manners.,
Be aware of small dog syndrome.,
Start with ""sit"" and ""lie down."",
Teach your Bichon to come.,
Move on to other basic commands.,
Look into more elaborate training opportunities.",How to Train a Bichon Frise," House breaking starts as soon as you get home, by putting the dog on their toilet spot and praising them when they go. This is the first step toward training your bichon frise.;
, Bichon Frises are quick learners in most aspects, but can be notoriously difficult to potty train.


Many owners are wary of crate training as they don't want to confine their pets. However, dogs are den animals and do not mind being occasionally confined to a crate. Periodically crating a dog, for road trips or overnight vet visits, is inevitable. It's good idea to get your pet used to a crate regardless of potty training.Try to make entering the crate a treat rather than a punishment. Keep it comfortable, with bedding and toys, and offer your Bichon a small treat before he enters his crate. However, make sure any toy you put in the crate is big enough your dog cannot swallow it. This is especially important if you have a puppy who may not know better.If you have a puppy, he might occasionally have an accident in his crate overnight. Most puppies should be able to sleep soundly in their crate without urinating or defecating after three months. If your Bichon is still having bathroom problems after three months, talk to a vet to rule out underlying medical issues.You'll have to keep your Bichon in the crate any time he is not supervised. When you go to bed, go out, or are busy with household chores, your Bichon will need to be in his crate. Play with him for 10 to 15 minutes before putting him in the crate so he's relaxed and does not have pent up energy.However, it is important not to treat the crate as a ""cage"" or ""prison"" and to keep use to a minimum. If necessary, when you are home keep the dog on a lead so you can keep an eye on him and take him outside to toilet as soon as you spot signs of him wanting to toilet.

, If you have a puppy, take it out even more frequently (every 20 - 30 minutes). You need to get your Bichon on a bathroom schedule and teach him outside is the proper place to do his business. When you're first housebreaking your Bichon, let him out every two to three hours.


Ideally, you should let your Bichon out 10 to 15 minutes after he eats. This is when he's most likely to need to use the bathroom. Praise him when he goes outside and otherwise encourage the behavior. This can be done by allowing the Bichon to walk around, as movement stimulates bowel movements. You can also take him to a spot in the yard you've seen other dogs use as a bathroom. He will recognize the scent and is more likely to go there.Then when he toilets make a big fuss, tell him he's a clever boy and offer a treat.
Keep a diary for the first couple of weeks. Take notes of when and where your Bichon went outside and any accidents that occur. Write down times. You want to get a sense of your Bichon's bathroom schedule. Planning walks and outings when you know he's more likely to go can help teach him to associate the outdoors with using the bathroom.Until your Bichon is accident free in the house, you will have to continue crating him while you're gone, sleeping, or busy., Bichons, and small dogs in general, can be difficult to house train. If you keep having problems with him going inside, despite following proper training protocol, you might want to consider paper training your Bichon.


Paper training means teaching your Bichon he can go inside but only if he uses newspaper, pads sold for paper training purposes, or other absorbent material you can leave around the house.You should only use positive reinforcement to paper train your Bichon. Praise him when he uses the proper materials indoors and correct him when he does not. Scolding should be done in a deep, authoritarian voice. Never get hysterical and resort to yelling. This only frightens and confuses a dog.If you have a male, paper training is not advised. Males tend to have more trouble differentiating between appropriate and inappropriate places to urinate than females and are more likely to struggle with paper training., Biting can be a problem with Bichons. They are a friendly breed, so the biting is usually a non-aggressive form of play. However, the dog might not realize biting can be painful to humans. It's important that you train this behavior out of your dog, especially if you have young children.


Teach your kids to use the ""Be a Tree"" approach. This means standing still, with limbs held at your side, and avoiding eye contact with the dog. Bichons bite for a variety of reasons, whether it's to assert authority or an attempt to play. If the behavior is not getting a response, they will grow bored and stop.If you have young children, especially toddlers, supervise their interaction with your Bichon. In particular, do not let your child interrupt a Bichon while he is eating, playing with his toys, or drinking water. If the dog becomes territorial, he might bite. If his resources are frequently threatened he might learn to habitually engage in biting. Until your child is old enough to respect a dog's boundaries, supervise any interactions.Positive and negative reinforcement are a great means of training a Bichon not to bite. When a Bichon is out of his crate, supervise him at all times. If you notice biting, correct the behavior immediately with a stern ""No.""
Redirecting a Bichon's biting tendencies is also an effective means of curbing biting. When a Bichon nibbles on hands or fingers, immediately place a toy or a bone in his mouth instead. This teaches him biting is okay, as long as it's done to his toys and snacks and not his people.Biting should never be encouraged, even in play. A Bichon is not a dog you should wrestle or otherwise rough house with as this leads to timid and even aggressive behaviors., Bichons can be excellent walking companions, but like all dogs they do need basic leash training.


Make sure your Bichon is familiar and comfortable in his collar, especially if he's a puppy. A lightweight leather collar is ideal for a Bichon. It might take him a bit for him to get used to wearing the collar, so take it off when he's unsupervised until he's used to it.Introduce your Bichon to the leash slowly. Allow him to sniff it and familiarize himself with it before attaching it to the collar. Once he's familiar, you can begin walking him.Start small. Just walk the Bichon around the house. Praise him if he walks by your side on a loose leash. If he pulls, do not pull the leash back. Not only can this strain a Bichon's neck, it reinforces the behavior by giving the dog attention for acting out. You need to show your Bichon that pulling on the leash will result in him getting nowhere. Simply stop walking and call your Bichon back to you.Once your Bichon is well behaved inside, you can start taking him for short walks around the neighbor. A 15 to 20 minute walk a few times a day is ideal and will give your Bichon enough time to adapt to walking on a leash., Small dog syndrome can be a problem with smaller breeds like Bichon Frises. Owners do not discipline their dogs for behaviors like barking and biting and attempt to protect small dogs from the world. What results is improper socialization that leads to a number of behavioral problem.Make sure your Bichon feels happy, safe, and confident when near larger dogs. People often pick up small dogs in the presence of bigger dogs, or yell loudly when they're approached by big dogs. Both behaviors teach Bichons big dogs should be feared, which can lead to biting, yipping, and other territorial behaviors.If your Bichon seems nervous around big dogs, talk to him calmly and give him treats and praise if he stays calm. Do not continue to praise him, however, once a big dog has passed. This will lead him to becoming spoiled and expecting extra attention in response to day-to-day circumstances.Remember, small dogs should be disciplined for the same behaviors as large dogs. People often let nipping, barking, and aggression go unchecked in small dogs because they believe they're less likely to cause physical harm. However, a small dog could easily lash out at a young child and their bites can be hard enough to require stitches. Do not let your Bichon's size determine how you treat him and never give him a pass for aggressive behaviors., Sit and lie down lay out the groundwork for nearly every command a dog can perform. To shake paws, a dog must be sitting. To roll over, a dog must lie down. When you begin teaching your Bichon Frise, start with ""sit"" and ""lie down"" as these are foundational commands.


Begin with sit. To teach sit, stand up, say sit, and then use a treat and draw an arc over the puppy' s head so that as his head goes up his bottom goes down.The instant your Bichon sits, praise him with treats and other rewards.Use hand motions once your dog understands they need to sit when you say sit. Put your hand forward and gesture for your dog to sit down. As they begin to master the command, you can phase out hand gestures. Try to repeat the command 10 or 15 times a day until your Bichon learns to sit without hand gestures of constant reinforcement in the form of treats or praise. Ideally, you should be able to get your Bichon to sit when he's being disruptive with guests or before you take him for a walk.
You can smoothly transition from sit to lie down by commanding your Bichon to sit. Then, while saying ""lie down,"" use a treat to lure him into a lying position. Get him to sit then hold the treat at floor level but slowly move it away from him so that he stretches and lies down to get it. Praise him with treats and attention as soon as he's lying down. Much like you taught sit, practice until you can gradually phase out rewards and hand gestures.

, Come is an important command every dog should learn quickly. Knowing to come when called can prevent accidents and can allow your dog to have greater freedom in certain situations.


Your goal in teaching ""come"" is to get your dog to go to you upon hearing the command, regardless of what else is going on. This can be difficult, but with dedication and patience it's achievable.Always praise your dog when they return to you upon hearing the command. Never punish them, even if you were calling them back because they were misbehaving. You don't want your dog to associate coming to you with any negative consequences.You can teach come by giving your dog positive reinforcement every time he obeys. Provide him treats, praise, or access to a toy or bed he likes. Come should be a positive sound for your dog, something he looks forward to hearing. Practice several sets of ""come here,"" making your dog perform the command 15 to 20 times. Three to four sets a day should eventually solidify the behavior in your dog.Never let your Bichon off his leash in public until he has mastered the ""come"" command., Bichons are a highly trainable breed. Once you've mastered behaviors like sit, lie down, and come, you can move on to other basic commands.


It's sometimes easy to watch for behaviors you can observe and reinforce with a command. Watch for the desired behaviors and then praise them. For example, if you want to teach your Bichon to ""speak"" say ""speak"" when he barks, and praise him. Make sure, however, this is not in response to disruptive barking, such as barking at other dogs or people.Consequences need to be immediate as dogs live in the present. If you want your Bichon to beg on cue, and you see him on his hind legs, say ""beg"" and immediately reward him with food or praise.The best way to teach certain behaviors is by simply watching for them, but other behaviors can be maneuvered the way you taught ""sit"" and ""lie down."" For example, if you want your Bichon to shake you can physically move his paw towards you while saying ""shake"" or ""give me a paw."" Reward him as soon as his paw hits your hand. Eventually, he should pick up on the fact he needs to lift his hand when you say ""shake.""Once the dog has learned what verbal cues signify what behaviors, practice the desired behavior 15 to 20 minutes a day. This will solidify the connection and get your dog to perform on cue when needed.Many owners believe they have to behave like an alpha dog. While your Bichon should understand you're in charge, never engage in disciplinary behaviors like rolling a dog on his side, pinching his neck, or other physical forms of punishments. Dogs do not actually respond to this and it can foster feelings of fear. A better way to assert authority is by making your dog understand his schedule is on your terms. Make him sit before putting on his leash for a walk. Make him lie down before you place food in his bowl., Bichons are highly trainable, and can easily get beyond the basics. If you're interested in dog training, there are a variety of paths to teach your dog more elaborate skills.


Consider enrolling in an advanced training class once your dog knows the basics of sit, lie down, and come here. A professional trainer can help you teach your dog more elaborate tricks and, as an added bonus, training is a great way to socialize your Bichon. He'll learn how to behave appropriately in the presence of multiple different types of dogs.
Bichons skill sets are not limited to party tricks. Many owners enjoy professional agility training with their Bichons. Look into agility courses in your area. You can compete at shows, sometimes for cash prizes, and it's a great hobby that fosters a healthy, happy relationship between you and your dog.Bichons are also excellent therapy and/or hospital dogs. If you're interested in getting your Bichon certified for hospital or therapy work, look into programs available in your area. Bichons have a naturally friendly personality and love people. Having your dog interact with sick people, or help those with mental or physical disabilities, can be an extremely rewarding endeavor."

Be affectionate to your dog.",How to Take Care of a Lhasa Apso," Lhasa apsos, like other dogs, usually eat 1-2 times a day, depending on how you want to space out their meals. Choose a dog food that is low in grains and high in protein, as a dog is naturally carnivorous.Follow the suggestions on the food packaging when determining how much food to feed your Lhasa. This suggestion is usually based on the dog's weight and how old they are.
Consult with your veterinarian if you have questions about your dog's diet. They should have good suggestions about appropriate amounts to feed your dog and what brands might fit your dog's particular dietary needs best.;
, It can be hard to resist a cute Lhasa face when it is begging for a little treat. However, for the health of the dog, resist giving it too many calories.


If you do want to give your dog treats, reserve the treats for training sessions. That way your dog will get the satisfaction of a treat and a new skill at the same time.

, Dehydration can occur quickly and it is inhumane to put a dog through that due to negligence.

, Try using a double sided brush, one with separated pins on one side and the other with nice smooth bristles. This will give you several options for different areas of the coat. Also, remember to brush with the direction of hair growth, so that you don't tangle the coat further.


Remember to brush your Lhasa at least weekly or its coat can get terribly tangled.

, Lhasa apsos are naturally long haired, but can have short hair, often called a ""puppy cut.""Either way, they will need to get a cut on a regular basis, unlike short-haired dogs whose fur falls out. Decide which cut you like best and take your Lhasa to a groomer to get the cut.


If you like a challenge, you can groom your dog yourself. However, this takes quite a bit of skill so you may want to do some research and have some practice before you decide to do a full grooming yourself.
A ""puppy cut"" is easier to care for and cooler for the dog. Consider getting your dog a ""puppy cut"" if you are having a hard time keeping up with brushing or your dog is getting overheated.

, These things do not need to be done as often as brushing your dog's coat, but they should be done on a regular basis.Taking the time to assess your dog's feet and ears is a good way to bond with the dog and keep track of its general physical health.


Trim your Lhasa's nails down but do not cut the quick of the nail, where the nail is alive, or this will be painful for the dog and it may bleed.
Begin cleaning your dog's ears by looking in them for dirt and debris. If you see it, clean it out with a dry, soft cloth. Also look for infections or mites, which should be treated by a veterinarian.

, Like other dogs, a Lhasa apso's teeth should be brushed with dog toothpaste on a regular basis to avoid tooth decay. In fact, brushing your dog's teeth can be a good training exercise and it will help freshen its breath as well.To get your dog used to a tooth brushing, you need to introduce the process gradually. Start with some dog toothpaste and let the dog lick it off your finger. Then, the next day, try sticking the toothpaste on your finger in its mouth. Gradually work up to the toothpaste on a doggie toothbrush and putting it onto the dog's teeth.
It can take some time to get a dog acclimated to tooth brushing. So, don't worry if your dog has a hard time with it. Just keep trying.
Do not use toothpaste made for humans. It can be toxic for dogs. Instead, you should get toothpaste for dogs, which is available online or at your local pet store.

, Lhasa apsos can be suspicious of strangers, so it's good to get them used to a variety of people and places early in life. This includes other dogs. Socializing a Lhasa apso well can minimize that instinct.Lhasa apsos that are not socialized very well can get very jealous with other dogs. Keep your dog away from other dogs until you are sure that it can interact with other dogs without getting aggressive.

, All dogs should be trained to sit, stay, come, lay down, and heel. A well trained dog is a joy to have in your home and your bond with the dog will be stronger if you have a clear understanding about the expectations you have for your dog.


This training can take some time but it is worth the effort.

, This is an important training process so that the dog knows where and when to go to the bathroom and so that it does not have accidents in the house. Potty training can take some time, especially with a stubborn dog like a Lhasa apso, so take your time and try to be patient.With enough work and consistency, your dog will get the hang of it.


Some pet owners use ""pee pads"" so that a dog can go to the bathroom inside. If you want to do this, you will still need to train the dog to go on the pad and not other places in your home.

, Some Lhasa's are stubborn and difficult to train. However, if you are consistent and unwilling to give up, your dog will be more likely to learn to follow your commands.


Lhasas often are not motivated to listen to humans or follow their directions. Because of this, make sure you have a small treat to use for training, as this will make the dog more likely to pay attention to you.

, This is very important in order to keep your Lhasa in tip top shape. Your veterinarian will make sure that the dog is up to date on its vaccinations and that its general health is fine.


Lhasa apsos do not really suffer from many hereditary diseases, however they can have problems with their kidneys.Have your Lhasa screened for renal dysplasia so that you can start treatment before an issue becomes serious.

, Even though a Lhasa apso does not require as much exercise as a working dog, for instance, that does not mean that it doesn't require any exercise. Walk and play with him or her often. In fact, Lhasa apsos enjoy daily walks and regular play times.Make sure your dog is on a leash for walks. Lhasas can be very interested in strangers and new areas, so if off leash it may wonder off.

, As a dog, the thing it needs most is love. This love can be shown by playing with your dog, going to the dog park, playing inside, or just snuggling on the couch. However you like to spend time with your dog, do it.


Just be sure to give it enough attention so that it doesn't get depressed due to loneliness.
However, Lhasa apso are usually ok if you leave them at home while you go to work. They do not usually get separation anxiety like some other breeds do."

Take your mini pin outside often.,
Watch for bathroom behaviors.,
Use positive reinforcement, not negative reinforcement.,
Enlist the help of a neighbor or friend during long periods away.",How to Train a Miniature Pinscher2," Potty training your mini pin takes time and effort on your part and hers. One important part of potty training is taking your mini pin outside to go potty often. You may need to take your mini pin out once every two hours until she is house trained.


Make sure that you take her to the same spot every time. Choose a patch of grass in the yard where you want your mini pin to go potty and lead her to the same spot every time.
Give her lots of praise when she goes potty outside. Rub her belly, say “Good dog!” and give her a treat when you get back in the house., Your mini pin will probably start showing some typical bathroom behaviors when she has to go potty, so be on the watch for these. Take her outside to go potty as soon as you notice bathroom behaviors. Some typical bathroom behaviors include:sniffing
walking in circles
walking with back legs straight and stiff

, Always remember to reward your mini pin for going potty outside. Do not use negative reinforcement because it does not help your dog to learn new behaviors. It only frightens your dog.Never yell at your dog, hit your dog, or rub your dog’s nose in urine or feces. If your mini pin goes potty in the house, simply take your dog outside and clean up the mess right away to prevent her from using the same spot again.
You can also clap your hands loudly if you notice her going in the house. This should startle her enough to get her to stop and then you can lead her outside to finish., If you will be at work or somewhere else for a long stretch of time, then it is important to find someone who can take your mini pin outside to go potty.


Try asking a friend or neighbor to stop by once or twice to let out your mini pin or walk her around the block. If you cannot find someone to let your mini pin during the day, then consider hiring a dog walker or taking your mini pin to doggy daycare while you are away.
Your dog cannot hold her urine or feces all day and it is cruel to expect your dog to do so. If you leave for a long stretch of time and your dog cannot go out, then she will likely have an accident.

Start with “Sit.” Sit is the most basic command that you can teach your dog and it is easy to teach, so it is a great place to start.,
Teach your mini pin to “Stay.” Teaching the “Stay” command is also important in early training.,
Use the “Come” command to get your mini pinscher to walk towards you.,
Get your mini pin to “Speak.” Teaching you mini pin to speak is a fun basic command.,
Add the “Quiet” command.",How to Train a Miniature Pinscher3," To teach your dog to sit, stand in front of her and say “Sit” while raising your hand in the air or holding a treat in the air to keep her attention.You may have to do this a few times before she gets the idea. If it does not work the first time, keep trying.
If your mini pin does not respond to the command and hand gesture alone, then you can also try gently pushing her bottom down towards the floor while saying “Sit.”

, To teach your mini pin to stay, wait until he is sitting down and then label the behavior as “Stay.” Reward your mini pin with praise and a treat for staying seated.


After doing this few times, try giving the command while slowly backing away from your mini pin. Reward her if she stays put. Over time, your mini pin will learn that “Stay” means don’t move.
You can also train this command while your mini pin is on a leash and just back away as far as the leash will allow., Training your mini pin to come towards you is another important basic command. To train this command, say “Come” and pat your legs with your hands. This should entice your mini pin to walk towards you. If she does, then reward the behavior.


After a few times of saying “Come” while patting your legs, you can progress to just giving the command. Say “Come” and see if your mini pin approaches you. If she does, reward her with a treat and lots of praise.
If your dog does not respond to you standing up and patting your legs, you can also try squatting down with your arms out to her.This might be a more comforting position for a puppy.

, You can teach this command by first doing something to get your mini pin to speak, such as knocking at the door. Then, while your mini pin is barking, label the behavior as “Speak” and reward her.Repeat this exercise a few times and then try to get your mini pin to speak without knocking at the door. Just say “Speak” and see if your mini pin barks. If she does, then reward her with some praise and treat.

, You can also train the “Quiet” command along with the “Speak” command. To train your mini pinscher to be quiet, wait until he stops barking on his own and then label the behavior by saying “Quiet.” Make sure to reward your mini pin for being quiet as well.After labeling the behavior a few times, try to command your mini pin to be quiet while he is barking. Reward your mini pin if she goes quiet in response to your command.

Observe your Belgian Malinois every day for basic health.,
Treat parasite infections.",How to Train a Belgian Malinois," After you take the puppy out from its nest, you have to immediately introduce it to paper training.  Have it smell all the areas in your house. Have ample fresh water for it to drink.  


Add to the training the crate.  It needs to know where its going to sleep every day.  Make the puppy understand that his place is the crate and not your couch or your room.  
Use only a leather collar leash instead of a choke collar.
Buy toys for the puppy and have it play after every training session.;
, This is trying to establish that you are the alpha instead of it.  

,  Keep a record notebook of the training sessions and the routines that you do each day.  

, For example, bring it to the marketplace, ride a bicycle and have the puppy tail beside you. Make it accustomed to different noises, like trumpets, toy guns, radio, vacuum cleaner and many more. After a month of paper training, introduce it outside the house and have it pee and poop there.


Do this every morning, noon and evening after dinner.  You need to do this routine every day, until it learns the trick.

, When you want to make the puppy sit, just push its rear down while you are holding the leash and at the same time saying the word sit. In this way, it will learn that you want it to sit.  


About 10 to 15 repetitions will do the trick.
 Of course, you need to reward it every time the dog does the right job, like giving it treats such as food or affection.  
Do this routine everyday for ten days until the puppy knows what it needs to do.  

,  First ask the dog to sit. Then push it down at the same time saying the word Down. Keep repeating this routine for a maximum of 30 minutes. Do it again in the afternoon.  


Keep in mind the positive reinforcement technique by saying ""Good boy/girl"" when it does the right thing.  
Always record your progress in your small notebook. Also record the places that have been introduced to the puppy.

, A well-groomed dog is a happy and healthy dog. You need to bathe your puppy every week. Use the proper shampoo for the dog, introduce anti-lice powder, and dry it properly with a dryer and dry sheets every time. Clean its paws too, as well as its mouth and ears.  


Use clean cotton balls wet with a little water and rubbing alcohol and rub it gently on its inner ears.  
Inspect the body the head and the front and hind legs.  Also inspect its eyes.  

, After bathing have it pee outside the house.  Walk it around for awhile until its body is sun dried.

,  When you arrive home from work just go inside the gate and into the house but don't caress it, to avoid the jumping actions. Instead, have the dog sit and pet it about three time and let it down.  This is enough. Or, if you brought home some treats, this is the right time to give the dog the treat when it is in the down position.

, As this dog is a work in progress, you need to teach your Belgian Malinois that it is not proper for it to stand in front you while you're eating your meal.  Instead, have it in the down position near the doorway while you and your family are having your meals. Don't give any food during this time.


Always have the dog in the down position facing the doorway. This will enforce discipline for your Belgian Malinois. When taught properly, every Belgian Malinois will eventually become the apple of its owners' eyes.

, Note how it is walking, the way the dog eats. If anything out of the ordinary shows up, or if there is a manifestation of sickness, go to the veterinarian immediately and have the dog checked. This avoids further complications later on.

, You need to have the dog deloused every month and dewormed every six months.  This is proper health management.  Lice infestation, especially in the ears, will develop into hematomas and will cost you a lot afterwards.  This could also destroy the erectness of its hears, once the hematomas develop, you won't see the erect ears anymore.

A few trademark characteristics include being physically energetic and mentally active. Miniature Schnauzers also don't like being left alone for long periods of time.You should also consider how much space, exercise, and attention a dog will need. Make sure you can meet his needs.;
, If you're looking for an adult Miniature Schnauzer, you may be able to find one at an animal shelter. You can also ask your vet about any breed specific rescue shelters in your area who might have Miniature Schnauzers in need of homes. If you want to get a puppy, contact a few breeders and ask about upcoming litters.If you're getting a puppy, remember that he'll only be a puppy for a few months, but he'll be a dog for up to 20 years.

, Check to see if the breeder socializes the puppies from an early age, which exposes them to a wide range of sights and sounds. It's also helpful if the breeder rears the pups within the house, so they're used to the hustle and bustle of a home.If the pups are reared in an outdoor kennel, ask about how much contact the pups have with everyday stimuli such as washing machines, vacuums, hairdryers, people and pets.

, On your visit, try not to be put off by the parents barking when you arrive. Miniature Schnauzers are vocal, good guard dogs, which makes them protective of their puppies. (You'll have to teach your Miniature Schnauzer how and when barking is OK.) Make sure you can see the puppies with their mothers. If you can't see her, don't consider buying from the breeder.No matter how good the excuse or reason that she isn't there, walk away. The mother not being available to view is a classic warning sign of a puppy mill pup.

, Personality may be one of the most important factors for you in choosing a dog. If you're getting one from a breeder, listen to the breeder's opinion and don't be blinded by the cuteness of a puppy. Breeders should also have temperament response tests and genetic screening information available. Other important factors to consider when selecting your Miniature Schnauzer include:


Coat: Choose from black, salt and pepper (varying shades of gray), black and silver, and white.
Sex: Male or female. Consider if there are many dogs of the same sex in your area (you would probably get the opposite so they can be friends, especially with two males).
Temperament: Look for a puppy that's not shy or overly brave, and is calm when around several other puppies from a different litter. If the puppy cowers in the corner when you first approach him, he may be afraid and lack confidence. If the puppy approaches you, this shows he's confident., If you have chosen a puppy, you will probably have to wait a few weeks until he is ready to go home at 8 or 9 weeks of age. The ideal time for taking a puppy home is between 10 and 12 weeks. This way, he can get his first round of immunizations. Also, a conscientious breeder will have socialized the puppy to being around new people, strange dogs, and started the dog well on his way to house and kennel training by then.


You have a reason to be cautious if breeders are offering you the puppy when it feels as it is too young.

, Ask your veterinarian to recommend an appropriate dog food and suggest a suitable daily quantity for your particular Miniature Schnauzer. You'll need to look for a packaged food that's labelled as meeting AAFCO or area appropriate health standards. In the meantime, keep using the diet that your dog has been following and make any changes gradually. If you have a new puppy, ask the breeder to give you 4 to 5 days worth of food that your puppy is used to. You can gradually mix in the food you want your puppy to have, so that your puppy has a smooth transition without stomach trouble.Miniature Schnauzers are genetically predisposed to high cholesterol, which means they are at risk of developing a painful condition called pancreatitis.
Episodes of pancreatitis are triggered by high fat foods, so avoid feeding your Miniature Schnauzers on high fat foods such as sausages, burgers or other rich meats. Some same pork is poisonous to this breed too., Since Miniature Schnauzers are known to love their food and gain weight easily, you'll need to make sure he gets plenty of exercise to stay healthy. Your puppy will need to eat 3 to 4 times a day and relieve himself after meals, walks, and every 2 to 3 hours until he goes to sleep tired at the end of the day. This will drop to 1 to 2 times daily and every 4 to 6 hours by the time he's 2 years old.


Once he's an adult, you'll need to make sure your Miniature Schnauzer is eating one or two times a day and getting at least two 30 minute walks a day., Start housetraining your puppy on his first day in your home by showing him the toilet spot and praising him when he uses it successfully. Don't be afraid to try simple ""Sit"" exercises with even a young puppy. Miniature Schnauzers can start learning basic commands as early as 10 weeks old. They're also very intelligent and should catch on quickly.


Don't push your dog to the point that he gets frustrated. Instead, try to have fun and mentally stimulate him while housetraining him., Your Miniature Schnauzer will adapt to a daily routine, but only as long as you meet his biological needs: to eat frequently, relieve himself after each meal, and get enough exercise every single day.For best behavior, walk this breed of dog twice a day for 30 minutes each, adjusting the walks to end before he's exhausted. You should also mentally stimulate him by playing games and incorporating training sessions into the routine. Don't forget to reward your dog with treats.


A simple routine might include a morning walk, taking him home, and playing by teaching him to respond to both hand gestures and voice commands.

, Your Mini Schnauzer should go to the vet for his full set of vaccinations to protect against infections diseases. Your vet will know what diseases are common in your area and what your dog should be vaccinated against.You may also talk with your vet about implanting an ID microchip under your dog's skin. This is a permanent form of identification that proves you own your dog and makes tracking your dog easier if he's lost.

, If you don't plan on breeding from your dog, talk with your veterinarian about the benefits of desexing him. Neutering males eliminates the risk of testicular cancer and can prevent aggressive or antisocial behavior. If done before the second season, desexing can protect female dogs against breast cancer and eliminates the possibility of womb infections later in life.Since desexing your dog prevents unwanted puppies, you won't need to care for them, find homes for them, or contribute to the large number of abandoned dogs.

Will you be able to meet dogs you will be able to adopt? How will they match you up with the correct dogs? If you are comfortable with the rescue, then proceed to the next step.

,, Remember to be as honest and truthful as possible. The rescue needs to know as much as they can about you so they can match you up with the perfect dog!

Begin training as soon as possible.,
Take your puppy outside every half hour.,
Crate your Basset when they are unsupervised.",How to Raise a Basset Hound1," As soon as you bring your puppy home, you should begin training them. Establish a pattern from the beginning by bringing your outside to see if they need to go potty.Unless you are feeding, training, or playing with your Basset, use a baby gate to confine your puppy to a small section of the house, like the laundry room, for the first few days. This will enable you to supervise and monitor your puppy to see when your puppy needs to use the restroom.
Signs that a puppy needs to potty are sniffing the floor, circling while sniffing the floor, and/or whining.;
, Because puppies do not have full control of their bladders yet, taking your puppy outside frequently to use the restroom is very important. Taking them outside every half hour to go potty when they are 8 to 12 weeks old will begin to establish the boundaries for urinating and defecating. Once your puppy has gone potty outside, reward the correct behavior with praise and treats.Also, take your puppy outside after naps, meals, and after play time to use the restroom.

, Dogs are unlikely to soil the areas where they sleep, like their crates. A crate will teach your puppy to control their bladder and bowels. However, keeping your puppy in their crate for too long will increase the likelihood that they will have an accident in their crate. Therefore, only keep your puppy in their crate for short periods of time, for example, an hour at most.If your Basset has an accident while in their crate, take them outside immediately. This will encourage and further solidify the association between eliminating and outside. Make sure to clean the area with an odor neutralizer to prevent your puppy from eliminating in the same spot again.

"
"
Purchase a crate.,
Make the crate comfortable.,
Crate your puppy for small amount of times.,
Place the crate in your room at night.",How to Raise a Basset Hound2," When purchasing the crate, make sure it is not too big. If the crate is too big, your puppy will still be able to eliminate in one corner and sleep in another. However, make sure the crate is not too small, as well. Your puppy should be able to lie, stand, and move around comfortably in their crate.Alternatively, you can purchase a crate that is appropriate for your Basset’s expected full-grown size. Use a divider to make the crate smaller, and adjust the divider as your puppy grows. Many crates come with dividers., Place a towel or blanket, toys, and treats inside your puppy’s crate. This will entice your puppy to explore the crate on their own. Once your puppy goes inside the crate on their own, reward them with praise and treats. At this point, do not shut the crate’s door right away. You want your puppy to have a positive association with their crate.Choose a word or phrase to say when your Basset enters the crate like, “Crate time,” “Go to your room,” or “Nap time.”
If you bought your puppy from a breeder who lives nearby, try dropping off a towel or blanket at the breeder’s place a few days before picking up your puppy. This way the litter can sleep on the blanket and leave their collective scent. Place this towel in your puppy’s crate to comfort your puppy., Once your puppy has no qualms about going into their crate on their own, select an appropriate time to enclose your puppy. An appropriate time to enclose your puppy is after they have eaten and eliminated outside. After you close the door, stay with your puppy and give them a new toy.If your puppy begins to cry, talk to them and reassure them by saying, “That’s a good boy (or girl). It’s ok, I’m here.”
Leave the puppy in the crate for only ten minutes. Slowly work your way up to longer periods of time.

, This way, your puppy will be comforted by your scent and will hopefully fall asleep more easily. Set your alarm for three hours so you can wake up to take your puppy outside to use the restroom. By setting an alarm, you will be able to take your puppy out of their crate before they begin to whine or cry. Therefore, you will not be rewarding bad behavior.Unless you know that your puppy needs to use the restroom or is hungry, do not take your puppy out of their crate when they whine or cry.

"

Expose your Basset to varying situations.,
Establish a daily routine.,
Teach your puppy basic commands.",How to Raise a Basset Hound3," In the first year of having your new puppy, expose them to unfamiliar dogs, people, and environments. Introduce them to people of varying ages, i.e., adults and children, and to both men and women in non-threatening environments.To expose your puppy to new environments and other dogs, take them to the park, for walks, and/or place them in a puppy kindergarten class.
Keep in mind that the first 18 weeks of your puppy’s life is the best time to socialize them. This is the period when they will be most open to new experiences. Take advantage of this window to raise a confident, well-adjusted adult dog.

, Show your puppy where their bed, toys, and food and water bowls are. Establish a routine for when it’s time to eat, play, use the restroom, go to bed, and wake up. This will provide the much-needed structure and security to your puppy’s life.For example, wake your puppy up at an established time in the morning, let them outside to use the restroom, and give your puppy their morning meal. Make sure your puppy eats and goes potty before bedtime, and have their bedtime at a certain time, as well.

, Begin teaching your puppy commands like “No” and “Good boy.” Once your puppy begins to understand these commands, begin to teach them more complex commands like sit, stay, and come. You can either teach them the more advanced commands yourself, or sign your puppy up for an obedience class.Find an obedience class at your local pet store, or ask your veterinarian for recommendations.

Inspect their ears.,
Check their nails.,
Exercise your puppy regularly.,
Consult your veterinarian.",How to Raise a Basset Hound4," Bassets have long ears that can harbor dampness and debris. Therefore, you will need to inspect your Basset’s ears regularly to avoid infections. Acclimate your puppy to having their ears inspected by practicing flipping their ears over for inspection.Reward your puppy with praise and treats for allowing you to inspect their ears.

, Basset’s nails tend to grow fast. Therefore, you will need to trim your puppy’s nails to prevent them from becoming too long. Your dog’s nails should be trimmed when they are just about to touch the ground when your puppy walks.Acclimate your Basset to having their nails clipped by handling their feet when they are still young. Rub your hand over their legs and paws, and gently press each individual toe. Reward your puppy with praise and treats for allowing you to touch their paws and toes.

, Bassets are very laid back, but they have a tendency to be lazy. Consequently, Bassets also have a tendency to become overweight and obese. Starting with their puppy years, provide your Basset with physical and mental exercise to prevent obesity.Take your Basset puppy outside for self-directed, off-leash play. Allow them to roam around, sniff, and dig.
Teaching your Basset commands and tricks will stimulate their mind and provide them with the mental exercise that they need.

, It is crucial to take your new Basset hound for an initial checkup as well as annual exams. They will need to be vaccinated, dewormed, and receive medication to protect them from heartworm. You should also discuss spaying/neutering with your veterinarian.


Your veterinarian will be able to recommend the best training methods for your Basset Hound. Also, ask your veterinarian about the appropriate activities that will enable you to fulfill your dog’s physical and mental exercise needs.
You can also ask your veterinarian for tips on how to thoroughly inspect your dog’s ears and keep them clean.

Evaluate whether a retired service dog would be a good fit for you.,
Prepare your home.,
Search for organizations that adopt retired police dogs.,
Submit an adoption application.,
Find out how the organization will notify you of its decision.,
Wait to see whether the organization approves your adoption application.

",How to Buy a Retired Police Dog," Retired police dogs are usually German Shepherds, Dutch Shepherds or Belgian Malinois. These breeds are extremely active and have been classified by the American Kennel Club (AKC) as part of the herding group.


Determine whether or not you will have the time for daily walks and play sessions with an adopted dog. All breeds selected for police service require large amounts of physical activity.
Think about whether a medium sized dog is a good fit for you and your household. A medium sized dog usually ranges in height from 21 to 27 inches (58.3 to 68.9 cm). If you are renting, your landlord may have weight and height restrictions for any pets. If you have limited living space, a medium sized dog may not have ample room to move about. Consider whether you have the physical strength to train and play with a medium sized dog on a daily basis.
Consider the dog's age. Although dogs available from rescue organizations may be younger, many retired service dogs will be older dogs and require frequent veterinary services.
Take into account that retired police dogs may have injuries, and you would need to pay special attention to their health problems. Request veterinary records and make sure you are able to accommodate the dog's injury or illness before you proceed with an adoption.;
, Most organizations that adopt out retired service dogs have requirements for the home environments offered by prospective adopters.


Make sure all fences are at least 6 feet (1.8 m) or higher.
Double check that all fencing and gates are in good repair.
Fix any problems you find before submitting an adoption application.

,


Contact breed specific rescue organizations for Belgian Malinois, German Shepherds, or Dutch Shepherds. Tell the person you speak with that you are interested in adopting a retired police dog. The representative at the organization can let you know if any dogs that trained or worked in K9 units are available for adoption. Ask the person to record your contact information if no police dogs currently need homes.
Check the K9 Global Training Academy's (K9 GTA) website to see if they are accepting applications for adoption of retired police dogs. The K9 GTA is a training organization located in Texas for police and military dogs that sometimes has retired service dogs available for adoption.

,


Give the adopting organization permission to interview your veterinarian and neighbors about your treatment of any pets--past or present. Most organizations want to make sure retired service dogs go to the best homes possible and verify that prospective owners are responsible pet owners before approving adoptions.
Provide all information requested in the application. Most applications for retired police or military dogs will specify that the household cannot have cats or children younger than age 8.

,


Each organization will have a different review process. Ask a contact person for a typical timeline of the adoption process and how you will be contacted. For example, the K9 GTA emails its decisions and will give a follow-up phone call to prospective owners who are approved for adoption.

Pick the right kind of leash.,
Avoid using punishment-based training techniques.,
Tackle the excitement associated with wearing a leash.,
Keep in mind why dogs pull on the Leash.,
Tackle the excitement of walking out the door.,
Teach the dog to stop pulling on the lead.This works best if you set aside plenty of time, and are prepared to not actually get as far as your intended destination.,
Reinforce positive behavior.,
Try an alternative method of training if you are not having success.,
Take your time with this training.",How to Train an Older Dog to Walk Calmly on a Leash," A dog that needs leash training could benefit from the use of a training lead. This is a short leash that keeps the dog at your side. This kind of leash will let you correct bad behavior quickly and effectively by redirecting the dog away from distractions. , A shock collar, choke chain, or prong collar has no place in retraining. While it might seem tempting to use a prong collar or choke chain, these work by inflicting pain and having the dog associate pain with pulling. Not only could these devices cause actual physical harm to the dog, but they work using fear rather than helping the dog to learn in a positive way.In addition, these collars are generally the mark of an inadequate trainer who doesn't know how to correct such behavior in any other way. Don't let this be a label applied to you, but instead retrain your dog in a humane manner using canine psychology., The chances are the dog is beside itself with excitement as soon as the leash appears. This is because it associates the leash with a walk. You want your pup to be calm when you set off, so that you are more likely to succeed in retraining.


To this end, clip the leash on and off the dog in the house, but without going for a walk. Your aim is to break the assumption that because the dog has a lead on it is going for a walk.For example, when you are home, clip the leash on but go about your normal routine in the house. After 5 - 10 minutes, unclip the leash and carry on as usual again. Repeat this every half hour or so, so the dog becomes desensitized to wearing the leash.

, Dogs most commonly pull because they are excited to get where they are going, which is usually an exciting place full of interesting smells such as the park. Dogs repeat behaviors when they get a reward from doing that behavior. In this case, the action of pulling on the lead is it's own reward because the dog perceives they get where they want to go more quickly.

, Once the dog is calm when you attach the leash, try taking it outside. This is likely to reboot the whole excitement thing, because this time it looks like the dog really is going for a walk. To counteract this, set aside plenty of time. Walk out the door with the dog, shut the door, pause, then re-enter the house.


Repeat this until both you and the dog are bored, and its lost all interest in pulling on the lead because the chances are it is going straight back inside and not on a walk.

, Put the dog on the lead and calmly leave the house. As soon as it starts to pull on the leash, stop dead in your tracks. Hold the leash firmly, but do not try to pull the dog back to you.


If your dog needs lots of exercise, try playing ball in the yard to tire it out beforehand so that it gets its exercise.
If you let him pull you to the park during the retraining period then you will undo all the good work done to date.

, When your dog turns its head to look at you, give a hearty ""GOOD DOGGY!"" then move forward and keep on walking. About every three or four times this happens, give the dog a treat.

, When the dog pulls, stop and set off walking in the opposite direction. If the dog then tanks ahead of you and pulls in the next direction, stop again and change direction. The message you are sending to the dog is that when it pulls it gets no further forward, therefore there is no point in pulling.Using this method, however, when the dog tries to get you to move faster, it results in you stopping, which means no movement at all. Pretty soon, the dog will realize that you and you alone are in control of the walks. You determine the time, place and speed. Once the dog has established this, it will no longer pull.

, It takes time to change ingrained behavior. Commit to daily training but don't assume that your dog will change its behavior after just a week. It may take a lot longer for your pup to get the messages you are sending it and make the changes you desire.


Hopefully, after about a month of taking walks like this, your dog will no longer be taking you for a walk!
Similarly, don't use this method for extended periods of time. It takes time and repetition more than extended training sessions. For instance, do not try to take long walks with this method. Your dog will soon tire or get bored from this training.

Learn about the breed.,
Make sure you want a puppy.,
Understand the dangers of buying from pet stores.,
Decide if AKC papers are important to you.",How to Buy a Siberian Husky Puppy1," Before you make the decision to purchase a Siberian Husky puppy you should make sure the breed is right for you. Siberian Huskies are fun but changeling dogs. You should make sure your lifestyle matches up with the needs of a husky.


Siberians love people and tend to make loyal family dogs. They're intelligent and highly trainable breeds and love walking, hiking, and other athletic activities.Siberians are notoriously poor watchdogs as they tend to like everyone, even potential intruders. This can be a good thing, however, if you're looking for a people friendly dog.Siberians do tend to have predatory drives, which means they may chase cats or other small animals in your home. If you have cats, you might want to consider a different breed or discuss your concerns with a dog trainer.Siberians have some downsides. They tend to have issues with digging and running and sometimes do not come when called. They also shed a lot, in great amounts at least once a year.Siberians need a lot of physical activity to remain happy and healthy. If you're not committed to daily exercise, like running and walking, you should consider a different breed.;
, A new puppy is can be an exciting addition to your home, but also a big time commitment. Make sure you weigh the pros and cons of adopting a puppy before the beginning the process.


A new puppy will probably not be housebroken and while she might have learned a few basic commands from her former caregiver, she'll need a lot of training. It takes awhile for a puppy to learn boundaries and you need to be able to make time to train your new pet. If you have a very busy schedule, an adult dog might be a better option.
Another issue regarding adopting a puppy is that purebred Siberian Husky puppies usually much be purchased from a breeder. If you have reservations about buying from a breeder over a rescue, know you're unlikely to find a puppy through the many Siberian Husky rescues that operate throughout the country. Rescues usually house older dogs who have been abandon by previous owners. If your heart is set on buying from a rescue, you will likely have to adopt an older dog., If you want to buy a Siberian Husky puppy, you should avoid doing so at a pet store. Only buy from reputable breeders who practice good ethics in regards to caring for and raising their puppies.


Pet stores keep puppies in conditions many find unethical. Puppies are generally kept in cramped cages. While many pet store owners claim they only buy from responsible breeders, ethical breeders would never sell to a pet store.Reputable breeders do genetic testing on their dogs to make sure they're not passing down detrimental health conditions. The breeders who do business with pet shops usually do not perform genetic testing and a puppy you would get from a pet store might have serious health and costly conditions later in life.Buying from a pet shop means you will not get to meet a puppy's parents. You will also not get to see a puppy interact with her litter. This makes it difficult to get a gauge of a dog's personality and know whether or not a puppy is right for you and your home.Pet shop puppies frequently have behavioral issues due to being confined to a cage for a long period. They might nip and tend to be hyperactive and difficult to train and control., Many breeders boast their puppies come with an AKC registration. This may or may not matter to you depending on why you are purchasing a dog.


AKC stands for American Kennel Association. AKC registration papers are granted to any puppy as long as both their parents were also AKC registered. It does not say anything about the health or personality of the puppy. In other words, an AKC registration does not guarantee a higher quality puppy.If you don't plan on breeding or showing your Husky at a professional level, you probably don't need AKC registration papers. A puppy that's just intended to be a pet probably does not need papers. There's nothing inherently wrong with a breeder offering AKC papers, but if you're not planning on showing or breeding you don't need to limit your search to breeders offering AKC papers.You might want to ask to see the puppy's pedigree, however. In terms of gauging behavior and potential health problems, a pedigree is probably more important. You can see if there's been a lot inbreeding in your puppy's family history. Puppies prone to inbreeding tend to have more health and behavioral problems."

Call local breeders in your area to find out what options are available to you., Some rescue organizations will train their dogs to help find them new homes. Contact rescue organizations in your area to see if they offer obedience training to their dogs.Even if they don’t train the dogs themselves, let them know about your interest in a trained dog. They may have dogs that were trained before joining them.

, Working dogs are those employed by agencies for security or detection work. These dogs may be adopted from the organizations that once employed them. As they are retired dogs, they may be a little older.


Military Working Dogs were trained for use in the army. They have been deemed safe to live in a normal household environment and may be adopted for free from the Military Working Dog School in Texas.Occasionally, police departments or security organizations, such as the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), will offer retired work dogs for adoption.Service dog training organizations occasionally have younger dogs who were trained but who did not fulfill all of the requirements of their certification. They usually have been trained well enough to live in a normal home., Occasionally, vets or trainers will know of people who are looking to rehome their dogs. You can ask your vet or call a local dog training academy to see if they know of anyone who needs a home for a trained dog.


While training academies typically do not sell trained dogs themselves, they can still point you in the right direction. Furthermore, by contacting them, you might find a good trainer to help you if you do end up buying an untrained dog.

Know how to recognize a good breeder.,
Search for a breeder in your area.,
Contact the breeder and arrange a meeting.",How to Buy a Siberian Husky Puppy2," You want to make sure you find a solid breeder. Know how to identify a good breeder before you agree to purchase a puppy.


Good breeders want to meet with potential buyers before making a sale. This is because responsible and ethical dog breeders want to make sure their puppies go to good homes. If a breeder asks a lot of questions, don't be alarmed. This is a positive thing. It means the breeder cares about the health and safety of her puppies.A good breeder will also be respectful of you and allow you to ask questions. The breeder you buy from should have no reservations about allowing you to meet and interact with both the mother and the father of the puppies.A good breeder should be able to provide you with health certificates for all the puppies in a litter. These certificates will assure you your puppy is not prone to any breed-specific health concerns., Once you know how to recognize the markings of a quality breeder, you can begin your search.


The internet is a wonderful resource to find breeders. The AKC has a website that allows you to search for breeders by breed and locations.The Siberian Husky Club of America also has a breeder referral list on their website.It's not always possible to find a refutable breeder within a reasonable distance. You might have to make a few overnight trips to meet with a breeder, so be prepared for that if you're committed to getting a Siberian Husky.

, Once you've selected a breeder, contact them and inquire about meeting the puppies.


Choose a breeder who has a current or upcoming litter. Many breeders only breed their dogs once every 2 to 3 years, so you want to pick someone who has puppies available now or will soon.Be prepared to answer questions about who lives in your family, whether all your family members want the puppy, and whether the puppy will be properly confined at your home. Good breeders do not sell puppies to anyone.
If you have any questions about the breed, the breeder is a good person to ask. She should be able to clear up any questions you have.See when you can come by the meet the puppies. Remember, you will probably not leave with a puppy on the same day you meet the litter. Good breeders will want you to take time to think about your decision.

"

Watch the litter as a group.,
Interact with available puppies one by one.,
Ask to see health certificates of the the puppy and her parents.,
Take time to think it over.",How to Buy a Siberian Husky Puppy3," Observe the puppies as a group first. You can learn a lot about a puppy's temperament by watching how they behave during group interactions.


Puppies who are timid are a bad sign. Even if only a few puppies seem shy, bark, and avoid contact, there's a good chance such behaviors are part of their genes. This means that even if certain puppies are friendly now, the tendencies towards skittishness might come out later.Normal puppies will be friendly and trusting of strangers. They should greet you by jumping and nibbling on your clothes or shoelaces. Many people bulk at such behaviors as they worry the puppies are disobedient or hyperactive. This is probably not the case. They simply have not learned boundaries yet, which is a good thing. They're naturally trusting.Watch for the puppies that seem neither too timid nor too bossy. You don't want to end up with a skittish puppy but you also do not want an alpha who might be hard to train., After you've observed the puppies as a group, ask to see the ones you're interested in individually.


You need to get a sense of how a puppy behaves when separated from her littermates. Ideally, the puppy will continue to be calm and friendly even away from the pack.While interacting with the puppies one on one, take the opportunity to ask questions. Your breeder should have insights on each puppy's personality that you might miss in a short visit.

, Once you've selected a puppy, you should request to see the health certificates of that puppy as well as her parents.


Siberian huskies are generally pretty healthy, but certain genetic health issues should be a warning sign. Siberian huskies are prone to chronic conditions that require longterm, costly treatment.Hip dysplasia is a condition in which the thigh bone fits improperly into the hip socket. Severe cases require surgery and can cause other problems, such as arthritis. Hip dysplasia can be devastating for dogs who love to run and pull. If you see a history of hip dysplasia, be wary. Seriously consider the possibility your puppy may eventually develop the condition and whether or not you could financially and emotionally handle the situation.Eye problems, like juvenile cataracts and corneal dystrophy, can also be a problem in Siberian Huskies. These tend to start early, sometimes before the age of 2, and cannot usually be corrected by surgery. Blindness is a potential result and while most Siberians can get around all right blind, if you're nervous about raising a blind dog you might want to go to another breeder if eye problems run in your puppy's family.Remember, most dogs will have some kind of health problem documented on their medical records. If it's not a chronic condition of the joints or eyes, your puppy is unlikely to inherit it. However, even if your puppy's parents do not have a history of certain health conditions, this is not necessarily a guarantee your puppy will be free of longterm health problems. Even without a genetic predisposition hip and eye problems can develop, but having healthy parents does reduce their likelihood., After visiting the puppies, you should take some time to consider which puppy you want.


Even if you have your heart set on a particular puppy, give it at least a day. You want to be completely sure of your decision when you purchase a new puppy. Having to return a pet is an emotionally difficult experience.
If possible, see if you can visit the puppies again if you're unsure which one you want. A good breeder is unlikely to pressure you into a fast decision. They're invested in making sure their puppies have happy, healthy longterm homes.

Research adoptable dogs online.,
Talk to the staff.,
Look at older dogs.,
Visit with the dog.",How to Buy Already Trained Dogs2," Most shelters will post profiles of their dogs on their website. Before you visit the shelter in person, read through their website so that you can identify dogs who might be a good fit for you. Some may even let you search for trained dogs. You might look for a dog advertised as being housebroken, leash trained, or good with children.

, Inform the staff members at an animal shelter that you are looking for a dog that has already been trained. In most cases, the staff members will be familiar with the personality and history of every dog that resides in the shelter. They can introduce you to dogs that are trained. You might ask them:Do you have any dogs that are already housetrained?
Which dogs are good with children?
May I see dogs that are leash-trained?
Are there any dogs that have been crate trained already?
Which dogs have lived in a house or apartment before?
Are there any dogs that already respond to their name?
Which dogs are responsive to commands?
Was this dog a stray or surrendered by their owner? If they were given up, why?

, Older dogs are more likely to be house and leash trained, and they may even know some basic commands. They will also be easier to take care of than younger dogs, as they will not have the behavioral or chewing problems of puppies. When at the shelter, consider adopting a senior dog.Keep in mind that older dogs may have more health issues than younger dogs.
It may take a few weeks for your dog to feel comfortable around you after adoption. This does not necessarily mean that they are poorly trained, but rather that you will still need to take the time to bond with and interact with your new pet., Many shelters will have an area where you can visit and play with the dog to see if their temperament suits you. This is a good opportunity to test the dog’s training. Try out a few commands with the dog, such as “come here” and “sit.” Get to know the dog, so that you can make an informed decision.


Remember that the dog may respond to many different commands. Try several out to see which they answer to. For example, say “sit,” “down,” “lie down,” and “stay” to see which one works on the dog.
Older dogs may be anxious around new people. You may never know what happened to them before they came to the shelter, and living in a kennel can be traumatic. Remember to keep an open mind and be patient with these dogs. With time and care, they may turn into a loving pet.

You can consult with a vet, doctor, or physical therapist for recommendations.


The American Kennel club offers a listing of approved service dog organizations.

, Each organization will have a unique set of procedures for adopting a trained dog from them. You should contact as many of these organizations as you can to find a dog that is best-suited for your lifestyle and needs. Furthermore, many organizations have waiting lists, so you should factor time into your decision.When you contact them, you should ask:“How long is your waiting list?”
“Do you offer training programs to the new owners to help them bond with the service animal?”
“Why type of certification and documentation do you offer for the dog?”
“How are the dogs trained? Are they housebroken? Crate trained?”
“How much will it cost to buy a service dog from you?”
“How old will the dog be when they are released to me?”

Never ever send money by Western Union or MoneyGram.",How to Buy a Puppy Online Safely," Consider finding a breeder that’s close enough to make a personal visit. Visiting a breeder’s facilities is one of the clearest ways to see how legitimate they are. Trust breeders who are proud to show you their property.If they don't want to show off their facilities or take pride in them, steer clear.
Ask to see the facilities in full when you visit. Look for clean conditions and animals’ general demeanors to gauge the breeder’s quality. Dogs should be friendly, social, and not shy away from you or other visitors.
Make sure the location breeds only one or a few types of dogs. The breeder should not specialize in more than a few breeds and should provide living space appropriate for dogs' size and breed.They should be knowledgeable about their breeds' characteristics, history, and any potential genetic or developmental concerns. They should openly and clearly help you understand the type of dog you're buying.;
, If you find a breeder that’s too far away to visit, ask for a phone number, or call the number posted on their website. While email will probably be your initial means of communicating, never a buy a puppy unless you’ve spoken directly to the breeder.Breeders who ask to speak on the phone or volunteer their phone number in the first few emails are the most trustworthy. Look for a breeder who is easily accessible and is open about their contact information.
If they don't offer a phone number right away, try writing, ""I'd really like to speak over the phone. I'm more comfortable making a purchase from someone I've had a conversation with, and I have a lot of questions about the process.""
Cross check the area code with the location of the breeder. If they don’t match, find another breeder.

, When you contact your potential breeder, ask for references from previous clients. Look on their website for testimonials or other credentials. If they have a social media page, look through their comments.


Try asking, ""Is there anywhere I can read testimonials from past customers? Do you have a list of reviews available, or offer any references? Do you have ties to any nearby shelters or humane societies?""

, Search online to find a vet near the breeder's location, and call them to ask if they know anything about their breeding practices. You should also think about contacting nearby shelters or trainers to ask about the breeder's quality and reputability.


Ask them if they've heard of that particular breeder and if they know anything about their practices.
Ask if they have any recommendations, especially if you're doing research on a breeder in your own area.

, When you speak with the breeder on the phone, pay attention to the questions they ask you. Don’t trust a breeder who isn’t interested in learning more about you, as they are more likely to be interested only in making money.They should ask you if you’ve ever owned a dog, why you are interested in purchasing a dog, and about details regarding your family and who will be the primary caregiver.

, Don’t settle for the pictures that advertise your prospective dog online. Ask the breeder to see a range of photographs from different ages. In addition, ask the breeder to place a small card in photographs of the dog with your name or the date written on it.Ask for several angles so you can verify that the card wasn’t edited into the image.
Also ask the breeder to see photos of your potential dog’s parents.

, The easiest way to avoid an online scam is to adopt from a local shelter or breed rescue club. Adopting instead of shopping online will eliminate all risks associated with buying online, including having your money stolen or never receiving your dog. In addition, adopting helps curb pet overpopulation, and avoids the risk of supporting a puppy mill, which mass produces animals in poor living conditions., When searching online for a reliable breeder, you’ll find plenty of legitimate ads on sites that list classifieds for free. However, you’ll have to spend extra time double checking these ads. Online scammers are more likely to post on sites that do not require a fee to post ads, such as Craigslist., Online scams typically copy and paste text from legitimate breeder sites. They also lift photographs from legitimate websites, but caption them incorrectly.Look for passages of text that seem inconsistent, as if one paragraph were stolen from a legitimate source and the next poorly written.
Look for photographs that are captioned incorrectly. For example, you might see a picture of one breed but its caption names it another breed.
Check for watermarks on the images that were placed there by a legitimate breeder. If it doesn’t match the name of the website you’re looking at, contact that name posted on the watermark.
Look for any blurry marks that might be covering up watermarks.

, Beware of rock bottom prices far below a breed’s standard. Look online for a variety of breeders, and email or call them to ask about their pricing. Make a trip to a local pet store or look at their website to get a better idea of what a standard price looks like.


If you see an outlier, or a price that’s far below most of the others you’ve seen, it’s probably a scam.

, If you suspect a website of being fraudulent, you can report it to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) if you’re in the United States. Use their toll free hotline: 877-FTC-HELP (877-382-4357). You can also fill out an online complaint form on their website: http://www.ftc.gov

, Puppy finder companies check the breeder's background, examine the puppy's health, and make sure the puppy's pedigree is in order. They also ensure vaccinations are up to date and help you with language issues and transportation if necessary.


A legitimate puppy finder company will have a proven track record, previous customers you can talk to, and a social media page where you can double check comments.
Puppy finders are not escrow companies. In other words, they don’t hold money until you receive your money in order to secure the transaction. If a breeder or puppy finder makes any such claims, they are most likely illegitimate.

, The breeder should provide a thorough contract that includes a health guarantee. A good breeder will have you agree to return the dog in the event that you can no longer care for it. In addition, they will provide documentation proving the dog’s breeding line has been tested for genetic and other health defects., A good breeder will offer a guarantee in case your puppy or dog shows signs of health problems within the first several days of ownership. Take your new dog to the vet within 24 hours of picking it up or having it shipped.Ask the breeder about their guarantee prior to finalizing your purchase. If they don’t offer a guarantee, find another breeder.

, Never use an unsecured wire transfer service when making a purchase online. If something goes wrong, these services will not help you get your money back.Use your credit or debit card that will allow you to dispute a transaction.
Before handing over your credit card number, ask the breeder for their merchant number. Call your credit card company to verify that the number is legitimate.

Rescue a Pomeranian.,
Research Pomeranians.,

Learn the breed standards.",How to Buy a Pomeranian," Any breed of dog that you adopt will require your time and energy, and although Pomeranians are small, they are no exception. It’s important to honestly evaluate your schedule to determine if you have enough free time to give your Pomeranian. Also, consider if your lifestyle is appropriate for this energetic, small breed.Dogs need to be walked frequently or house trained to eliminate in a designated place.
Pomeranians require frequent brushings or their hair will knot up.
If you enjoy long hikes and imagine bringing your dog with you, for example, a larger breed may be more appropriate.;
, Pomeranians are typically outgoing and energetic and can make a fantastic family pet. They require training, though, and cannot be expected to be a great family dog naturally. If you have small children and little time to train a puppy or someone in the home that won’t tolerate a Pomeranian’s high energy, you might do well to consider another breed.This is a great time to ask your family what they imagine when they think about getting a dog. Do they imagine a large protector? Or perhaps a dog to which they can throw tennis balls? Maybe they envision a lap dog or one that they can dress up in fun costumes. Finding out what they expect can help you decide which breed is best for your family.
Simply ask them, “Pomeranians are small and full of energy. They require a big investment of time, and we’ll need to work together on that. Do you think that your schedule will allow you time to brush, feed, walk, play with, and train the dog?”
Also reassure them, “It’s good to be perfectly honest about what you want and think you can do for a dog. It’s better that we talk about it now and are as realistic as possible, rather than be surprised after we bring a dog into our home.”

, Purebred puppies are expensive, especially toy breeds like Pomeranians. This is not the only Pomeranian-related cost that you need to think about. Your dog will need proper care, such as regular veterinarian visits, shots, and preventative medicines for fleas, ticks, and heartworms. Your Pomeranian will also need good-quality food, dishes, a collar, tag, microchip, and toys. Additionally, you’ll need to budget for pet emergencies.You may choose to groom your Pomeranian at home, which will cut some costs; however, you will need to purchase your supplies.
You can also take your Pomeranian to a professional groomer. This is more expensive, but it saves you time.
A good cost-cutting option is to purchase pet insurance, which may help pay for medications, vet visits, and emergencies.

, Puppy mills are exactly what the name suggests – sites that generate quantities of puppies with little to no regard for quality of life or breed standard. Often parent dogs are kept in filthy, disease-ridden conditions and in failing health. Puppy mill puppies may be cute, but they usually have a list of health conditions that can be quite expensive for their new families. There are some red flags to look for that might indicate you’re dealing with a puppy mill.Puppy mills almost always disguise themselves as a legitimate breeder or rescue organization, so it’s worth researching the location before you buy.
Advertisements that appear regularly in the classified section or online.
A breeder that won’t tell you their veterinarian’s information.
A breeder or organization that always seems to have dogs available for purchase.

, Unless a pet store is offering dogs for adoption from a local animal shelter, it is almost guaranteed that they are selling puppy mill dogs. No business will admit to this, and you might even go to a pet store that tells you that they only use reputable breeders. This just isn’t the case. No breeder could keep up with the demand of a pet store, nor would a responsible breeder allow their puppies to be sold via a third party like a pet store.If the pet store insists that they use reputable breeders, get the name and address and verify the information for yourself. Any reputable breeder will invite you for a site inspection.

, Popular breeds, especially in the Toy class, such as Pomeranians, are pervasive in puppy mills and backyard breeders across the country. The name backyard breeder doesn’t mean that someone breeds dogs in their backyard. Instead, it means someone that breeds a large number of dogs or allows their dogs to breed carelessly. Hobby breeders, on the other hand, usually only have a couple of dogs that they monitor very closely, have genetically tested the dogs to ensure that they aren’t reproducing bad genes, and love the breed.Backyard breeders are typically not interested in making money, don’t fancy themselves breeders, and don’t have their dogs tested for genetic conditions. They usually don’t have much knowledge about breed standards or training.
Hobby breeders are usually pretty passionate about the one breed that they work with and are careful about which animals they breed and take caution to not over-breed the animals. Hobby breeders are familiar with breed standards, training needs, medical needs, and will have the puppies properly vetted before sale.

, A good breeder will register with an organization, such as the American Kennel Club. They will also only breed the very best dogs, sometimes working with other breeders to bring two exemplary dogs together. A registered, reputable Pomeranian breeder will be happy to show you their facilities, allow you to meet their dogs, and walk you through why their dogs are worth breeding.


Most breeders will also interview prospective buyers to ensure that the dogs will be placed in a forever home.
Many Pomeranian breeders will require you to sign a contract at the time of purchase that stipulates everything from living conditions to rehoming.
The AKC website has a list of registered Pomeranian breeders., There are organizations around the world devoted to rescuing dogs, and some are specifically for Pomeranian rescues.You’ll find a range of ages, sizes, and health conditions in rescues. Rescues are also passionate about their dogs, and will likely ask you to sign a contract and fill out a questionnaire about your living conditions. There are several advantages to adopting a Pomeranian from a rescue:


They are usually housebroken.
The rescue will tell you how the dog interacts with dogs, cats, and children.
You will know any medical conditions up front.
The adoption fee is significantly less than purchasing from a breeder.
You can adopt an older dog, who may be trained, if you don’t want to endure the “puppy” phase.

, Familiarize yourself with the Pomeranian breed so that you can confidently decide whether this is the breed for you or not. Read books and conduct Internet research about the Pomeranian breed so you know how to properly care for them and know common personality traits and possible quirks.Pomeranians are a toy breed, meaning they are quite small, ranging from 3-7 pounds.
They are very energetic, seeming to have a limitless supply of energy.
They tend to get along well with other dogs and people.
They are incredibly alert and attentive.
They may bark a lot, especially if they hear an unfamiliar sound or see an unfamiliar person.

, In your research, you’ll also learn exactly what a Pomeranian is not. You may have expectations of your future dog, and it’s good to find out if a typical Pomeranian will fit the bill. Remember, though, that each dog has its own unique personality and can defy the rules.Pomeranians are not work dogs and tend to be relatively fragile.
Low maintenance – Pomeranians require regular bathing and brushing.
Quiet – Pomeranians tend to bark frequently at unfamiliar people, dogs, or other animals outside the family circle. If everyday barking bothers you, a Pomeranian is probably not the dog for you.
Easy to house train – smaller dogs are typically more difficult to house train than their larger counterparts.

, The American Kennel Club has established the breed standard for Pomeranians and other purebred canines, and have made that information available on their website.It’s good to be familiar with breed standards so that you know what to look for when you’re shopping for a Pomeranian, and also so that you can spot any issues that emerge as your dog matures.


The Pomeranian has a dense, double coat and a heavily-plumed tail.
The dog will have a short muzzle and dark, round eyes.
The upper and lower length of the legs should be approximately equal.
The dog will have a black nose with natural browning.

Make sure you find a responsible breeder who avoids inbreeding, maintains good kennel conditions, and fulfills and exceeds all applicable legal standards.Avoid buying a puppy at your local pet store as they are often bred by puppy mills for quick profit.
Make sure your breeder is genuinely interested in the welfare of their dogs. They will ask you plenty of questions about a puppy’s potential home and make recognizable efforts to make sure you’re a good fit.
Don’t do business with a breeder who is will to simply take money without asking you about your fitness as a dog owner.

, Pay a personal visit to the breeding facility in order to inspect facilities for cleanliness and quality of life. Don’t trust a breeder if they aren’t open and welcoming, or if they don’t allow you to see the entire facility.Avoid breeders that insist on meeting you at a location other than their facility. This indicates that they are hiding something or don’t want you to see unsatisfactory conditions.
If you have a specific puppy in mind, meet the stud dog and the brood bitch if possible. If you find the parents’ temperaments bothersome, then consider finding a different breeder.

, The breeder should volunteer their veterinarian's contact information, and should offer proof that the puppy has received a full vet exam. If they vaccinated the puppy themselves, ask for a record that shows the date of vaccination, its expiration date, manufacturer, and lot number.Breeders who can offer vaccination papers from a licensed vet are generally more reliable than breeders who offer treatments themselves.
Ask to see records showing that the puppy's parents were screened for genetic disorders, parasites, and other health concerns.

, If you have located a great breeder but there are no puppies currently available, give them your contact information and wait for the next litter. Consider making a non-binding sales agreement, but don’t obligate yourself to purchasing a puppy before you have seen, at the very least, its photograph.


Ask for a rough timeline from the breeder, and keep in touch to stay informed about new litters.

, Before bringing your new puppy home, make sure you put away all hazardous items, such as small objects, breakables, and potential poisons. Look for any objects that might harm your puppy or that your puppy might damage.Tuck away electrical cords and keep an eye on your new puppy around outlets and other electrical hazards.
Be sure to purchase a bed, toys, leash, food, and other necessities. Ask the breeder for any specific items that might be useful for that breed of dog.
Consult your breeder about whether you will feed your puppy dry or canned pet food, or a raw diet.

, A good breeder will keep the puppy with its litter for the first couple months. This provides the puppy with much-needed early socialization, as it will be used to being around its littermates.


A puppy picked up too early can be fearful of other dogs and people.
The puppy also benefits from not being weaned off its mother's milk too early.

, Start heartworm and tick prevention right away. Make sure you have documentation of all required vaccinations. Keep in mind a reputable breeder will also provide a guarantee that you can return the puppy if your veterinarian discovers a serious health condition within the first few days of ownership.

, Get your puppy on a feeding, sleeping, and bathroom schedule as soon as possible. Begin training with command words, like sit, stay, and come. Make training fun and low-stress, especially when you first welcome your new pet into your home.Consider taking it to puppy obedience classes. Ask your vet or breeder to suggest a facility.
Establish the same expectations for your puppy as you will have from an adult dog, and be consistent about your house rules from the start. For example, if you don’t want your dog to beg for food, don’t give it table scraps when it’s a puppy.
Make sure to take it outside to use the bathroom every two to three hours. Puppies haven’t yet developed control over their bathroom functions, so don’t get upset with it if it has an accident.

Bring your puppy home.",How to Buy a Pug Puppy," Pug puppies come with a unique set of needs. Puppies in general require more care than an adult dog. Before embarking on your journey to find a pug puppy, consider whether you can accommodate one at the moment.Make sure you have time for a puppy. Puppies need extra feeding, as well socialization and training. If you have a very busy schedule, you may want to wait for things to settle down before getting a puppy.
Pugs, as a pet, require some maintenance. The folds in their faces need regular cleaning, and they're also prone to a great deal of shedding. Make sure you can live with frequent grooming, and accept the fact your house will never quite be hair-free.;
, Like all breeds, pugs are prone to certain health problems. While a good breeder is adept at breeding out such problems, there are certain problems that are hard to breed out. These are usually simply due to how a pug is built. Learn the risks associated with pugs and make sure you're prepared to deal with them down the road.All pugs, regardless of breeding, are prone to eye problems. Due to their bulging eyes, pugs are likely to get dust and debris trapped in their eyes. You may have to deal with frequent vet visits to deal with eye issues.
Pugs are very prone to overheating because of their thick coats. Their coat is present year-round, which means you will always have to make sure your pug is not too hot. Overheating can cause serious health issues for a pug.
Behaviorally, pugs are a more social breed. They are more prone to separation anxiety issues than other breeds. If you're gone a lot, a pug may not be the right dog for you.

, When searching for a breeder, there are a few places to scratch off your list right away. Puppy mills and very obviously bad breeders should be avoided. You're more likely to get a pug with existing health problems, or the risk of developing health problems down the road.In general, do not trust a breeder who simply sells dogs online from any given buyer. A breeder who does not ask any questions is probably not a good breeder. Responsible breeders want to make sure their dogs go to good homes.
Puppy mills sometimes sell puppies to pet stores, so avoid buying a pug from a pet store. Puppy mills may also sell pugs online. If you can simply look at a picture of a puppy and purchase it, this is probably a puppy mill.

, Start your search locally. If you're lucky, you will be able to find a breeder who lives nearby. Look for ads in the newspaper, online, at local pet stores and veterinary clinics, and at any local pet clubs. A breeder in your area is convenient, as you will not have to travel far to see the puppies.Just because someone is a local breeder, do not assume they are an ethical one. Make sure to visit any breeder in person and look at the puppies physically before purchasing one.

, Unfortunately, not all areas have pug breeders close by. In some cases, you may have to travel to meet and select a puppy. There are many places you can look online to locate the nearest pug breeder.The Pug Dog Club keeps a list of reputable breeders online. You can search for the closest breeder there.
The American Kennel Club also has a database of dog breeders. You can search there by breed.
Remember to have patience. Even if you find a good breeder relatively close to you, they may not have puppies available for awhile. You may have to wait a few months before taking home your pug puppy.

, Call a few breeders during your search. Pay close attention to your interactions. Learn the signs of a good breeder. Only work with breeders who are responsible and care about their dogs.A good breeder is eager to have you visit. Their facilities should be clean and spacious. They will be flexible in scheduling a time for you to see the puppies.
A solid breeder will usually only breed one type of dog, or only a few types of dogs. The breeder should be very knowledgable of pugs. During your initial conversation, the breeder will want to go over some basic pug care information with you.
Good breeders do not have anything to hide. Not only will the be willing to let you see the dog's pedigree and meet their parents, they will actually encourage this.

, When you select a breeder to meet up with, make sure to ask a variety of questions. You want to make sure their puppies are a good match for you and your home. You also want to make sure the breeder is responsible and that the puppies are in good health.Ask to meet the dog's parents. Interacting with a dog's mother and father can give you a sense of your puppy's future temperament.
Ask questions about the breeder's credentials. Ask how long they've been breeding pugs. A more experienced breeder is more likely to produce healthier puppies.
Ask about the puppy's parents. Make sure the parents do not have any inheritable diseases. Ask if you can see the health certificates for the parents on request.
You should also ask about what treatment the puppies have received. Have they been vaccinated or de-wormed? Have they been spayed or neutered yet?

, When you get a chance to interact with the puppies, look closely at the puppy's you like. Pugs are prone to certain abnormalities. You can detect a potential issue by examining the dog's eyes, as well as how it breathes and moves.The eyes should not have any obvious problems. Watery eyes, squinted eyes, or glazed over eyes are signs of poor health.
Hold the puppy close to you to hear it breathe. Raspy, labored breathing is generally a bad sign. Watch the puppy moving and at rest. It's not uncommon for pugs to breath through their mouths when running around. However, a resting puppy should be able to comfortably breath through its nose.
There should be no signs of limping or an uneven gain if the puppies are old enough to walk. If you notice a puppy walking funny, listen for a clicking noise from the hips. This indicates the dog may develop hip problems later in life.

, As you interact with the puppies, aim for one with a good temperament. You want a puppy that's not too shy, but also one that's not overly rambunctious.Select a puppy that's friendly, but relatively relaxed. You want a puppy that allows you to pick it up without squirming. A very aggressive or very standoffish puppy can be a problem.
Once you've selected two or three pugs you like, request one-on-one time with them. You want a puppy that is friendly away from its litter. A friendly puppy will wag its tail, allow you to pet it, and look at you when you talk.

, A good breeder will be as scrutinizing of you as you are of them. Breeders want to make sure their dogs go to good homes, so don't be put off if a breeder asks you a lot of questions. This is a good sign. The breeder wants to make sure you will take good care of the puppy. The breeder will want to know what experience, if any, you have with raising pugs. They will also want to know about your general lifestyle and how you plan to care for the dog.
If this is your first pug, don't panic. A breeder is unlikely to reject you simply because you don't have specific experience with pugs. As long as you've done some research on the breed, the breeder will probably be willing to sell to you if you're responsible.

, A good breeder will always be willing to provide this information. After selecting the puppy you want, ask for its pedigree as well as a certificate of health. These papers should assure you the puppy is in good health, and that its family tree is relatively free of inheritable conditions.A health certificate is also good for practical reasons. Puppies need frequent vet visits. You should have a certification on hand showing what vaccinations and other treatments your dog has already received.

, As you prepare to bring your puppy home, make sure you're ready. Your puppy should enter your home with all the supplies it needs to thrive ready. You will need the following:A crate to transport your puppy home and for crate training later
Bedding
Baby gates
Collar, leash, and identification tag
Toys
Bowls
Grooming supplies (i.e., nail clipper, brush)
Carpet cleaner and pet odor remover

, Before bringing your dog home, you will need to pug proof your house. Pugs are inquisitive animals and prone to getting into things. You want to make sure your pug cannot get into any dangerous substances or places.Make sure all electrical wires are covered or out of reach.
Keep things like household cleaners and detergents out of reach. Place them in high kitchen cabinets.
Prevent access to staircases, as young pugs can easily slip and fall on the stairs.

, A good breeder will present you with a contract prior to purchase. This outlines your basic responsibilities and the breeder's return policy. Read the contract carefully before signing. If there's anything you don't understand, ask the breeder.Make sure there is a clause in the contract that states you can return the pug if it has an inheritable disorder. You want the option of returning a dog in the event it has a health problem you cannot afford to treat.

, Once the contract is signed and your home is ready, you can bring your new friend home. You can now enjoy your pug puppy, and begin the process of training and caring for your new lifelong friend.

Consider why you need a dog for protection.,
Make sure you have the resources to purchase and keep a dog.,
Choose a breed.,
Be aware of your responsibilities or restrictions.,
Consider the level of training you require.,
Consult with law enforcement offices in your area.,
Contact local animal shelters or animal rescue groups.,
Search online for trainers or organizations.,
Verify that the dog suits your needs.,
Shop around and compare prices.,
Make sure the dog is in good health.,
Ask for instructions on handling the dog.",How to Buy a Personal Protection Dog," Trained protection dogs can be expensive and difficult to care for. They are specifically trained to protect you, your valuables, or your home in cases of danger, and are therefore altogether different than an ordinary guard dog.A personal protection dog is more like a police dog or K-9 unit in terms of training and purpose. The major difference is that they are used in a defensive manner, rather than offensive. In other words, they’re intended to defend you rather than go after a criminal.
Make sure your protection dog is trained for defensive purposes, especially if you go for a retired police or military dog. Ask its former handlers if they believe the dog might go on the offensive and become a neighborhood nuisance.Consider purchasing a protection dog if you are a high profile figure, are under an authentic security risk, are in possession of a high-value or irreplaceable item, or suffer from a disability.;
, Purchasing a trained personal protection dog can cost from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. In addition to upfront cost, it can cost several hundred dollars a year to pay for food, veterinary care, and incidental costs. Further, like all large dogs, they require substantial space, routine exercise, and an owner who can play the alpha role.If you cannot fulfill all of these obligations, purchasing a protection dog or other large dog may not be appropriate.

, While searching for a personal protection dog, you’ll likely come across numerous breeds available for purchase. However, two particular breeds stand out as the best in terms of trainability, reliability, temperament. You should therefore consider purchasing either a German Shepherd Dog or a Belgian Malinois as a personal protection dog.These breeds are most often used as protection dogs or K-9 units by police and military.
When considering the breed of the dog, you should also attend to its lineage. When you talk to a trainer or seller, ask if the dog’s family line was also used for protective services. Preferably, your protection dog should be bred from a line of dogs used for similar purposes.

, Consider whether your homeowner’s insurance or other insurance policies will allow you to own a specific breed of dog, particularly one trained for protection. Familiarize yourself with your legal responsibilities in the event your dog bites someone, whether or not that person is intruding on your property or threatening you.Check the Animal Law Resource Center to find information about state and local laws: http://www.animallaw.com/

Some insurance policies and some legal jurisdictions prohibit breeds labeled as “aggressive.” Double check both of these, as well as your homeowner’s association, apartment complex, or any applicable governing body.

, Know that there is a difference between a guard dog and a personal protection dog. A guard dog is simply intended or trained to bark in instances of danger. A personal protection dog, on the other hand, is trained to attack, bite, and scratch in order to protect you or your valuables.When selecting a dog for protection, keep in mind that you don’t want an overtrained dog. A dog can be overtrained for your needs if it requires a level of discipline or knowledge in an owner beyond your abilities.
In addition, a dog that's received a lot of obedience training but hasn't trained specifically for protection services will hesitate and defer to its owner’s judgment in the event of an emergency. If your potential dog is actually trained for protection services, it will attend and respond to its surroundings more closely.
When you find a trainer or seller, ask them about how to maintain and care for a trained protection dog. A dog that’s been trained beyond your abilities may not be the most appropriate choice.

, Ask your local police and other law enforcement agencies about reputable trainers and sellers. Look for a local agency with K-9 dog units to provide you with recommendations.


Ask your local law enforcement office where their K-9 dogs are purchased or trained.
Ask them for local statistics or for a professional opinion regarding purchasing a dog for protection or a crime deterrent., Ask your local animal shelters and rescue groups if they can provide you with any specific information about local protection trainers or sellers. Ask for names of organizations or trainers in your area who specialize in training or selling personal protection dogs.


If no nearby shelters can provide you with a referral, ask them to put you in touch with a reputable trainer in your area.
Ask the trainer for a referral and for more information about how a protection dog can meet your specific needs.

, Hundreds of individuals and small businesses train and sell guard dogs, K-9 police dogs, and personal protection dogs. Search keyword phrases such as ""buy personal protection dog,"" ""personal protection dog for sale,"" or “retired police or military dogs.”


Make a list of your top returns, and check their websites for signs of credibility. Look for professionally designed websites and discard results that contain spelling or grammatical errors.
Look for trainers or sellers whose websites offer testimonials from past clients.
Find trainers who are certified with organizations such as the Animal Behaviorist Society or International Association of Canine Professionals. If their website offers any certifications, be sure to run a search on that organization.
Before contacting any prospective sellers, ask your local law enforcement or a local licensed trainer if they’ve heard of that seller.

, Discuss your specific needs with the prospective seller and make sure they can offer a dog that will provide adequate personal protection. The meaning of ""personal protection"" may vary from trainer to trainer, so be sure to ask about specific training methods and techniques. A dog trained only to bark, bite, and release might not fit your security needs.Ask the trainer or seller to perform a demonstration with the dog before purchasing.

, Since a personal protection dog can be an expensive investment, don’t buy from the first seller you find. Spend considerable time researching different sellers, and shop around for better prices.


Consider quality of training and the seller’s level of professionalism when you think about price differences.
Just because a trainer or seller markets their dogs as “elite” or “executive” doesn’t mean you should pay a higher price. These buzzwords are typically marketing ploys., Ask for detailed vaccination and veterinarian examination records. If you're buying from a breeder, make sure the dog's parents were screened for genetic disorders, parasites, and developmental disorders.Consider the dog's age, and be aware that the breeds recommended for protection live around 10 to 12 years on average.
Be aware of breed-specific conditions. For example, if you're buying a German Shepherd, consider hip problems. When the dog is in a standing position, check to see how much higher its shoulders are than its hips. If the hips are noticeably lower, ask for details about how well the dog moves and runs. Ask if it's ever been treated for hip problems, and ask for a vet exam before finalizing the purchase.
If the dog is a retired police or military dog, pay special care to look over its veterinary record for injuries or health conditions developed over time. Get a vet exam before finalizing the adoption or purchase, and ask your vet if the dog is healthy enough to offer effective protection.

, If you are not experienced with handling a personal protection dog, you will need training or resources in order to properly handle the dog. Ask the prospective seller what materials or classes they offer to help you become accustomed to caring for and handling the dog.Ask the seller if the dog will need ongoing training to provide personal protection.
If ongoing defense training is needed for the dog, determine the costs and frequency of the training upfront before purchasing the dog.

, Many rescue groups have an extensive placement process.They will require an application, an interview and a home visit to ensure a successful adoption. Some may even ask to consult your current veterinarian for information about you and previous pets.


If you don’t own your home, also be prepared to have a letter from your landlord stating that you are allowed to have a dog. While this may seem excessive to some people, the rescue group is attempting to place the dog with a family in a home that is prepared and willing to deal with the new responsibility of adding a family member. The rescue group does not want to add to the dog’s unrest with unsuccessful placements.
If you have an existing dog, that dog will need to be evaluated as well to make sure that the dogs will get along.

, Any puppy coming from a rescue should be fully checked by a veterinarian for basic health, parasites and vaccinations before they are adopted. Generally, they will be spayed or neutered before they go to their new homes or you will sign a contract to do so in the near future. Beware of any rescue group who skips these steps.

, Be sure that you understand the amount of work a puppy entails, as well as the extra work that a puppy with a rough past might require in order to train or socialize. Also be prepared for the extra love they will provide you!

You will need to consider whether you can afford normal daily costs, such as food, and long term expenses, such as vet bills. Be sure that you can work the cost into your budget comfortably before buying a puppy.;
, Settling your new puppy into your home and teaching it the ways of the world will take a lot of your time and patience. If you have a really busy schedule or a lot of travel coming up, you may want to wait until you have a lot of time to concentrate on your new puppy.


Taking the time to properly train a puppy will pay off in the future. A properly trained dog is a joy to have in your family, while a dog that is not trained could cause a lot of conflict and problems for years to come.

, You will need to puppy proof your home before you bring home your new bundle of joy. Make sure random items you don't want destroyed are put away and that all hazards are out of reach of the pup.


Pick a place in your home that will be all theirs for the near future. Don't let your puppy have the run of the place, instead give it a smaller space to adjust to before introducing it to the larger space. This will make the puppy's transition easier., German Shepherds are a great dog breed for active people who want to spend a lot of time with their dog.

The American Kennel Club (AKC) has listing for breeders and shows on their website in addition to the AKC breed standards., Getting a new puppy should not be done on a whim. This is a long term commitment that has associated costs. Consider the cost of buying a puppy from a breeder, veterinary care including basics such as vaccinations, flea, tick and heartworm prevention as well as spaying/neutering in your planning.

, It is a good idea to visit several local breeders before deciding who you want to buy your puppy from. Do not buy a puppy from the first breeder you visit.


You may want to expand your search outside your own local area in order to find the best breeder and puppy for your needs.

, Find out what they know about the care and breeding of Labrador puppies to measure their level of knowledge.


You should also ask if the breeder provides ongoing support if you need it, and if they will take the dog back if you can no longer keep it.
Buying a puppy from a breeder with all the documentation and parent testing does not guarantee a healthy puppy, unfortunately. However, buying a puppy without responsible breeding practices is highly likely to bring puppies into the world who have health issues that you (and the dog) will be paying for later.

, Get to know their personality a bit before you commit to paying to adopt them. If the breeder does not want you to meet the dog before you commit to buying it, that should be a warning sign that something is amiss.


Try playing with the puppy and see how it reacts to you. Your new puppy should have a good temperament. A well tempered puppy should not be overly aggressive or overly shy.

, Pay the breeder for the puppy and then take your new family member home! Remember to be gentle and calm with your new puppy. They will most likely be a little bit uncertain and scared when leaving the breeders home.


Assure that the breeder gives you all the paperwork they have for your dog.

Avoid adopting or buying a dog that is in ill health.,

Check the pedigree papers to see if there are a high number of titled dogs in the first and second generations. If a puppy's ancestor was titled, initials such as FC, JH, CH, CD, OTCH or WC will appear before or after the dog's name. Although most pedigree papers show three to five generations, the first two are of the most important. These titles show that the dog was able to meet minimum performance standards and is likely a well socialized, trainable dog. Higher level titles show exceptional intelligence, team work and trainability which should mean that offspring also have a higher likelihood of being smart and easy to train.

, If you are getting your dog from a breeder, ask to see the papers for the sire and dam of the litter.


Verify that both parents are at least 2 years old. Final hip clearances cannot be given before that age. Even if the dog had a hip clearance screening at a younger age, it is still possible for problems to develop that would prevent certification once the dog reached 2 years old. Check the parents' papers to make sure both dogs have hip certification from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals as well as registration from either the Canine Eye Registry Foundation or a current annual eye clearance from a veterinary ophthalmologist.

, Where will the puppies be born and raised? Will they get regular handling and socialization from a young age? What sorts of experiences will they encounter? At what age will they be allowed to go to their new homes? Puppies should never go to a new home until they are at least 8 weeks of age. In some states, like California, that is the law.


It's a good idea to see the puppy with its mother and litter mates. That way you know that the dog was not born in a puppy mill and that the breeder is actually breeding the dogs.

, Sold as Labrador Retrievers, cross-bred dogs or poorly-bred Labs are commonly found in pet stores. Quite often, pet stores get puppies from puppy mills who breed indiscriminately and without regard for the health or quality of the dogs. The breeding pairs, particularly the dams, are housed in poor conditions and the puppies rarely socialized.


Some states are cracking down on puppy mills and the pet stores that buy from them, but the practice is still quite common. Be forewarned that buying from a pet store encourages the puppy mill problem and increases the likelihood of problems for you later.
Some pet stores offer space to rescue groups for adoption events, this is a different situation entirely and should be encouraged.
Once again, it's best to see a puppy while it is still with its mother and litter mates. This will show you that the dog was not breed in a puppy mill or other horrible conditions.

, Even some local breeders will not allow you to visit and want to meet in a parking lot, or somewhere off site. This should be a red flag to stay away from this breeder.


Think first before considering having a puppy shipped. Shipping puppies is very stressful on them and often results in a sick puppy when you pick them up from the airport. A health guarantee does not actually guarantee against everything that might happen to the puppy, and, if your puppy is sick when you get it, what recourse do you have if the breeder is thousands of miles away?

, A healthy dog should be clean, well fed and energetic, with clear eyes, nose and ears. The puppy should have a nice hair coat without mats or fecal material and nails trimmed. Their appetite might be off a few days at first, but the puppy should be eating and drinking. No vomiting, no diarrhea should be present.

, There are people who do not breed the dogs themselves, but act as brokers for puppies. Getting dogs from various sources and advertising and selling the puppies to unsuspecting people is how they make money. Again, ask to visit the breeder’s location if you want to deal with a broker. If that is not possible, keep looking.

, Labrador retrievers are frequently bred and sold without papers through classified listings. This is a great way to find a cheap puppy that will need a lot of future health care, so start saving for vet bills now.


Similarly, don't adopt a puppy being sold by the box out front of a store. Impulse purchases are never a good idea. Remember that buying a sickly or sad looking puppy does not just save that puppy, it also funds further irresponsible breeding. It is not a good idea for you for supporting unethical breeding practices is not advised.

They are a highly adaptable breed and can be comfortable in a rural or urban setting. They do need daily exercise, however, usually in the form of a walk or a run.Golden Retrievers are good family dogs and do well with children. They also tend to be highly trainable and behave amicably with other pets. The one downside is they do not always do well when left along for long periods, so crate training may take extra time.Golden Retrievers are generally well behaved, but they do sometimes act out if they're not getting enough attention. As they are highly social, they need a lot of interaction to stay happy. If you work a lot and have a busy schedule, you may want to consider a different, more independent breed.;
, If you have your heart set on a puppy, you need to stop and consider the time commitment behind owning a young dog.


When you get a puppy, you will need to train him for basic behaviors like house breaking, leash manners, and crate training. This takes a great deal of time and patience, so make sure you have free time throughout the day to dedicate to training sessions.
Puppies also need more vet appointments during the first year for vaccinations. Even if your puppy has already certain shots, many vaccinations come in multiple rounds. Make sure you have the time and money for extra vet trips.
As puppies do not have as full an understanding of boundaries as adult dogs, you'll need to puppy-proof your house before bringing a puppy to your home. That means keeping food, breakable materials, and other items you do not want chewed on or soiled out of the puppy's reach until he's fully trained.

, While owning a puppy can be a fun experience, if you do not feel up to the commitment consider taking in an adult dog. Many people are hesitant to adopt if they want a specific breed, but there are Golden Retriever rescues across the country.


Rescues take in Golden Retrievers that have been abandoned by previous owners or rescued from bad pet stores and puppy mills and seek to find permanent homes. Qualifications for adoption vary between rescues, but the application process can be somewhat lengthy. However, the good news is adoption fees for rescued goldens are generally lower than for puppies from breeders.Many people want to go through a rescue for ethical reasons, but still want a puppy. While it is not impossible to secure a puppy through a rescue, it is not highly likely and there may be a very long wait. If you want a puppy, your best bet is to go through a reputable breeder. If you're dedicated to adopting through a rescue, open yourself up to adopting an older dog."

Contact one local dog rescue group for referral to other area groups. Some dog rescue groups work with all dogs, while others are breed-specific. Most rescues groups have established networks with other area rescues.
You can also visit the American German Shepherd Rescue Association website for referrals to German Shepherd rescue groups in your state or contact the American Kennel Club for referrals to German Shepherd Rescue Groups. The organization's website also provides links to rescue organizations.

, Although the majority of dogs looking for new homes through rescue groups are adults, sometimes rescue groups have puppies to place.


Most German Shepherds looking for homes through rescue groups do not have papers. If registering your puppy is important, or if you intend to enter it into competitions, you will need its title papers and health records, so a rescued dog may not be right for you.

, Many dog rescues will require a thorough application process in order to assure that you will be a good fit for the dog. Be prepared to disclose your address and whether you own your home, as well as your employment status and your philosophy when it comes to raising a dog.

, You will want to make sure that the dog's temperament works well with you and your family.


Ask whether you can get the dog checked out by your veterinarian. You will want your vet to check the dog's general health and for serious conditions, such as heart murmurs.

, Be sure to ask about the dog's health while the rescue has had it and if it is up to date on shots and healthcare. A good rescue should actually offer up this information up front.


Get a history of the dog's healthcare up to that point. Has it had its first vaccination, had heart worm treatment, and parasite control? These should have all been done before the age when a puppy is adoptable.
While many rescue organizations cannot tell you much about the dogs they place, because the dogs have been rescued off the street or they have been given up anonymously, sometimes they have a bit of information. Get all the information you can about the dog's past so that you can assess their general background and health.

, Dog rescue organizations are usually run on a shoe-string budget. While they depend mostly on volunteers, they do need funds to transport and care for dogs. Your adoption fee will most likely help to pay for the rescue of other dogs in the future.

Look for breeders who participate with their dogs in activities that demonstrate the dogs' abilities. Such activities include Schutzhund, the working breed test for German Shepherds, and dog shows.

, Avoid breeders who keep the dogs in cages away from people and have multiple litters at the same time. These puppies often do not receive the early stimulation necessary for development.

, This includes certification that the dogs do not carry a predisposition for hip or elbow dysplasia, eye disorders, cardiac disease, or Von Willebrand's disease (or VWD).

, Although some breeders do sell puppies on the Internet, you should always visit the breeder in person and see the puppy before deciding to buy it.


If a litter is not currently available, ask if you can visit with a breeder's adult dogs. Notice the adult dogs' physical appearance. The size, build and coloring of the breeding pair is a good indication of how future puppies will look. An adult male German shepherd should stand 24 to 26 inches (60 to 66 cm) at the top of his shoulder blades. A female should stand 22 to 24 inches (55 to 60 cm). If you like what you see and feel comfortable with the breeder, request to be contacted when a litter is being offered for sale.

Before you get yourself into this undertaking, you should think about your schedule and if you have time for a puppy. Your puppy will also take time to learn new commands, so be patient with him as he learns.


Your puppy will not know how to be well-behave naturally. However, he will want to please you, which will help you when you train him.
Potty training can take anywhere from four to six months to a year. ;
, Your puppy can begin to be potty trained when he is around 12 to 16 weeks old. At this point, his bladder is developed enough that he can learn to hold it. , Once you bring your new puppy home, you need to take him outside immediately to show him where he needs to go to the bathroom. This will help him start associating being outside with going to the bathroom. Once he does, give him lots of praise and affection, which will link praise with going to the potty outside.


When he goes out, let him sniff and explore the yard until he goes to the bathroom. , When your puppy is first potty training, you need to make sure he is confined to one general area when you aren't home or watching him. This will cut down on accidents in other parts of the house while he learns.


Common places are washrooms and bathrooms., Your puppy will show signs that he needs to go out. Look for signs of panting, pacing, sniffing around, or barking. These are all signs that he needs to go to the bathroom. When these signs appear, take him outside right away so he can do his business.

, When your puppy is learning, you need to take him out often. Take him out right when he gets up and every 30 minutes to an hour throughout the day. Take him out right after feeding and when he wakes up from a nap. He should also go out right before he goes to bed.


Try to take him to the same spot in the yard every time you take him out. His scent there will prompt him to go to the bathroom.
His size may play a role in the timing of when he goes out as he ages. If your dog is small, he has a smaller bladder and will need to go to the bathroom more, even when he is grown. This may make it seem like he can't hold it, but he is just smaller., When your puppy goes out and uses the bathroom, give him a lot of praise. You can even go overboard with how much you praise him. It will only make him want to please you more. You can even give him a treat every couple of times you take him out.


Never wipe his nose in it if he has an accident in the house. This is cruel and will not teach him anything., Crate training is a great thing for your dog. You can put him in there when you aren't home, which will cut down on accidents in the house. It will also allow him a place to escape to when he is overwhelmed by everything or just needs to be alone. Since he will be spending significant time in his crate, you need to make sure you buy one large enough for your puppy.


His crate, also known as a kennel, should be large enough that he can stand up, turn around, and comfortably lay down in. It should also have plenty of room to fit him as he grows., When you are first crate training your dog, you need to make it a comfortable and happy place for him. Start out with the crate open in your living room or kitchen where you are. Place a blanket, small bed, or crate pad in the crate to make him want to go in.


You can also toss in a treat to encourage him inside., Once you send your dog into the crate with the door open for a few times, start shutting the door while he is in there. Leave the door closed for about 10 minutes.


You should not let him out if he is still whining or scratching at the door of the cage. This will show him that this behavior will get him out of the cage., Over time, you should increase the amount of time you leave your puppy in the crate. Keep increasing the time he spends in the crate until he can stay in the crate for long periods of time without whining or pawing at the door.


This will vary depending on how old your puppy is. If he is under four months old, the time he needs to stay is two hours. If he is older than four months old, he needs to stay in there four hours without whining, as long as their bladders can hold it that long.
Never leave a dog in a crate for longer than this, unless he stays in his crate while you are at work. Never use the crate as a punishment because he will start seeing it as a scary place., If you have other dogs or cats in your home, you need to take your time introducing your new puppy to them. When you first bring your puppy home, keep him separate from your other animals. For their first meeting, find neutral territory, such as a neighbor's yard, a park, or other open space. There also needs to be a fence or other open but restricted barrier there so you can keep the animals apart.


Put a leash on all the animals and then put your new puppy on one side of the fence and your other animals on the other. Let them sniff each other through the barrier for around 30 minutes.
The next day, take them back to a neutral location and let them meet without the barrier. This area needs to be open so they won't feel confined and will have plenty of room to sniff each other. Wait around two minutes while they sniff each other, letting them get used to each other. Watch them carefully for any aggressive behavior or fighting. After the initial sniffing, let them play for a few minutes, then take them back home.
After this, let them together in your backyard, then in your house. For the first few weeks, don't leave them alone together in the house. Wait until you know they are familiar enough with each other until you do that., In order for your dog to be well adjusted, you need to get him acclimated to household noises and activity and other people. This will help him get used to them while he is still growing, which will help him not react badly to them as he grows.


You should do this in a non-threatening manner. Don't scare him with things, such as chasing him with a vacuum or hitting at him with a broom. Just go about your daily business so he gets used to it.
Slowly introduce him to the other animals in the house as he grows so he gets used to them.
Make sure any visitors you have over are introduced to your puppy so he learns to like new people., In order for your puppy to get used to being in the car, you should take him for a lot car rides. This will get him used to other vehicles on the road and the noises of the drive.


This will also help him be easier to travel with and easier to take to the vet., Dog parks are great places for your dog to be socialized with other dogs as well as humans. When you go to the dog park, make sure your puppy is on a leash. You don't want him to run away or get in trouble with other dogs.


Make sure your puppy has had his first two distemper vaccinations before you take him to the park.
Only let your dog off the leash if he likes other dogs and humans, if he has learned to stay near you, and if he listens to commands., Once your dog is a little older, you can start taking him to obedience classes. These are given by pet stores, community centers, or pet shops. These classes will help you learn along with your dog how to get him to obey you and be a well-behaved dog.


If you can't find any classes you like, ask you vet., Training your dog with voice commands will help him be a better and well-behaved dog throughout his life. When you are first start training him, keep the sessions short, around five minutes. You should also start with one command at a time until he learns it. Then move on to another command.


Repeat these sessions three times a day as you are training him.
You can increase the time of these sessions as he gets older.

, The first lesson that your puppy should learn is 'no' or 'stop'. It will be easier for your to pick one or the other, since they basically mean the same thing and your dog will not know the meaning until you teach him. Make sure you are always firm with this command, though you should never hit him.


When you see your puppy doing something he shouldn't, tell him 'no' or 'stop'. Then pull him away from the activity and tell him again.
Keep repeating this command every time he does something he isn't supposed to until he obeys you consistently., Your puppy with start to explore the things around him through his mouth. This means that he will try to chew and bite everything. When you are playing with you puppy and he goes to bite or chew on you, tell him 'no bite'. After you say this, give him a chew toy to chew on instead. This will help him associate this behavior with the toys instead of your fingers.


Do the same thing if you find him chewing objects he shouldn't, such as shoes or furniture, by saying 'no chew'.
Repeat until he does this consistently., One helpful command to teach your puppy is 'sit'. To start off, stand in front of your puppy with a treat in your hand that he can see. Firmly tell him to 'sit', then push his bottom down until he is sitting. Once he is there, give him the treat and praise him.


Turn away from your puppy and let him stand back up. Then, turn back to him and tell him to sit. If he doesn't, repeat the command and push his bottom down gently. Keep doing this until he can do it on his own without your help consistently.
This command works well to stop her from jumping as well. Use a leash or your hands to gently pull him back, then give him the sit command and a tasty treat when he complies. He will soon learn that he shouldn't jump., Once he has mastered many of the other commands, you can teach your dog to lay down. You can either say 'down' or 'lay down' for this command. To start, stand or sit facing your dog with a treat in your hand he can see. Tell him 'down' or 'lay down' as you move your hand with the treat down towards the floor. As he starts to lay down, even if it is only a little bit, give him the treat and praise him.


Keep trying until he lies down completely on the floor consistently., The 'stay' command is one of the best to help with your puppy's safety. When your puppy is sitting in front of you, hold your hand in front of his face as wide as you can and firmly say 'stay'. Start backing away slowly. If he starts coming towards you, command him to sit again and give him praise. Then repeat the process until he stays on his own, then praise him and give him a treat.


Keep doing this until he learns to stay all the time, even if you go far away and tell him to 'stay'., Another command that can help your dog stay safe is 'come'. Start out slow while you are playing in the yard. Lean down and slap your thighs, saying 'come' in a friendly voice. He will think you want to play, so he will come running to you. Give him a treat a praise.


Repeat this command at different times, especially when your puppy may be distracted by a toy, another dog, or another human. Repeat the command and praise him when he comes to you.
You can also try using one of his favorite toys to entice him to you in the beginning., This command helps you stop your dog from barking at the wrong times. Keep a bag of treats handy for when he starts barking. When he does, look at him with a treat in your hand and say 'quiet'. As soon as he stops barking, give him the treat and praise.


If he doesn't stop right away, show him the treat to try to get him to stop. Then repeat until he stops as soon as you say the command., As your dog ages, make sure to keep his training steady. Even after he learns all the commands, play with him and call out random commands. When he does as he is told, give him praise and treats. This will keep him sharp and make him a better, more well-behaved dog as he ages.

Stay away from pet stores and puppy mills.,
Familiarize yourself with the qualities of a good breeder.,
Contact a breeder in your area.",How to Buy a Golden Retriever Puppy2," Breeders and puppy mills are appealing to many because they can provide puppies quickly and with less applications and sometimes less cost. However, there are many, many downsides to adopting through a puppy mill or pet store.


Puppies from pet stores and mills are usually poorly bred, meaning they're prone to more health problems down the road. As they're usually kept in poor conditions before being sold, they usually already have certain behavioral problems at the time of purchase.Pet shop breeders also rely heavily on impulse buys. This is part of the reason it's so easy to get a puppy from a pet store. However, the practice is ethically questionable as it results in many dogs being returned or abandoned at shelters. Buying from a pet store puts money towards such practices that would be betters spent on responsible breeders.While not as bad as a pet store, backyard breeders are also not a good choice. Backyard breeder refers to someone who owns a Golden Retriever and casually decided to breed her for fun. Usually, such owners do not understand how to care for puppies or how to breed responsibly, in a way that minimizes the risk of genetic disorders., When selecting puppy breeders, learn the qualities of a good breeder so you can select someone responsible who will provide with a healthy puppy.


Good breeders will belong to organizations like the American Kennel Club, the Golden Retriever Club of America, or a local Golden Retriever club.A good breeder will also be involved in showing in agility competitions, hunting shows, tracking, or in any combination of fields. A good breeder is dedicated to networking with other dog enthusiasts to keep a long line of healthy dogs coming for generations.A good breeder will keep his dogs in a clean facility. Puppies should be relatively well socialized with clean, glossy coats. They should be excited to see visitors and not behave fearfully or whimper. A good breeder will also never offer to sell a puppy under seven weeks as this can be emotionally difficult for that puppy and lead to behavioral issues.A good breeder will provide extensive medical records, including dates, of any vaccinations, exams, and dewormings. He will also provide an pedigree for both parents, including information on any hereditary disorders in your puppy's bloodline. Ideally, a good breeder will have had both parents tested for a number of diseases commonly found in Golden Retrievers.A good breeder will not sell his puppies to just anyone. He will want to go over conditions for care and instructions for feeding and training your new puppy. He will also probably ask you a lot of questions about your experience owning dogs and your interest in Golden Retrievers specifically. While many people feel confused when breeders ask a lot of questions, this is a good sign. This means the breeder is dedicated to finding the best possible homes for his puppies, which means he's dedicated to the ethical care and treatment of animals., Understanding how to spot a good breeder, start looking for breeders in your area.


The American Kennel Club website has a great search engine to locate local breeders. This is an excellent place to start. You can also go through the Golden Retriever Club of America or any local organizations you know of.You can also check at local vet clinics and ask anyone you know who owns a Golden Retriever.
You may have to travel, especially if you live in a rural area. The closest breeder may be a few hours outside of town, so make sure you're prepared to make a few long visits to meet and select a puppy.

Discuss what type of dog you want with the breeder.,
Ask to see the health records of the parents.,
Meet the puppies as a group.,
Interact with the puppies one on one.,
Watch for signs of good health.",How to Buy a Golden Retriever Puppy3," A good breeder will want to work with you to find the right dog for you. Explain the qualities you're looking for in a dog and ask the breeder to help you select the right puppy.


Oftentimes, breeders will not let you pick from the whole litter. They may narrow down your search to 2 or 3 puppies that meet your qualifications and have you choose from them.The breeder will ask you a lot of questions while you explain what you want. Once again, this is a good thing. A quality breeder wants to make sure his puppies are matched in good homes and won't end up in shelters down the road., You should also ask for the health records of the parents of any litter. Golden Retrievers are generally healthy, but there are a few concerns that are inheritable you should watch for.


Cancer is a major killer for Golden Retrievers, but seeing cancer in your puppy's lineage is not necessarily a red flag. It is unknown whether cancer in goldens is genetic and, as over half of all goldens eventually get cancer, it may unfortunately be an inevitable part of owning the breed.Hip dysplasia, however, is a genetic disease and can be very painful for your dog and costly to treat. Make sure your retrievers parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and get regular hip x-rays to make sure the disease is not developing.Heart disease is also common in goldens, and can lead to unexpected deaths when your puppy is still young. Heart disease is not always inherited however, but you should still watch for it in your puppy's pedigree. While you might still choose to adopt the puppy if he has a family history of heart disease, you should talk to your vet about periodic chest x-rays to monitor him for the condition., You should observe how puppies behave in a group to select the best puppy for you.


The puppy you select should be social. He should engage with his litter mates without behaving in an overly aggressive, overly alpha way.See how the puppy responds to moving objects. You want a puppy that's smart and active, so make sure he has at least some instinct to follow and chase any balls. You also want a puppy that shares toys, one that will now fight with other pets over a rope, ball, or chew toy., You can learn a lot about puppies based on how they behave during one-on-one interactions.


You want a puppy that's not shy when separated from its litter mates. Puppies should be curious about new surroundings at 7 to 8 weeks, and should explore the territory while occasionally interacting with you.Make sure the puppy is relatively well behaved. A puppy that's too bold and is constantly getting into things might be more commitment than you're ready for.A puppy that seems shy when separated from its litter may not be a good option. That puppy may develop behavioral issues down the road., Make sure the puppy you choose is in good health. You do not want to adopt a puppy with any signs of disease.


Healthy puppies should be energetic with glossy coats and clear eyes.Closely examine the puppy's eyelid and eyelashes, as certain hereditary disorders are marked by drainage from the eyes.Never adopt a Golden Retriever if the breeder does not offer a health clearance or health papers. A reputable breeder will want to keep you informed of any possible health conditions or genetic disorders your puppy may experience to assure that you're prepare for the commitment and the dog will not end up abandoned later in life.Pay attention to ear size. Some goldens have floppier ears than others. While this is not necessarily a red flag, be aware a floppy-eared dog may be prone to ear infections, especially if you allow him to swim."

Know the temperament of both the breed and the individual dog that you want.,
Choose a dog breed that you have the time and money for.,
Show the dog that you are dominant, especially if it is not a very submissive dog.",How to Buy a Dog That Suits You," Observe your house and yard. Will the dog be an outdoor dog or an indoor dog? Make sure your yard or house is big enough for them to live in, whether they are an outdoor dog or an indoor dog. Even a small dog such as a Dachshund will need a lot of space.;
, If you are busy, you should get a low maintenance dog, such as an older beagle. If not, you could try getting a medium or high maintenance dog such as a poodle puppy. You also need to be able to afford the dog's food, water, toys, crate, veterinary care, grooming, etc.

, Your dog should not become dominant over you or it will create a lot of problem behavior. You need to emit a sense of authority over your dog.

Kneel to the dog’s level.,
Let the dog come to you.,
Feed the dog by hand.",How to Build a Relationship With a Dog1," When approaching a dog, always do so from the side and not from the front, which can seem aggressive. Get down to their level and face the same direction as them- this will prevent them from seeing you as confrontational. Avoid eye contact and let the dog get comfortable with having you in its space.When showing affection, kneeling to be at the same height as your dog demonstrates trust, equality, and connection., To ear a dog's trust, always respect its space and let it come to you. Avoid petting a dog without it sniffing your hand or prompting you first; if the dog gives you such a cue, pet its chest, and avoid petting it at any angle from above. Prioritize the dog’s comfort and move slowly., A good way to earn a dog’s trust is to feed it by hand. Crouch to the dog’s level and place its food in the palm of your hand, holding it out while avoiding eye contact. The bonding exercise of feeding a dog in this way will build its trust in you, as a caring provider.If the dog is too afraid to eat from your hand, start by placing the food in front of it and slowly work up to having the dog eat out of your hand.

Ask local shelters if they will allow you to adopt multiple dogs at once.,
Avoid adopting two or more puppies at the same time.,
Be sure that you can afford multiple dogs.,
Make sure you can devote time to training.,
Talk with the people in your life.",How to Adopt Multiple Dogs at One Time1," Most shelters and rescue groups will not allow you to adopt multiple dogs at one time.Some shelters may allow you to adopt a bonded pair. However, you will likely need to demonstrate that you have the time and resources to care for two dogs simultaneously.After adopting your first dog, many shelters will allow you to adopt another dog in one month. Because adopting one dog can be difficult, most shelters will help you adopt a second dog once the first has successfully adjusted to your home and family.Check with your local shelters and rescue groups about their adoption policies. Ask things like “Do you allow people to adopt multiple dogs?” and “What are your policies regarding bonded pairs?”;
, Puppies, even if they are from different litters, have a tendency to form very close bonds with each other, often failing to build relationships with their owners. This makes it very difficult to properly train the puppies and socialize them. Unless you are willing to spend a significant amount of time training the puppies, the result is often an unruly pair of puppies that do not recognize your or members of your family as the alphas of the pack.Ideally, you should adopt one puppy and, once it is trained and socialized to your family, adopt another dog.

, The ASPCA estimates that caring for one dog can cost anywhere from $500 - $1,000 each year depending on its size and health.You will need to multiply that cost by each dog that you adopt. Dogs are particularly expensive in the first year when you are purchasing new toys, bedding, food, and paying for any health expenses. Look at your finances and, if you cannot afford to pay at least $1,000 a year in dog-related expenses, you should avoid adopting multiple dogs.A responsible shelter or rescue group will ask questions about your finances during the application process. If they feel that you are unable to take care of multiple dogs, they will deny your application or ask you to adopt only one dog.

, Multiple dogs will take a considerable amount of time, particularly if you adopt multiple puppies. Adult dogs may need less training. However, you will spend considerable time and resources adjusting them to your home and each other. Puppies are even more problematic because you will need to train them separately. With two puppies alone, you will double the amount of time spent simply training them. Unless you are capable and willing to spend multiple hours each day training and caring for your dogs, you should consider only adopting one animal., Before you adopt multiple dogs, talk with your family members and roommates about your decision. Bringing multiple dogs into your home will initially be a little hectic as the animals adjust. They may be extremely noisy and make multiple messes. Explain the situation and find out if everyone that you live with is okay with multiple new dogs being in your home.Be sure to check with your landlord about whether or not pets are allowed in your building. If they are allowed, you should also find out how many you can have. Depending on where you live, they may also have the right to increase your security deposit.

Make sure your dog is calm and submissive before you give it anything.",How to Raise a Balanced Puppy," If you plan to get a puppy, ask yourself and your family some questions. Are you all ready to make a commitment? Puppies are a lot of work to train properly. There is housetraining, giving them exercise, teaching them manners, and how to get along with other animals and humans.During the first six months of a puppy’s life it needs constant attention to make it into a great adult dog that is a joy to be around.
Do you have enough time on your hands for a dog? Will someone be home most of the day during these first six months to take the puppy out for potty and play breaks every couple of hours? If not, rethink bringing a puppy into your home. Remember, taking care of a young puppy is a full-time job.
Consider adopting a older dog instead of a puppy if you don't have enough time to commit to a puppy. Older dogs, while taking some time to incorporate into the family, do not take the 24 hour care that a new puppy does.;
, It cannot be stressed enough how important regular daily exercise is to a young puppy. It's the best way to keep your dog calm and it allows you to bond with your dog at the same time. You don't want a puppy bounding all around the house because it doesn't get enough exercise. While there aren’t any hard and fast rules as to amount of exercise here are some guidelines:


Puppies younger than two months of age can get their exercise running around the house. From two to three months of age they should have 4-5 short play sessions or walks (around 10 minutes) outside a day. From three to four months this can be increased to 15 minutes. From four to six months they can have 20 minutes of exercise three times a day. After six months the time can gradually be increased. This is all “structured” play time with family members—they will fill in the rest of their time with play with toys, etc.There are many ways you can give your dog the exercise that it needs. You can play ball with it in your backyard or at a dog park. If you like to go for morning runs, your adult dog (older than 18 months) can come with you.
Keep in mind that running or jogging for sustained time (longer than 20 minutes) is too much for dogs under 18 months, as their joints and bones are still forming.Walking two or three (or more) times a day is a better option for young (and elderly) dogs.
Depending on your puppy's breed, size, and age, the amount of exercise needed will vary.
Lack of exercise could lead to aggression later on in the dog's life when it takes its frustration out in negative ways. A bored dog can be a destructive dog and pick up bad habits right away.

, You should strive to form a strong bond of love and affection between you and your dog.Your bond will strengthen the relationship and it will help your puppy or dog be happier and balanced.


Give your dog as much affection and love as you want! The love you give your dog, and the love you receive in return, is the best part of having a dog.
Give your dog affection and love consistently, but do not reward it with praise or affection if it does something that it is not supposed to do. Instead, give it lavishly when it performs a desired behavior. Even a small step in the right direction deserves praise.A little food reward immediately after the desired behavior will also work wonders in reinforcing good behavior and a strong bond., Dogs are great to have and they love and deserve a calm, assertive human to play with. Remember, your dog won't be a puppy forever, so while it is make the most of it!


Get your family involved. They are part of the “pack” in your puppy’s mind. Make sure that all members of the family play with the puppy. You could even have a set time every day when the whole family plays with the pup.

, You will need to enforce some strong rules with your puppy and you must be consistent all the time when disciplining it. For example, if your dog likes to jump up on you, just push it off, say NO, and walk away. In time, your dog will get the message and won't continue to jump on people.


Under no circumstances strike a dog. Doing so will make it resentful of you and may escalate into aggressive (defensive) behavior on your dog’s part .There are any number of bad habits a dog may acquire over a lifetime. These include digging in the yard, barking excessively, begging at the table, counter surfing for food, or destroying things. Do your best to break it of these habits as soon as they crop up.

, Dogs need to learn the family rules, just like any other family member. Unfortunately, human and dog communication can be a difficult thing to understand. Positive reinforcement of good behavior usually works better than trying to dissuade a pup from doing bad things.


Many times giving the dog an alternative (such as a special digging spot, a toy or a treat in place of whatever he is chewing on) activity will curb a bad habit.The key is consistency and patience as the dog learns the new, healthier “habit.”

, You can show your puppy or dog that you’re in charge without being a bully, mean or cruel. This isn’t done by hitting or screaming at your dog. This is by demonstrating calm, assertive behavior, which is different from aggressive behavior.If you don’t assert your authority the pup will see the position of leader as unfilled and it will try to take charge by instinct.
How do you make sure you're in charge? Act like a confident person; even if you aren’t, it will come with practice. Give off the energy that you are confident; stand tall; take deep, regular breaths; talk in a calm, yet sincere manner.Your puppy or dog will intuitive sense that calm and confident manner and want to please you, its pack leader, and it will follow your lead.

, That way, it will learn that the only way it gets what it needs is by being calm and submissive. You'll know when your dog is calm and submissive. Its ears will be back, tail down low and wagging, and its body will be relaxed.


There's a difference between scared and submissive. If your dog is scared, its ears will be laid far back, its tail will be between its legs, and it will sometimes cower or shake or be just plain tense.

Choose your Greyhound.,
Once you have chosen the perfect dog for you, you will need to introduce him or her to your home gradually and calmly.,
Take them out and about.,
Help them create a healthy sleep routine.,
Keep them in good medical health.,The rest is down to the owner, look after your new pal well and have fun living your life with your dog, don't and vets bills and other terrible things can pop up

",How to Be a Great Greyhound Pet Owner," Puppies are lots of work and if this is your first sighthound or even your first dog, consider adopting a retired racer. They are a very adaptable breed so when you bring the dog home it will be a blank slate.;
,


Keep the Greyhound on the lead and take him or her around the house. If you have glass doors, it's advised you tap the glass and let the dog (still on the lead) touch the glass with his or hers nose so they know not to run into it.
Then let your new dog loose and don't make a big fuss because it could make the dog nervous.
Let him or her sniff the dog bed and let them explore, if they want to go to you they can but don't go to them because they're still a bit nervous.
After they've had a good look around let them out in the designated area and let them go to the loo, praise them and give them a treat for doing so.

, For the first few days out and about, it's recommended that your new Greyhound wears a muzzle so he cannot nip at any other dogs or wild rabbits.




Greyhounds are not aggressive dogs and are the complete opposite, they are calm and affectionate. But because of their prey drive from racing, they can take off after wild rabbits or any other small animals.
Greyhounds could nip other dogs in an act of self defence. In kennels, they're normally used to other Greyhounds for kennel mates but if another smaller dog of a different breed or a bigger dog runs up to the Greyhound without it being in his or hers eyesight it could spook your dog. If the other dog nips back, it could be fatal because Greyhounds' flesh is very thin.



, This is probably one of the first nights ever for your dog to be alone, let him or her get settled 10-20 minutes before you go to sleep. For the first couple of nights, it would be better to keep a light on or a radio turned down so he or she does not feel alone. Your dog will soon realise that it's also their kennel as well as your home and will sleep like a log!

, It's very important to keep your Greyhounds health in good shape.


Groom him or her regularly and using a special dog toothbrush and toothpaste (Do not use human toothpaste. It's poisonous to dogs.) Brush their teeth once a week. It's very important, because Greyhounds do not drool. They keep all the saliva in their mouths which can quicken tar build up on the teeth and gums.
It's also important to clean the dogs ears and clip their claws to make sure they're in no pain and can live life to the fullest.

Purchase an overhead harness.,
Have your dog sit and stay.,
Let the harness hang loose in your hands.,
Slide your dog’s head through the neck piece.,
Arrange the bottom straps.,
Snap the strap buckles together.,
Adjust the harness to fit your dog.",How to Put on a Puppy Harness1," An overhead harness fits over your dog’s head and has straps or tabs that adjust to fit around her belly. Some overhead harnesses also come with chest protection to prevent rubbing and added safety features like reflective trim and a car seat restraint loop.Look online for an overhead harness, or at your local pet store.
You will need to measure your pup’s girth or belly area and her neck area to determine her size.
Alternatively, you could also take your dog with you when you go shopping for a harness and have your pup try the harness on before you buy it. To confirm the harness fits your dog properly, make sure you can fit at least two fingers between the harness and your dog's body at all points, including her belly and her neck.
Note that most harnesses are not adequate restraints in a motor vehicle. Do not use a regular harness as a seat belt /restraint unless it specifically says on the packaging that it is designed for this purpose.;
, This will keep her from moving around while you attach the harness. You may also need to ask a friend or partner to hold your dog to keep her still.


Keep some treats around to reward her once you put on the harness., This will help you identify the neck part of the harness. Reassure your pup with a few pets.

, The neck piece will be the large round hole in the middle of the harness. It should be large enough for you to slide it over your dog’s head without squeezing or pulling on her ears or face.


If it is too small to slide over her head, the harness may be too small for her neck.

, Slide the straps between your pup's two front legs. The straps should sit between her two front legs, under her belly. They should fit snugly, but not be too short or too tight around your pup’s legs. If the straps don't reach around your pups' belly, they are likely too short and the harness may be too small for her.

, Reach around your dog's legs and secure the buckles on either side of the harness together. The straps should wrap around your dog's upper belly area.


Depending on the type of strap buckles your harness has, you may need to simply slide the two pieces together or push one piece through the other piece to secure the buckles.

, Step back and look at your dog in the harness. Does it look like it is pinching or squeezing her? Does it hang too low on her body? Use the adjustment points, or clips that are attached to the straps, to adjust the harness so it fits her properly.


It should be snug but also loose enough for you to fit two fingers comfortably between your dog and the harness at any point.
Test the fit of the harness before you attach the leash to the harness and give your pup a treat for a job well done.

Introduce basic obedience commands.,
Expand the obedience training.,
Employ low-stress negative reinforcement.,
Be consistent.",How to Build a Relationship With a Dog2," Choose a spot that your dog is familiar with, and that has very few distractions, to start training.Start with short, fifteen minute sessions to avoid overwhelming the dog. Illustrate commands with gestures and reward your dog's success at following commands with praise, treats, and other positive reinforcement., Once your dog is skilled at a few basic obedience commands (e.g. ""sit"", ""stay"" and ""lie down""), practice these commands in areas with more distractions. This may seem repetitive or unnecessary, but it is an important step to ensure that your dog understands these commands beyond the environment it learned them in. For obedience training that is environment-specific (i.e. staying seated in the car), it is important to practice with your dog in that specific context., Discouraging bad behavior is important, but it is more important to avoid instilling fear or distrust in a dog. Avoid any measures that use intimidation or harm to get a dog to behave (e.g. hitting it, dragging it by the leash, using a shock collar).To convey your disapproval, use a strong, firm tone of voice and employ low-stress negative reinforcement - as a punishment, take something away from your dog, like a treat or toy. Dogs naturally seek guidance, which is better conveyed by confident leadership than by aggressive reinforcement., Dogs learn through the repeated process of commands and consequences, so it is important to stay consistent on this front. Commands, non-verbal communication, and rewards should stay the same to create a foundation of trust and obedience. Always be as clear and direct as possible, and try to establish a regular schedule and procedure for training, eating, grooming, and so on."

Play with the dog regularly.,
Pet the dog regularly.,
Walk your dog in areas that it prefers.,
Respect your dog's dislikes.",How to Build a Relationship With a Dog3," With humans and dogs alike, having fun together builds friendship and loyalty. Make a point of playing with the dog on a regular basis and, in turn, build up the positive associations it has with you. Some fun games or activities to try are:


playing fetch, a classic game that builds a dog’s sense of purpose
hide and seek, a game fueled by a dog’s desire to find you (a reflection on its bond with you)

, Once a dog has accepted your petting and shown you affection, it is important to show it affection regularly to keep up the bond. Given the largely non-verbal nature of the human-dog relationship, physical interaction plays a huge role in bonding. Petting and grooming are affectionate ways to show a dog how important it is to you, and are thought to reduce stress in dogs and humans alike., Observe your dog's preferences for particular environments; for instance, your dog may seem especially energetic and playful during walks in the park, but sullen and lethargic during walks on busy, city streets. Be mindful and considerate of these preferences and accommodate the dog accordingly. Choosing to walk your dog in areas it feels most comfortable in will result in a happier pet and better bonding time for the two of you., If your dog expresses a clear dislike for something (by whining, crying, fidgeting, or barking), avoid it in the future if possible. For example, if you dress your dog in a costume or unnecessary clothing and it expresses clear discomfort, don't do it again. Showing respect for its comfort and preferences will show that you can keep your dog happy, and strengthen its trust in you."
"
Look for a bonded pair.,
Interact with the dogs.,
Get the pair’s history.",How to Adopt Multiple Dogs at One Time2," One of the few occasions under which a shelter or rescue may let you adopt multiple dogs is if they are a bonded pair. This means that the dogs have become closely bonded and separating them would cause significant mental anguish for at least one of the animals, resulting in severe behavioral issues. Shelters will often advertise bonded pairs, preferring to keep them together.You can check online or call your local shelters rescue groups to find out if they have any bonded pairs.


A bonded pair usually consists of an alpha and a beta dog. Individually, alphas can often be placed in a new home with little problem. However, betas can struggle with the separation and experience behavioral problems.

, After narrowing your search down to a few pairs that you are interested in, you should visit the dogs at the kennel. Take them for a short walk and play with them. This will help you get a feel for their personalities and determine whether they will be a good fit.Be sure to bring along your family members or any additional pets that you own to make sure that everyone will get along nicely.

, Be sure to talk with the staff of the shelter or rescue group about the pair’s history and their temperament. It is important to know if the dogs suffered any trauma or abuse in their previous home. You should also talk with the pair’s previous veterinarian to determine if there are any health problems that you should know about. .Ask the staff things like “How does the pair behave when separated?” and “How long have these two dogs been together?”
Ask the veterinarian questions like “Are the dogs up-to-date on their vaccinations?” and “Does either dog have any major health problems?”

"
"
Apply for adoption.,
Sleep on it.,
Adopt the dogs.",How to Adopt Multiple Dogs at One Time3," Once you have decided on a pair of dogs to adopt, the shelter or rescue group will have you complete an adoption application. This typically involves answering a number of questions about your income, home, employment history, and veterinarian. Because adopting a pair requires a significant investment of time and resources, the vetting process may be more thorough. Do not be surprised if the organization denies your application to adopt multiple dogs. Each organization has its own requirements and adoption process.

, If the shelter or rescue group approves your adoption, you should take 24-hours and think things over. Determine whether you are dedicated to caring for a pair of new dogs. Talk it out with your friends and family.Remember that dogs that are adopted and returned to the kennel suffer significant emotional and mental trauma. This manifests as behavioral problems that make it more difficult for the dogs to get adopted later on.

, If you decide that you still want to move forward with the adoption, you will need to complete some paperwork and pay the organization’s fees. The paperwork often gives the medical history of the individual dogs and documents your agreement to care for the animals. The fees pay for any licensing and help cover the expenses of the organization running the kennel.The fee can run anywhere from $20 to over $100 per dog. The adoption fee for rescue groups is often higher, ranging between $150 and $400 each.

Create a space for your dogs.,
Take them to the veterinarian.,
Train the dogs separately.,
Walk and play with the dogs separately.",How to Adopt Multiple Dogs at One Time4," If you are bringing home a bonded pair, you will need to create a quite space for the two dogs. Place their bedding, food, and other necessities in a part of your house that is peaceful, yet frequently accessed by members of your household. If you are bring home two new puppies, you will need to give each of them their own space, bedding, food, and toys. This prevents them bonding too closely with each other.Avoid having any large social events in the first few weeks after your bring your new pets home.
Ask your roommates or family members to keep it quiet while the new dogs adjust to your home.

, After your pets have had a few days to adjust to your home, you should take them to see your veterinarian. Your vet will want to make sure that they are up-to-date on their shots and that they are in good health. Depending on the age of your dogs, your veterinarian may have tips on how to care for them as well., If you are bringing home a pair of puppies, you will need to do all of their training individually. This includes crate training and housetraining. Because it will be extremely difficult to reward and direct both dogs at the same time, you should set up individual training sessions so that you are properly training your dogs.You can also have someone else train one dog while you are training the other one.
Because older dogs often lapse in their training when they are adjusting to a new environment, you may also need to retrain members of a bonded pair as well. Depending on the level of separation anxiety, you should also try to train them separately.

, With multiple puppies, you should be sure to walk and play with each dog individually. This will ensure that you are properly leash training each puppy without any interference from the other dog. You should also play with them separately to ensure that they are socialized as individuals and not a pair.If you adopt a bonded pair, you may want to walk them together if they are already leash trained. If not, you will need to separate them for training as well.
A bonded pair can play together since they have already been socialized as a pair and not individuals.

Purchase a step in harness.,
Unbuckle the harness and lay it flat on the ground.,
Have your dog stand over the harness.,
Secure the straps.,
Adjust the harness to fit your pup.",How to Put on a Puppy Harness2," A step in harness is great for dogs that go on long walks or hikes. It is a very minimalist design, with a wraparound style that reduces pressure on your dog’s throat. These harnesses have a single buckle over the shoulder, making them easy to put on and take off fast. In most models, the lead is attached to D-rings for an even distribution of pressure on the harness.A step in harness with a thinner chest pad is good for dogs who do not like added bulk in their chest area.A step in harness with a wider chest pad is good for dogs who don’t mind extra bulk. The wider chest pad will give the harness more comfort and coverage. The wide size will also help to stabilize the harness in case your dog pulls on the leash during the walk.
Look online for a step in harness, or at your local pet store. Most step in harnesses come in small, medium, and large, depending on the girth or belly measurement of your dog.
Note that most harnesses are not adequate restraints in a motor vehicle. Do not use a regular harness as a seat belt /restraint unless it specifically says on the packaging that it is designed for this purpose.

, It should be open, with the top of the buckle facing the ground.


Keep some treats close by to reward your pup once you put on the harness., Then, place her left leg in the left loop and her right leg in the right loop.


You may need to pet her and coax her to stand over the harness. You can also enlist the help of a friend or partner to help you place your dog over the harness.

, Reach around your dog's neck and snap the buckles together over her neck.

, Step back and look at your dog in the harness. Does it look like it is pinching or squeezing her? Does it hang too low on her body? Use the adjustment points, or clips that are attached to the straps, to adjust the harness so it fits her properly. Most step-in harnesses have adjustment points on either side of the straps around your dog's neck and on the straps around her belly.


The harness should be snug but also loose enough for you to fit two fingers comfortably between your dog and the harness at any point.
Test the fit of the harness before you attach the leash to the harness. Only give your pup a treat for a job well done once she is in the harness and ready for a walk.

"
"
Introduce the harness to your puppy after some playing and petting.,
Attach the harness right away or wait a few seconds before attaching it.,
Reward your puppy with a treat once the harness is secure.,
Let her wear the harness 5-10 minutes a day.",How to Put on a Puppy Harness3," Like a collar, your puppy will likely have to get used to wearing a harness. But it can take more time for your puppy to get used to a harness than it did for her to get used to a collar. Some puppies recoil or struggle against the harness. So play with her and pet her for a few minutes before putting on the harness so she is a relaxed, comfortable state of mind.

, Dog owners have differing opinions on whether you should wait before attaching the harness on your pup or just secure it right away. Gauge your puppy’s reaction to the harness. If she recoils from it or struggles against it, pet her for a few seconds before securing the harness. But if she doesn’t seem to mind the harness, secure it right away.

, Don’t give her a treat if she recoils from the harness and you have to remove it. You only want to reward her if she consents to wearing the harness and is ready for a walk.

, This will help her get used to wearing it. Once your pup gets comfortable with the harness, she will look forward to her daily walk and you will look forward to not having to worry about her running off without you.

Avoid Pet stores and puppy mills.",How to Buy a Chocolate Labrador," While every dog is different, recognizing the common behavioral traits and characteristics often found in Chocolate Labs will help you determine if this is the right breed to bring into your home.


Expect your lab to be loyal, lovable, and happy. These positive traits make him the number one registered dog in the American Kennel Club. Anticipate a boisterous and energetic temperament. The Lab has the reputation of being one of the most sweet-natured breeds, and is outgoing, eager to please, and friendly with both people and other animals. ;
, Chocolate Labs make great additions to homes with small children or other pets, and are well-suited for homes that have a good deal of space.


Prepare for clumsiness. A young Lab can be accurately described as a “bull in a China shop!” This means that you can expect vases to be knocked over by wagging tails, and carpets to be displaced by skidding dogs.

, Chewing and mouthing is a common problem among Labradors, and this breed requires an ample amount of chew toys on hand to prevent the destruction of your valuable possessions. Consider the need to enroll your Chocolate Lab in obedience training.
Plan to train your Chocolate Lab before he gets too large to control. As the Chocolate Lab is a relatively large dog, teaching him manners is vital. This includes learning not to nip (playful bites), not to jump on people or barge them over, and to relieve themselves in appropriate locations.

, All Labs love activity and require it for a happy and healthy life!


Prepare to exercise your Chocolate Labs. This breed needs exercise to keep their cardiovascular and muscular systems healthy. Every adult Labrador should have a minimum daily walk of at least half an hour, and a longer and more vigorous exercise session of 1-2 hours at least three times a week. Expect to give your Labrador the opportunity to run every day in order to burn off excess energy. , A male Chocolate Lab can weigh up to 80lbs, meaning that he will eat a lot of dog food. In addition to food, veterinary costs can be very high, and you should budget for some kind of pet insurance. Ensure you are financially secure enough to purchase a Chocolate Lab.

, While Chocolate Labs are generally healthy dogs, they can be plagued with certain health issues that must be identified and managed. Health problems can be inherited genetically (including cancer, epilepsy, and autoimmune diseases), or can be caused by the environment (contact with chemicals, medications, breathing in smoke). Some of the more common health problems include hip and/or elbow dysplasia, obesity, epilepsy, cataracts, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), tricuspid valve dysplasia, gastric dilation-volvulus, myopathy, cold tail, and ear infections. Visit your veterinarian if you have any concerns regarding your Chocolate Lab’s health. If you see signs or symptoms indicating the onset of any of these conditions, it is best to get your dog checked by his vet as soon as possible.

, There is nothing like a new puppy, with his cute and affectionate disposition and his big round eyes. However, a puppy requires a large time commitment, especially during their first year of life. Ensure your puppy has all his immunizations. Puppies should receive a set of four injections every three weeks starting at six weeks old.
House-train your Labrador Puppy and take him outside every few hours (at least) to relieve themselves.
Socialize your Chocolate Lab puppy when he is young. The goal is to encourage positive, respectful, and calm interactions with other people and animals.
Provide obedience training to instill a solid foundation in good behavior. Obedience classes will help shape the personality of your puppy for years to come. , Adding an adult Chocolate Lab to your home can be a very worthwhile experience, as older dogs are less likely to be adopted and often the first to be euthanized. Ask the shelter or individual from whom you are adopting your Lab about his behavior and personality. Your dog’s general demeanor will be largely established by age 3, so it is important to know what to expect. Be patient and understanding of a dog who has had a past life. This can mean that he has been traumatized in certain ways, or has not been exposed to certain things. Even something as benign as a vacuum cleaner can incite a fearful response from your dog.
Recognize that your older dog has different needs than a puppy. This can include requiring more vet visits for health issues, needing food made for mature canines, and adjusting exercise schedules accordingly.

, Chocolate Labs are very versatile dogs. They were originally bred for physically demanding jobs, and have made the transition to family pets as well. Decide if you want a Lab bred for competition. You can select a dog bred for his skill as a working dog or bred for the ideal look, movement, and temperament of the breed. Select an English Labrador if you are looking for a dog bred for show and conformation. This dog will be heavier, stockier, and have a thicker coat than American Labradors. He will also be calmer, quieter, and less active.
Purchase an American Labrador if you want a dog bred for field trials and hunting. This dog will be slimmer, more agile, and have a thinner coat than English Labradors. Additionally, he will have a higher energy level.

, A good breeder will many health checks on both the sire and dam before breeding them to reduce the risk of health concerns in the litter and will openly provide this information to you. If adopting your dog as an adult, you may need to ask for this information.


Request to see health clearances for hip dysplasia and a ‘clear eye certificate’ (indicating no evidence of PRA). Pay special attention to your Chocolate Lab’s overall appearance, visible health, and activity level. You should be able to recognize any changes in energy, eating habits, behavior, or appearance once you bring your Lab home.

, This will have an effect on the personality of your puppy as he grows into an adult dog. The breeder should be willing and able to provide details on both parents. If possible, ask to meet the parents of the puppies. You can learn about the potential looks and temperament of your new puppy by meeting his parents.

, Regardless of whether you adopt a puppy or adult dog from a breeder or a shelter, he will need your love, attention, and time.

, A good breeder is the best place to purchase a Labrador puppy. In order to get a happy and healthy dog, never buy from an irresponsible breeder. Choose a breeder who tests her dogs to make sure they are free from genetic diseases and checks that the parents have sound temperaments. Pay specific attention to parental clearance from hip dysplasia and PRA.
Talk to the breeder about any other illness the breeding stock may have. This can include epilepsy, osteoarthritis, or exercise induced collapse. Look for a breeder that breeds her Chocolate Lab puppies in her home. While there are exceptions, many kennel-bred puppies are not well-socialized and have not been given enough human attention. , Chocolate Lab puppies should not leave their litters before this age. This can be a sign of a puppy mill.

, These references can tell you about their adoption experience, how their dog is doing, whether any health problems have surfaced in their dogs, and provide details about the breeder during the sale and throughout the life of the dog.


Visit the National Labrador Retriever Club website to find a full list of breeders in good standing with the National Labrador Retriever Club who may be available to answer questions about choosing reputable breeders and can explain the importance of screening for hereditary diseases and tell you about their upcoming litters.

, Adopting a Chocolate Lab in need of a loving home can be an incredibly rewarding experience, but is not without its challenges. Before adopting, you should do the following:


Make contact with your local Labrador Rescue. Express your interest in adoption, and find out about their requirements regarding home visits. Many rescue societies will want to check out you and your family to make sure that your home and lifestyle is suitable for the adoption of one of their dogs. Identify a Labrador available for adoption and visit the dog. Ask for details about the dog’s past, including any behavioral problems or training issues. , Dogs that end up in rescues are not always the best behaved or best trained dogs. With the right care and in the right home, these behavioral problems can often be overcome; however, this takes time. Volunteer with your local animal shelter or rescue. Most rescue organizations are very grateful for voluntary help, and activities can range from caring for dogs, to providing foster homes, to carrying out home checks for prospective adoptive families. This can be a great way to understand the pros and cons of adopting a rescue dog without committing to the adoption process.
Learn more about adoption from a shelter from wikiHow!

, Many pet stores sell puppies purchased from puppy mills, a breeding facility with the purpose of breeding the most dogs for the least money. Poor breeding conditions and inbreeding can cause serious health problems for puppy mill dogs. Visit your breeder in person, and do not blindly trust online ads. Many puppy millers pose as family breeders online and in ads in newspapers and magazines. Take the time to ensure you are buying from a reputable breeder.
Beware of sellers offering multiple different breeds and types of puppies for sale. Be wary if you are shown puppies one at a time, without the dam or littermates present. Never purchase puppies that are caged or crated when shown to you. Avoid the temptation to “rescue” a puppy mill dog by buying him. Purchasing a puppy from a mill puts money back into the pockets of the puppy mill industry, and opens up a space for another puppy mill puppy.
Alert your local animal control authorities if you see anyone keeping puppies in poor conditions.

Teach your dog tricks.",How to Play With Your Puppy," Pick a time when your puppy is energetic and hasn't eaten recently. Wait at least an hour after your puppy eats if you're going to play gently, or 90 minutes if you're going to play rough. If you don't wait enough between eating and playing, your puppy may get a stomach ache or even develop a life-threatening condition (gastric torsion) where the stomach swings over and twists on itself.If you're going to let kids play along during playtime, always make sure you or an adult are supervising. Your puppy may not understand the fine distinction between playing and teasing. If your puppy becomes frustrated, he may nip out of confusion.;
, Not all puppies like the same things. Some like to run and hunt things, others like to chew, while others are motivated by smell and love to follow scent trails. Watch your puppy to see what makes him happy, and what he tends to do naturally. It may take you time to find out what your puppy likes.


For example, if he's always got his nose to the ground sniffing, then he probably likes to follow scents. Or, if he simply sits and watches a ball fly off, then he's probably not fond of fetch.

, Add simple commands to playtime. For example, if your dog adores chasing a ball, then he'll be motivated to learn the command ""give"" in order to release the ball so you can throw it again. Or, your dog may obey commands like ""sit"" and ""stay"" if he knows you'll reward him with a game of fetch. You can also use a clicker to train while playing. For instance, you could click right before throwing the ball, tell him to ""sit"" and click again when he sits on the ground. This way, your dog associates the action with a reward of fetch.Realize that you don't have to reward your dog only with food. The reward of more playtime and your attention can be powerful motivators.

, Since puppies are usually energetic, it's hard to remember that they can become overtired. A puppy has growing bones and slack ligaments supporting those bones. If he becomes overtired, he might move awkwardly and damage those growing joints. Make sure not to overtire the puppy, so stop while he still has some energy.When you do stop, end on a good note that leaves your puppy wanting more, instead of playing him till he's completely exhausted. If he's worn out, he'll become grumpy from tiredness.

, While play might seem like a fun afterthought, it's actually an important way to socialize your dog. Dogs that play well and respond to basic commands are more fun to have around and are also more sociable. You can learn about your dog and his personality by playing games. You'll also discover dislikes or fears that your dog may have.


Not only will playing help you bond with your puppy, but it will give both of you a great chance for exercise. Play will also provide valuable mental stimulation for your puppy., Use a tugger rope toy designed for play, not another household item like a shoe. If you use something that's not a toy, your puppy will be confused into thinking he's allowed to play with household things. Pull somewhat gently on the tugger rope toy, since it is possible to damage your puppy's teeth by pulling too hard. If your puppy is under one year old, use caution when playing. Puppies have soft spots at the top of their heads that can injure easily.


Some people believe that playing tug-of-war can make your dog possessive. For this reason, you may not want to play it with large dogs from guarding breeds. Their superior physical strength and protective instinct could cause them to dominate.Your puppy may benefit from playing tug-of-war if he's shy or anxious. Allowing him to win could boost his confidence., Tell your puppy to ""sit"" and ""stay."" Show him a treat and then hide yourself. Call your puppy's name when you're in your hiding place. He should search until he finds you. This game teaches your puppy to come when called and how to find you when you cannot be seen. It will also give your puppy practice at following scents.


If your puppy breaks from the ""stay"" command before you've reached your hiding place, try commanding your puppy to ""wait."", Show your puppy a ball or toy and command him to ""sit"" or ""wait"". Throw the toy a short distance and encourage the puppy to both get the toy, but to come back to you. Coach him through the process by saying things like ""get it"" and ""bring it"" and make a big fuss for every successful stage of the game. End the game on a high note while it is still interesting to the puppy. This will also establish your authority.


Fetch can teach your puppy to give on command, a valuable skill that could keep him safe. Once your puppy is holding the toy he fetched, offer a high-value reward. Give the command ""give"" at the moment he drops the toy and reward him with the treat.Never throw sticks when playing fetch. Your puppy could accidentally run onto a stick, causing a painful injury., Once your puppy has mastered basic commands, teach a few tricks like rolling over or playing dead. Spend about 10 minutes each session and be sure to offer rewards for correct behavior before your name the trick.For example, show your puppy what you want him to do, like getting him to give you a paw, and reward him him when he does it correctly several times in a row. Then you can begin calling the command ""shake.""


Tricks exercise your puppy's mind, teach focus and enable you to bond. Do no overwork any given trick, just revisit it often and always end on a high note.
You can also try mind games like teaching your puppy the location of his toys, family members, and where his bed is. Then, hide an item like car keys and tell your puppy to ""go find"" them.

Establish your position.,
Use your voice.,
Use a crate.,
When your puppy is entering the crate on his own, shut the door for short periods of time.,
Help him learn to become housebroken.,
Deal with chewing.",How to Obedience Train Your Puppy Before It's 10 Weeks Old1," Right from the start you should establish yourself as your puppy's ""pack leader"" by showing strong leadership, consistency and affection. Puppies will sense your confidence levels, and bad habits can develop at a young age if you are not consistent. This doesn't mean punishing your nine week old puppy if he chews a rug, but is more about clarifying your control over certain aspects, such as when your puppy must be in his crate.Be sure you have time set aside to be close to him when he first arrives at your house. He will need careful supervision in the very first weeks.
Techniques used on older puppies, such making your puppy walk at heel or behind you, or only being fed after you have eaten, will not be so successful with such a young puppy.
But you can begin to assert your position but not breaking eye contact, and showing him that he is only fed at particular times.;
, Although your puppy may not yet understand commands, he will respond to your tone of voice. Adjust how you to speak to help your puppy understand what you are saying. As a basic rule deep or low pitched sounds indicate disappointment or disapproval, and high pitched sounds suggest enthusiasm and play. Keep this in mind when you are talking to your puppy.Maintain a normal volume for normal talk. This way your dog will understand that raising your voice means increased urgency.
Talking quietly or whispering can be a very effective way to get a dog's attention., The crate is an essential part of training your puppy and of them learning to live in your house. This is especially the case in the first weeks you have him. The crate is a safe place, like a play pen for a baby, and it can help calm anxious dogs and teach them when to sleep. When your puppy is at this very young stage, he may be required to spend quite a lot of time in their crate, but remember this is just temporary. It is keeping them safe and helping them adapt.


Help your puppy get used to the crate by initially being home when he is in it. You do not want him to associate the crate with being abandoned.
Motivate your puppy to enter the crate. You should sit with him after keeping the door close for a few minutes. When your puppy investigates the crate, shower him with a lot of praise and show a lot of enthusiasm. You can also place some treats hidden inside the crate to get your puppy to become curious about the crate.

, You can slowly increase the amount of time the door is closed. Try to only open the door when he is not whining or crying. You do not want your puppy to learn that crying opens the door.


Establish it as the place where he sleeps, and if you notice him becoming tired, move him into the crate.
When he is between 7 and 9 weeks, it is advisable to have him sleep in the crate all night, as well as feeding him in the crate, and leaving him there when you are not at home.
He will want to keep his crate clean so it's important that you are attentive and take him out if he needs to go outside., Puppies this young will need to go to the bathroom frequently and won't have the kind of self-control required to stop them peeing on the carpet. It's important to be very attentive at this stage to help your puppy learn that he has to go outside. At this age, your puppy is too young to know he needs to alert you, so you need to watch out for signs, and let him out.


Some of the subtle signs could include him walking a few feet away, walking around in a circles, or sniffing the ground in circles.
Every time he changes between different activities you should take him outside. So, when he wakes up, stops eating, or stops playing, take him outside.
If he urinates inside in front of you, just say something like ""Bad dog"", or ""No"", and take him outside.
If he has urinated inside and you didn't see it, it's no good trying to correct him. He won't feel responsible for a past action., Puppies play with their littermates by chewing on each other, and when he comes home with you he will chew and bite you when you play. Although he is only playing, his sharp teeth can be painful, so it's an important to teach him not to bite you early on. When he bites you, signal your pain by saying ""Ouch!"", and then give him a little shake or pinch. By doing this you are mimicking the reaction of his littermates if he had bitten one of them too hard.


Make it a quick reaction. He will stop for a moment and step back, and then you can go on playing as normal.
If you discover him chewing your shoes, furniture or anything else he is not supposed to, just stop him chewing it and give him a toy to chew instead."

Puppy proof your home.,
Research online for suitable puppy food.,
Get at least two food and water bowls.,
Purchase a dog crate.,
Buy a few dog toys.,
Have dog treats.,
Purchase a collar.,
Get a standard leash.,
Get a dog license tag with your dog's name on it.,
Get some flea/tick topical.,
Have patience.",How to Look After Your First Puppy," Puppies are naturally curious animals, who like to chew up everything and always want to have a full stomach. Make sure to meet the requirements for a puppy-proof home.

Clean up any chemicals, and then put them in a cupboard. To puppies, chemicals like antifreeze can smell like candy, and they will lap it up eagerly, so make sure everything is put away properly.
Pick up any objects littering the floor. This includes kids' toys, tissues, slippers, clothing, pencils, etc. Until your puppy learns not to pick stuff up off of the floor, you don't want to risk having to take your puppy in for surgery to remove the object.
Close the doors to other rooms. Having to clean and puppy-proof the entire house can be a daunting task, so limit the dog to only a few rooms at first (it's easier on the dog, too - an entire house can be intimidating). For example, the kitchen and the living room for the puppy, and then let the puppy go into other times throughout the time that passes.;
, Be sure to pick the one that fits your puppy's needs. Consider getting dry kibble. Make sure it isn't tested on animals except for taste testing, and make sure it doesn't have any ingredients such as poultry or meat by-product, which contain things that are unhealthy for your dog. Also, make sure that you get dog food intended for your dog's age - puppy, adult, or senior.

Be sure to have good water as well. Either from the sink, tap, or bottled water, it will be okay for your puppy. However, rainwater isn't recommended even if it's filtered.

, Stainless steel bowls are preferable; don't get a ceramic or plastic one. If you are bringing home a breed with a voracious appetite (like a Lab), consider a raised feeder., Having somewhere for your dog to sleep can be a real time saver. You don't have to worry about your dog developing bad habits while you are away/asleep, such as peeing on the floor or eating the couch. A comfortable dog bed would also be useful for the puppy., These are important since your dog will chew on these instead of furniture, and playing with your puppy helps you bond. Be sure they are dog friendly and have no loose or sharp parts, or parts that a puppy could accidentally swallow and choke on., This is essential for training your puppy, and helps in creating that bond between you and your puppy. Both average treats and special tiny treats are preferred - they should both be used for training as well as spending time with and rewarding your puppy., Be sure that it is safe for your puppy and the proper size as well. Choose one that isn't too tight, but not too loose either., Choke chains can hurt your dog, and retractable leashes make it easier for your dog to run away. Be sure it can easily latch onto the puppy's collar as well., If your puppy ever somehow gets lost, it will be much more easier to track it down. Consider getting a microchip tag as well. You will have a better chance of finding them if they run away., This will help clean your puppy's fur if ticks or fleas ever get into it. Be sure to have a bathtub so that you can bathe your puppy as well. Purchase some dog-friendly shampoo as well for a better chance of easily cleaning your puppy. Get a suitable dog brush as well - it will be much easier to clean off their fur and straighten it out. If your dog is long haired, use a brush made for longhairs; if your dog is shorthaired, use a brush made for shorthairs., Your puppy will grow quickly, and proper training will ensure no bad puppy behaviours grow with it."

Redirect your dog when it digs for fun.,
Make sure that your puppy is comfortable.,
Reduce your puppy’s stress.,
Prevent your puppy from burying treats and toys.,
Reduce your puppy’s boredom.,
Control prey animals.",How to Make a Puppy Stop Digging1," Dogs may dig purely for entertainment.You may notice your puppy digging along with other play behavior, such as running around and jumping. This can be the most difficult type of digging behavior to prevent, since it is so rewarding to your puppy. However, you can:


Offer your puppy a dedicated digging area.
Erect fencing to deter your puppy’s digging habits.;
, Dogs may dig to find cooler (or warmer) and more comfortable places to lay.In hot weather, dirt below the surface will be cooler than at the surface (this is especially true in shaded areas such as under trees), while in cool weather it will be warmer. To reduce this type of digging behavior:


Make sure that your puppy has access to a shaded or covered area, such as a dog house.
You can also provide your puppy a shallow wading pool to keep cool.
When it is especially hot, you may want to allow your puppy access to the indoors and air conditioning.
If your puppy is cold, offer it a blanket, insulated dog house, or some time indoors.
If your puppy digs to find a more comfortable place to lay, offer it a dog bed or other soft surface.

, Dogs may dig to express anxiety, such as when they are separated from their owners.You can help your puppy get over separation anxiety in order to stop its digging habit and reduce its stress level., Dogs may dig in order to bury “valuables.”The wild ancestors of dogs would bury food so that they could return to it later. Your puppy may express this instinct by burying food, toys, treats, and other objects. To discourage your dog from digging for this reason:


Don’t give your puppy treats it won’t finish right away.
Remove treats and store them or throw them away if your puppy doesn’t finish them right away. Seek professional help if you need it.
If you give your puppy a digging pit, it can learn to happily bury toys and other objects without destroying your yard.

, Your puppy may dig if it is bored. If your puppy is left alone outside for long periods, or has no toys or other things to play with outside, it may turn to digging for entertainment.This behavior can usually be corrected easily, by giving your puppy more to do.


Make sure to walk your puppy at least twice a day; it needs plenty of exercise and stimulation. If your puppy feels confined in a pen, yard, or other area, it may dig to try and escape.Play games with your puppy frequently, such as throwing a ball or frisbee for it to fetch.
Give your puppy plenty of toys to play with outside, and change these frequently to keep it interested.
Teaching your puppy new tricks can also keep it active. There may even be dog training classes in your area for the two of you to enjoy.

, Dogs may dig to find prey, such as moles, rabbits, and badgers.The best solution is to humanely trap and remove these animals. Contact a humane animal control service for assistance.


You can also make your yard unattractive to these animals.For example, if you have chipmunks running rampant in your yard, surround it with plant-free gravel and remove wood or rock piles.Contact professional help if you need it.
Avoid using poisons or other dangerous methods to control unwanted animal residents in your yard, as these may harm your puppy as well.

Try some simple commands.,
Play tug of war.,
Play fetch.,
Use a leash.,
Be calm and patient.,
Be positive.",How to Obedience Train Your Puppy Before It's 10 Weeks Old2," You can start teaching your puppy some simple commands even at this young age. Simple commands are crucial for your long-term relationship, and basic obedience training will make your life together easier and more fun.""Sit"" is a good place to start. You will just need a few soft treats to help him along. Hold the treat in front of his nose and then slowly tilt his head up and back towards his tail. He will move back into a sitting position, and as he does this, say ""sit"". Praise him and give him the treat.You can teach him ""down"" by starting from a sitting position and holding the treat in front of his nose. Lower the treat down and he will lower down. Say ""down"" as he moves and then give him and treat and praise him.
You may need to keep one hand above his back to discourage him from standing up.
You can teach him ""come"", just by moving away from him, holding out a treat, and saying ""come""., Puppies love to play tug of war, and it can be a great way to teach them to drop things on command. After playing for a while say ""drop"" to instruct him to release the object. If he doesn't let you take it, you can gently blow on his face. This will normally prompt him to drop the object and take a step backwards. Be sure to use the command ""drop"".


If blowing doesn't work, gently squeeze one of his front paws. When he feels that his paw is stuck, he will open his mouth, dropping the object, and look down at his paw.Always use a gentle voice and remember that at this age it is all about learning while having fun together. Keep the sessions short and be sure to reward good behaviour., Another great game you can play with a puppy this young is fetch. Playing this will help him learn to retrieve things and bring them back to you. Get two toys that look identical and throw one of them down the hallway. Hopefully the puppy will chase after the object and bring it back to you. If he picks it up and walks towards you but doesn't stop, the trick is to grab him not the toy. If you show that you want the toy too soon, he won't come near you next time.


Take hold of him as he goes past and praise him for returning. Then you can begin to get him interested in the second toy you are holding.
He will learn that if he brings something back to you, you will throw something else for him to chase. In the future he will be happy to give up the first toy because he knows there is going to be another one., If you playing outside with a puppy this young you need to be very attentive. It's a good idea to put him on a long-leash even if you are playing in your garden and there are no escape routes. This will help him get used to being on a leash, but will also enable you to control where he can go. Use a leash of 10-15 feet, but make sure it is light and not too much of a physical burden for such a young puppy., Remember that a puppy of ten weeks old is still very young and his comprehension is limited. Don't try to go too fast too soon, and be patient if he seems not to be picking things up. Puppies can be very easily distracted, so don't allow yourself to be frustrated. Be consistent, stay calm, and have fun. Accidents will happen in these first weeks. Don't have unfair expectations of a ten week old puppy.

, With a young puppy it's important to reinforce the positive, and ignore the negative where possible. For example, if he chews your shoe that's your fault for leaving it out. When the dog does something wrong remove the dog from the situation, and distract them with an appropriate chew toy. Puppies this young are infants and will not understand you trying to discipline them."

Set aside a dedicated digging location for your puppy.,
Encourage your puppy to dig in its pit.Take some of your puppy’s favorite treats or toys and bury them in its designated dig area.,
Troubleshoot if your puppy won’t dig like it is supposed to.",How to Make a Puppy Stop Digging2," If your puppy has its own play area or sandbox, it can practice its digging instincts without ruining your yard.Try dividing your yard into cared-for areas (lawns, gardens, etc.), and a place where your puppy is free to dig.You can use a commercial sandbox, or simply cover the designated area with loose soil or sand.
Use bricks, stones, sticks, or fencing to help your puppy recognize the digging area, and keep it from making holes in other places.If your puppy has been digging up specific areas of your yard, place rocks or chicken wire over them while it gets used to the digging pit. These deterrents will discourage your puppy from digging in those spots.
Some experts recommend burying dog feces in an area where a dog digs.Their theory suggests that dogs do not like to dig in the presence of feces. However, this will only discourage your puppy from digging in a specific area, and will not stop the general behavior.

, Your puppy will enjoy uncovering these treasures, and begin to associate that area (instead of your lawn, flower bed, etc.) with digging.


If your puppy has trouble understanding, make sure it sees you bury the treat or toy first. Alternatively, you can bury one and then uncover it yourself while your puppy watches.
Once your puppy starts to get used to the digging area, try putting new treats in it, or bury them deeper. This will keep your puppy interested.
Whenever your puppy digs in its area like it is supposed to, give it a treat. The positive reinforcement will encourage the behavior you want.

, If your puppy still has a problem with digging in areas you don’t want it to, even after trying to train it to use a designated digging area, then you will need to devote closer attention to the problem.Watch your puppy as it plays outside. When you see it start to dig in an area that you don’t want it to, clap your hands sharply to get its attention. Then, immediately lead it over to the dig area and encourage it to dig there instead.


Be persistent. It may take some time to adjust your puppy’s behavior.

Consider installing fencing to deter your puppy’s digging.,
Gather the supplies you will need.,
Lay the fence foundation.,
Lay large rocks on top of the chicken wire.These rocks will weigh the chicken wire down so that your puppy will not be able to dig it up easily.,
Install the chain link fence.Make sure that the bottom of the chain link fence is buried one or two feet below the surface.,
Lay more chicken wire on the ground.Roll out more chicken wire on the ground along the fence line; you anchor it to the bottom of the chain link fence.",How to Make a Puppy Stop Digging3," A physical barrier can either prevent your puppy from digging in a particular area, or make it difficult enough that your puppy loses interest.You can either simply install garden fencing in sections of your yard that you do not want your puppy to enter (and possibly dig in), or you can construct a more dog-proof fencing system.


Motion-activated fencing lines that make a noise or spray water when something crosses them are another option for keeping your puppy out of a certain area. However, these may be costly, and may not prevent your puppy from digging in the ground around them.

, Fences can be constructed of various materials. To create a fencing system that is safe enough to not hurt your puppy while still discouraging its digging habit, however, you will need to gather specific materials from a hardware, garden, or home supply store:Chicken wire
Chain-link fence
Large rocks

, Start by burying chicken wire along the line of where where you want the fence to be.This will be the actual material to stop your puppy from digging in the ground; it is strong enough that your puppy can’t dig through it, but soft enough that your puppy won’t be hurt if it tries. Do make sure, however, to bend back the edges of the chicken wire.

, Bury the rocks partially in the dirt, so that you will know where the chicken wire is located.

, Installing the fence to this depth will ensure that your puppy cannot dig out easily.

, This layer of chicken wire will make it unattractive as a digging area to your puppy.

Ensure the puppies get passive immunity.,
Purchase a commercial puppy formula.,
Bottle feed the puppies.,
Use caution if tube feeding the puppies.,
Consider using a surrogate mother dog.",How to Prevent Disease in Orphaned Newborn Puppies1," Passive immunity protects newborn puppies from disease until they’re old enough to get vaccinated. They get this immunity through colostrum (‘first milk’), which a mother dog produces during its puppies’ first day of life.Without a mother, your orphaned newborn puppies will need another source of passive immunity.


Plasma and serum, which are two components of blood, can provide passive immunity. Your vet can collect plasma and serum from adult healthy dogs.Talk with your vet about collecting the plasma and serum before the puppies are born. That way, you can be prepared to give them passive immunity if necessary.;
, After their first day of life, the orphaned puppies will need puppy formula to keep them healthy and prevent disease, since they won’t be able to get milk from their mother. High-quality commercial puppy formulas are available at pet stores, and maybe at your vet’s office.Examples of high-quality commercial puppy formulas are Esbilac® and Puppylac®.If you cannot get purchase puppy formula right away, make an emergency puppy formula at home. Mix one cup of milk, one tablespoon of corn oil, one pinch of salt, and three egg yolks (no whites) in a bowl.Feed the emergency formula until you can purchase commercial puppy formula.

, Orphaned newborn puppies should be bottle fed or tube fed. Bottle feeding is preferable.Tube feeding is good for puppies that can’t suckle very well, but increases the risk of a puppy inhaling the formula into its lungs, causing aspiration pneumonia.Here are some bottle feeding tips:Warm the formula to 99 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37 to 38 degrees Celsius) on the stove. Do not use the microwave.
Use a needle to poke a few small holes in the bottle’s nipple so the milk comes out as drips.
Burp the puppies after feeding.
Rub a moist, warm cotton ball or towel around each puppy’s anus to stimulate urination and defecation after each feeding.
Watch for milk coming out of the nose, indicating the puppy is drinking too quickly.

, Not all orphaned puppies have a good suckle reflex. If some of the orphaned puppies cannot suck on a bottle, you will need to tube feed them. Have your vet or an experienced breeder show you how to properly tube feed your orphaned puppies., A surrogate mother dog could give your orphaned newborn puppies the chance to get colostrum in their first day of life. If you use a surrogate mother, watch it the entire time it is with the puppies. It may reject the puppies and try to kill them.If the surrogate mother accepts the puppies, it could nurse the puppies beyond their first day of life.
Before the puppies are born, talk with your vet about using a surrogate mother dog.

To prevent these parasites from causing disease, have your vet deworm your puppies at two, four, six, and eight weeks of age. Then, give your puppies a monthly preventive that protects against heartworm disease and intestinal parasites.A deworming medication kills the intestinal parasites.
Give the monthly preventative year-round to give your puppies full protection from diseases caused by worms.

, By being orphaned, your newborn puppies may not receive enough passive immunity to be fully protected from disease. Your vet may recommend starting your puppies’ vaccinations earlier than usual to make up for the lack of immunity.Healthy puppies that have nursed well usually start their series of vaccinations between 6 and 8 weeks of age.Your vet will recommend how early your orphaned puppies should start receiving their vaccinations.

, Orphaned newborn puppies are at higher risk for sickness because of their lack of passive immunity. For this reason, you should keep your orphaned newborn puppies inside and away from other dogs that could make them sick.If you have other dogs in your home, keep them away from the orphaned puppies until the puppies are vaccinated.
Keeping the puppies inside will prevent them from being exposed to feces of other dogs. These feces could contain parasites that would sicken the puppies.

, The color of a newborn puppy’s feces can indicate whether the puppy is healthy or not. After you stimulate each puppy to defecate after a meal, look at the color of the feces. The feces should be brown and partially formed. If the feces are green, the puppy likely has an infection.Contact your vet if you see green feces. Your puppy will need to be treated for the infection.

Keep the puppies’ environment warm.,
Adjust the environmental temperature each week.,
Observe how the puppies lie within the nesting box.,
Take the puppies’ rectal temperatures.",How to Prevent Disease in Orphaned Newborn Puppies3," Newborn puppies depend on heat from their mother to keep them warm. Without a mother, orphaned newborn puppies are at risk of becoming cold, which could quickly become an emergency situation.Use artificial sources of heat to keep the nesting box warm:


Heating pad: set the heating pad on low, wrap it in a towel, and place it under half of the nesting box. In case the puppies get too warm, they’ll need a space in the nesting box where they can move to cool off.Heat lamp: place it over one side of the nesting box.Use a thermometer to monitor the temperature.

, In the first two weeks of life, newborn puppies cannot regulate their own body temperature. Until the puppies are four weeks old, you will need adjust the temperature to keep them warm and comfortable. Reposition the heat sources and continue using a thermometer:First week: 84 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit (29 to 32 degrees Celsius)
Second week: 79 to 84 degrees Fahrenheit (26 to 29 degrees Celsius)
Third week: 73 to 79 degrees Fahrenheit (23 to 26 degrees Celsius)
Fourth through twelfth weeks: 73 degrees Fahrenheit (23 degrees Celsius)

, The way the puppies lay in the nesting box will let you know if they are comfortable, too hot, or too cold. If the puppies are piled on top of each other, they are cold and using each other to stay warm. If they’re spread far apart, the puppies are too warm. If they’re lying next to each other, they’re comfortable., A newborn puppy’s body temperature should be between 95 and 99 degrees Fahrenheit (35 and 37 degrees Celsius).A body temperature below 95 degrees Fahrenheit is dangerous—the puppy’s heart will slow down and the digestive tract won’t work very well.If any of the puppies’ body temperatures drop below 95 degrees Fahrenheit, slowly warm them up over two to three hours.Place the cold puppy on a hot water bottle.Wrap the water bottle with a towel so the puppy’s skin doesn’t get burned. The puppy will likely move off the water bottle when it warms up.

Be sure your puppy gets socialized.,
Exercise your dog well on the way to get your new puppy.,
Also on the way home, take them both out to a new area, somewhere your dog has been before, but other dogs haven't.,
Allow both dogs to socialize with each other, but try not to interfere too much.",How to Live With a New Puppy2," Socializing with other dogs in your household is best done away from home, for example, while on a walk.

, (And keep them separate in the car ride home.)

, Your puppy is NOT vaccinated yet.

, Only use distraction if either looks unhappy with the situation.


Your oldest dog will be more distracted by the new sights and smells surrounding it, and will probably take short notice to the newcomer.

"
"
Watch their interactions.,
Don't be surprised at any point if your cat isn't that excited about the new addition.,
If your cat is very shy and will run away, be prepared to distract your puppy so that it is not tempted to give a chase.

",How to Live With a New Puppy3," Usually, introductions between household cats and young puppies go quite smoothly. When introducing your puppy to your cat, restrain the puppy, not the cat.

, If you have a very independent cat, it will probably hiss and spit at the puppy until it retreats.

Understand how dogs are grouped together.,
Familiarize yourself with the toy breeds.,
Study the terrier breeds.,
Familiarize yourself with the hound breeds.,
Learn about the herding breeds.,
Study the sporting breeds.,
Familiarize yourself with the working breeds.,
Learn about non-sporting breeds.",How to Learn Breeds of Dogs1," There are more than 150 dog breeds recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC).These breeds are organized into seven groups based upon characteristics and function of the dogs.


Remember that these 150 breeds are only the tip of the iceberg. There are over 400 breeds worldwide.;
, The toy breeds are the smallest breeds of dogs. They can be long haired or short haired, with floppy ears or erect ears, and all fur colors imaginable. Their primary purpose (function) is to be companions to their human owners. They are ideal pets for dog lovers that live in small homes or apartments in cities.


These dogs are usually weigh 10 pounds or less. Due to their smaller size, they generally cost less to own than larger breeds of dogs and can be physically easier to control.
Popular toy breeds include Chihuahuas, toy poodles, Pekinese, Papillion, pugs, and Yorkshire terriers.

, Terriers can also come in all colors and hair coat lengths, although generally their coats are wiry.They were originally bred to hunt rodents and other vermin. They are generally smaller dogs, which were ideal for fitting into tight spots and rodent burrows. However, some of the dogs are a bit bigger and could tackle larger varmints, such as badgers.


Popular terrier breeds include Jack Russell terrier, American Pit Bull Terrier, West Highland Terrier, Cairn terrier, and Fox Terrier.
Terriers have the reputation as being tough and tenacious (aka stubborn) and generally aren’t the best dog for a first time dog owner due to this trait. They need a firm, yet kind, hand in instilling discipline and training otherwise they will try to run the household.

, The hound breeds were developed to assist their humans in hunting. They differ from other hunting dogs in that they hunt more independent of their humans tracking their prey by sight or scent. There are various sizes and shapes of hounds but the main characteristic is their hunting ability. This is a varied group of dog ranging from the enormous Irish wolfhound to the diminutive dachshund.The bloodhound is an example of a hound that tracks by scent. Beagles, bassets, and fox hound are also breeds of scent hounds. Sight hounds are generally lean and fast, tracking prey with their eyes. Salukis, greyhounds, and whippets are good examples of sight hounds,

, The herding breeds have been bred to help farmers and shepherds round up and protect livestock. These hard working dogs work in all sorts of weather and over rough terrain. They generally are high energy breed who need plenty of exercise and a job to do; otherwise they can become bored and destructive.


These dogs are driven to herd, to the point that they will herd children and adults if they have no livestock to control! That being said they will need to be trained not to herd people and given another outlet for their drive and instinct. They make good candidates to be trained for agility or other athletic canine sports.
Popular herding dogs include the Australian Cattle Dog (Blue Heeler), Border Collie, Belgian Malinois, Collies, and Corgis.

, The sporting breeds of dog are the hunting dogs that hunt under the direction of their owners, generally hunting game with a gun. These are divided into the spaniels, the retrievers, and the pointers and setters. Some dogs retrieve game from land or water, other breeds flush game from tall grasses or brush, while others find the game and “point” with nose where the game is hiding.


The Labrador retriever is the epitome of this group. Additionally, it consistently ranks at the top of the short list for the most popular breed of dog in the USA. Not without reason, as generally this dog makes a great family pet in addition to a fine hunting companion.
Other group examples include the Springer spaniel, Golden retriever, English setter, and German Shorthair pointer.

, The working breeds of dogs have been bred to protect and guard humans and their property. They also serve as military and police dogs or as service dogs to disabled or blind persons. In addition, some of these sturdy dogs pull sleds. Because of the nature of their “jobs” the working dog is a large to giant dog ready and able to perform their duties in all kinds of condition.


The Great Pyrenees, a great livestock protector and huge white dog, is one breed in the working group. Alaskan malamutes, Great Danes, Rottweilers, St. Bernard’s and Doberman Pinchers are other popular breeds in the working group.

, The non-sporting breed is a catch-all group for the breeds that don’t fall into the other six categories. This a varied group with no one specific task, function or characteristic. They also come in all kinds of sizes, hair coat length and color.


The Dalmatian, or firehouse dog, is in this group. Its white with black spots coat helps it be easily recognized. The Lhasa Apso—a long haired, small dog—is a popular little companion. The Bulldog, with its thick jowls, stocky build, and tough guy persona is also in the non-sporting group. As you can tell from these three examples, this group has a huge variety of dogs in it.
Other popular dogs in this group include the Bichon Frise, American Eskimo, the French bulldog, the Boston terrier, the Chow Chow, and the Poodle.
Some may question why a dog like the Boston terrier isn't in the terrier group. This is because the breed was not originally bred to hunt rodents, but instead was bred relatively recently from existing breeds.

Keep your corgi in sight at all times for the first couple weeks.,
Create a schedule for food.,
Note when your corgi needs to use the bathroom.,
Take your dog out 5-10 minutes before their usual bathroom time.,
Reward your corgi every time it goes to the bathroom outside.,
Never punish a corgi for going inside.,
Continue taking your corgi outside and rewarding it until it learns.,
Clean up accidents immediately with a solution of white vinegar and baking soda.",How to House Train Corgie Puppies1," You need to make sure your dog is comfortable with you, and you need to know when it needs to go to the bathroom. Keeping it nearby allows you to react to a mess and train your Corgi more quickly.


If you must leave your corgi, put it in a room that is easy to clean, such as one with a tile or linoleum floor.;
, Schedules are very important for a puppy. It teaches it when to expect a meal, and when to expect time outside. In the beginning, do not ""free feed"" your puppy by leaving food out all the time. Provide food at scheduled times.


Veterinarians typically recommend two meals a day.

, Usually, corgis need to use the bathroom after eating or drinking, after playing, and after napping. Watch your corgi carefully and check for signs that it needs to use the bathroom, such as:


Pacing in circles
”Searching” for something
Whining
Running back and forth between you and the door

, Once you can predict when your dog needs to go, try and bring it outside before it happens. Once outside, wait 10-15 minutes for it to go to the bathroom.


Younger corgis have smaller bladders and less control, so take them out frequently, even if you don’t think they need to go.

, Give it a treat, shower it with praise and petting, and let it play with a toy. You want your dog to associate going outside to pee with positive experiences and reinforcement.

, Dogs, especially puppies, do not often have the ability to associate punishment with their own actions. For the dog, going to the bathroom is natural, but the punishment will make it fearful and nervous. More often than not, the dog will resort to hiding its mess, not taking it outside.

, This usually takes between two weeks and a month. Through positive reinforcement, care, and attention, your intelligent corgi can be house trained quickly.

, Mix the two into a paste and let it sit atop the area for five minutes, then wipe away. This will get rid of any odors and hopefully prevent your puppy from repeating the same mistake in that spot.

Start the training early.,
Be firm, gentle, and consistent.,
Reward good behavior.,
Consider crate training your Weimaraner.,
Socialize your Weimaraner.",How to Have a Happy Weimaraner1," Proper training is essential to having a happy Weimaraner. Training should start when the Weimaraner is a puppy. Without early training, that puppy will grow into an adult that will be a real challenge to control.Puppy kindergarten is a great way to start training a Weimaraner puppy.In puppy kindergarten, your Weimaraner will start learning basic obedience skills and learning the proper way to interact with other dogs.;
, Weimaraners need clear, solid leadership so they know their boundaries.Your Weimaraner will be happy when it knows exactly what to do and what not to do. Leadership should not be harsh, though. Harsh leadership will make a Weimaraner wary and fearful, making training very difficult.A Weimaraner needs lifelong training so it always knows the right thing to do.
When you give your Weimaraner commands, say them only once in a clear, authoritative voice. Do not yell.
If you see your Weimaraner misbehave, do not punish or yell at it. Instead, firmly say ‘No!’ and do not reward the behavior.

, Your Weimaraner aims to please you. If you reward your Weimaraner with a tasty treat and verbal praise when it follows your commands and behaves well, it will continue doing the right thing.Your Weimaraner will be so happy to please you and get rewarded in return!

, Weimaraners are very energetic dogs. They can also feel very anxious when separated from their owners. Therefore, crate training may seem like a bad idea, but it’s actually recommended for Weimaraners.When done properly, crate training will give your Weimaraner a safe space to sleep, rest, and play when you’re not home.
Crate training will also help prevent your Weimaraner from being destructive while you’re away.
Start the crate training when your Weimaraner is a puppy.

, Weimaraners can be wary of strangers.Socializing your Weimaraner throughout its life will help it feel comfortable with new experiences, other dogs, and other people.It will also make your Weimaraner feel confident, stable, and happy. Examples of socialization are:


Scheduling play dates with friendly dogs
Introducing your Weimaraner to friendly friends and family
Varying the route of your walks
Taking your Weimaraner to a dog park

Get familiar with the breeds that are common in your area.,
Find information about breeds from a variety of sources.,
Pick a specific breed to focus on.,
Expand your studying to breeds beyond your local area.,
Study the description, standard, and history of each breed.,
Go to dog parks and try to name each breed.,
Go to a local dog show.,
Go to a national dog show if you want to see the prime examples of each breed.",How to Learn Breeds of Dogs2," For instance, if you are in the United States you can study the AKC or Kennel Club recognized breeds first. These are relatively common breeds and are easy to identify.


Study the dogs each for a group at a time. Go through each ""breed type"" in each group, this will make it easier to remember in your head.
First, for example, start with the sporting group (aka gun dog). Get familiar with each breed type in the group, the retrievers, then the pointers, then the spaniels, then the setters.

, Begin by checking out books on dog breeds from the library. You want to make sure that the author is an expert in the field. You should also be sure that the information contained inside will help you learn breeds names and identifying characteristics of dogs.


Also look for online sources. Just as with books, make sure the sources are coming from experts in the field. There are many organizations dedicated to specific breeds, so if you want specific information on a breed, an organization dedicated to them may have good information online.

, If you see a dog that you are particularly interested in, focus your attention on it. Learn all about the history of the breed and its characteristics. While some people like to know a little bit about a lot of breeds, some other people are better at specializing their knowledge.

, For example, after you get familiar with the recognized breeds, get into the Foundation Stock breeds. Foundation Stock breeds are rare breeds that the American Kennel Club keeps record of, but does not register.There are over 600 breeds of dogs in the world, so get familiar with the ones in your area first.

, This will make it easier for you to remember the breed. You can also learn the different breed colorings, coat types, and sizes. You can find the standards for the AKC recognized breeds at www.akc.org.


This will help you get familiar with the breeds, and find certain characteristics that will trigger your memory when you see a dog.
With diligent studying you soon will be able to tell your Keeshond from your coon hounds and become a mini-expert in dog breed recognition. For example, the AKC states that Yorkies should only be blue and tan, but, there are actually some piebald (black and white) Yorkies.

, This will help you familiarize yourself with common, popular breeds. If you need help identifying the breed, do key word internet searches to figure out what kind of dog it is. You can also ask the owner. Most owners love talking about their breed!

, Local dog and 4-H clubs hold pet shows every year in which they feature many breeds of dogs. State and regional dog shows, some specific for hunting dogs or working dogs, take place around the calendar year. Watch the breed rings, group rings, and if you can, best in show.


Look at the dogs in the breed rings, watch how they act, what they look like, and how they move. If you see the dogs in person, you will remember them faster.
Next, go to the group rings. See if you can identify each breed from memory.

, The crème de la crème in the U.S. is the Westminster Kennel Club dog show which takes place in New York City every February. More than 170 dog breeds compete in this show, which is broken down into the dog groups.


Each group competes against itself to choose the top dog; the top dog in each in group then competes in one final showing to choose the overall top dog.The show is also shown on TV every year. Dog breeds are discussed during the televised events, giving viewers a good overall education in dog breeds.

Put your corgi in a comfortable crate when you cannot be with it.,
Choose a crate big enough for the corgi to stretch and turn around, but no bigger.,
Put a comfortable, easily washed pad at the bottom of the crate.,
Wait before letting a whining corgi out of its crate.,
Reward your dog for getting into its crate.,
Take the dog outside immediately when you arrive home.",How to House Train Corgie Puppies2," Unless the puppy came from a pet store, it will rarely urinate where it sleeps. Getting your corgi accustomed to the crate is the best way to care for your corgi when you can’t be with it.


Do not leave young corgis in a crate for more than two hours., If the crate is too large, a puppy might go the bathroom at one end and sleep in the other. This is not only a pain to clean, but unsanitary for the dog.If you want a big crate for the dog to grow into, buy a divider to limit the space it can use when it is small.

, To keep your corgi comfortable, fold a thick blanket or purchase a dog pillow for the bottom of your crate. Use one you can clean in the washing machine following an accident., This may be difficult to do if the dog is complaining, but it takes some time for a corgi to get used to its crate. Give your dog time – if you remove it when it whines, you will have a hard time coaxing it back in.


In time, your dog will become accustomed to its new home.

, Provide positive reinforcement to your dog, so it associates its crate with comfort and love.

, Cooped up, your corgi has likely been holding back from peeing or pooping since you put it in the crate. Take you dog out for a walk so it gets fresh air and the chance to relieve itself.

Give your Weimaraner lots of play and exercise.,
Choose high-intensity games.,
Exercise with your Weimaraner.",How to Have a Happy Weimaraner2," Weimaraners need a lot of daily play and exercise to stay happy. Because Weimaraners love people so much, your Weimaraner will want to play and exercise with you.Block off at least an hour each day to play and exercise with your Weimaraner.


Play and exercise will keep your Weimaraner mentally stimulated, which is important for happiness., When you play with your Weimaraner, get ready to be active! Fetch is a great game to play with a Weimaraner.Consider playing Frisbee, too. If you decide to play Frisbee, use a dog-safe disc, rather than a Frisbee for humans.Your dog will have an easier time handling the disc in its mouth.


Let your Weimaraner chase you around your yard or dog park.
Any game that will encourage your Weimaraner to run and jump will be a good choice.

, In addition to playing, exercise will be a great outlet for your Weimaraner’s energy. If you live near water, let your Weimaraner go swimming when the water is warm.When the weather is nice, go for a long hike in the woods. Long, brisk walks are also a good idea.If there’s a beach close by, let your Weimaraner run on the beach.

"
"
Let your Weimaraner follow you around.,
Allow your Weimaraner to sleep close to you.,
Involve your Weimaraner in family activities.",How to Have a Happy Weimaraner3," Your Weimaraner is like a shadow—it follows you around wherever you go.Rather than shooing your Weimaraner away from you, let it stay right there with you. Your Weimaraner will feel happiest when it’s close to you.


Being shadows can make Weimaraners very prone to separation anxiety.If your Weimaraner has separation anxiety issues, take it to your vet or a veterinary behaviorist. They can develop a plan for your Weimaraner to become comfortable with being alone.

, A Weimaraner’s shadow tendencies don’t stop when it’s bedtime. Your Weimaraner will feel happy and safe when it’s close to you at night. Even if you won’t allow your Weimaraner to sleep in the bed with you, move its bed close to your own., Your Weimaraner will feel happy when it feels like it’s a close part of your family. In addition to letting it follow you around and sleep close to you, consider taking it with you when you take a vacation. Also, let your Weimaraner ride with you in the car when you run errands.

Consider using a roll cage.,
Use safety gear.,
Protect your dog from extreme temperatures.,
Keep your dog safe from snakes.,
Make and carry a first aid kit.,
Treat a wound.,
Check for ticks.,
Soothe arthritis pain.",How to Care for Your Gun Dog," Most dogs should have veterinary checkups at least once each year, but with hunting dogs, you may need semi-annual checkups. Hunting dogs are often exposed to the elements, insects, and a high risk of injury out in the field. Because of these risks, it's important to keep an eye on your dog's health and condition.Be sure your dog is up to date on all of his vaccinations. You may also want to consider vaccinating against Lyme disease, as your gun dog may be at risk in the field.Keep on top of your dog's monthly flea/tick prevention and heartworm medication (if needed in your region). Ask your vet about these and any other preventative medications your dog may need.
Regular checkups are particularly important if your gun dog is in his senior years. Many health issues, including diabetes, thyroid problems, and kidney ailments, tend to develop quickly over a short period of time. Senior dogs may also develop painful arthritis in their joints, which could limit their abilities and require additional medications.;
, Your hunting dog needs a nutritious diet that can provide him with a lot of energy. That means his food should be high in calories that he can burn to stay warm and active out in the field. Try feeding your gun dog a nutrient-dense dog food to maximize his dietary intake.Your gun dog's food should be high in fat. Some experts recommend giving hunting dogs food with a 20% fat content.
The ideal fat content should balance omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids with a ratio between 5:1 and 10:1.
Starches and grains will not provide your dog with sufficient energy. Some grain is good for dogs, but your gun dog will need a diet rich in animal-based protein (which can be found in lean meats like chicken).
Be sure your dog has sufficient water. He will get thirsty running through the woods and fields with you, and will need clean drinking water along the way.

, Regular exercise is an important part of dog ownership, but it's particularly important for hunting dogs. In addition to your usual day-to-day walking/running exercises, you should prepare your dog for the rigors of hunting in the wilderness. If your dog has put on extra pounds during the off-season, you may need to use an accelerated training program to get your dog into hunting shape.A healthy (non-obese) dog will need approximately six to eight weeks to get in shape for hunting season.
Your dog's ability to control his breathing while sniffing for animal scents is vital for a successful hunting trip. If your dog is out of breath from running, he'll have a harder time picking up and keeping an animal's tracks.
Aerobic exercise is important for hunting dogs. If your dog is out of shape, work on exercising your dog at a slower pace over a longer workout time to optimize his endurance.
Some experts recommend using light weight training for hunting dogs during pre-season training. You can do this by attaching a small tire to your dog's harness during his walks, which will build muscles while also giving him an aerobic workout. But be careful not to overload your dog, as he can easily become injured with too much weight or too intense a workout.
Make sure your dog is well-hydrated before, during, and after his workout.

, Grooming is an important part of maintaining any dog's health and wellness. Your gun dog's grooming will depend on his breed, his coat, and the conditions in which you will be hunting.In warm summer months, you may want to have a professional groomer trim your dog's coat a little shorter. It will help keep him cool and will also allow his coat to dry faster after swimming, which can help reduce the chances of a bacterial infection forming under his wet, matted fur.
Brush your dog's coat at least once a week when he's shedding. You should also brush him after any hunting trip to remove snags and dirt, and also to check for ticks.
Keep your dog's nails trimmed to a manageable length to prevent cracked nails and injured toes.

, The place command is how you will keep your dog stationary while you hunt for game. While your dog may be used to the sit/stay commands on a flat, comfortable floor, he will need to get used to staying in one place on any kind of terrain.Create a ""place"" for your dog to sit and stay by putting a small piece of plywood over an old tire lying on its side. This will elevate the dog a few inches off the ground without making him too uncomfortable.
Use a treat to guide your dog to his small stand. Keep practicing until your dog can see you point to the stand and say ""place,"" and go there on his own.
As your dog becomes familiar with the command, add other stands around the yard. Then use the place command for surfaces that aren't flat or stable, like a park bench or a downed log.

, Remote launchers allow you to train your dog to chase, track down, and guard a downed animal. Wingers accomplish the same goals, but with a giant slingshot. You can use a dummy bird to get your dog accustomed to chasing downed birds in the wild. You can also adjust the angle and distance that the launcher fires the dummy so that your dog can train for all kinds of scenarios.You can find remote-controlled launchers and manually-operated wingers in many hunting supply stores or online. Both training tools will teach your dog to look up in the sky and out across the landscape to find falling birds.
Talk to a qualified hunting dog trainer if you're unsure of which model would work best to train your breed of gun dog.

, A good way to get your dog used to chasing a scent (or train him to do so) is to use a scent-infused training dummy. This device can be tied to a six-foot cord and dragged through tall grass or a home-made obstacle course, with treats left either at the end or along the way.Try lifting the scented dummy periodically as you drag it so that there are occasional breaks in the scent trail. This will get your dog used to looking for a scent and picking it back up when there is a gap.

, A roll cage is a specialized container made of wire. It's used to train gun dogs by placing a live raccoon inside. The dog learns to sniff out the animal, pursue it, and safely keep it in place without any risk of being bitten by the animal.This tool is primarily used to build a dog's confidence and get him accustomed to tracking and cornering prey, if he has not already been trained to do so.

, Whenever you take your gun dog into the woods for a hunting trip, you run the risk that he might be mistaken for a wild animal. He could also inadvertently enter another hunter's shot if he is not clearly visible. That's why it's best to outfit your dog with proper safety gear before heading into the field, and keeping it on your dog until you return safely home.Buy a blaze orange vest for your dog to wear at all times in the field.
Get a reflective collar for your dog. Some experts advise that breakaway-style is best for field collars.
Make sure your dog's collar has his proper identification on it. That way, if your dog becomes separated from you in the field, he can be identified and returned safely to your home.

, Depending on when and where you go hunting, your gun dog may be exposed to extreme heat or cold. Dogs are well-suited to outdoor activities, of course, but it's important to protect your dog in any weather extreme, especially if inclement weather conditions are a risk.


Dogs may need more high-calorie and high-fat food when they spend a lot of time outdoors in the cold.If at all possible, try to provide your dog with some type of shelter from the rain. Make sure he has a warm, clean blanket to burrow into when he gets back to your cabin or vehicle after a long day in cold weather.
If your dog will get wet, either from precipitation or from running into a body of water, make sure you have plenty of dry, clean towels to help him clean up at the end of the day.
Overheating and heat stroke are common issues hunting dogs face. Dogs can still experience these conditions after swimming, as getting wet doesn't necessarily lower the dog's body temperature to a safe level.
Signs of overheating include panting and/or hyperventilation, excessive salivation, glassy eyes, lack of coordination, and an altered mental state. These symptoms may also be accompanied by vomiting or diarrhea.
Pack a thermometer in your emergency kit and bring it with you in the field. Take your dog's temperature after a day of training or running/walking on a cool day so you get a baseline temperature for your dog after strenuous activity and can properly gauge his symptoms on a hot day.
If your dog experiences overheating or heat stroke in the field, you'll need to cool him down fast. Hold on to your dog and lead him into cool water, and try to keep him there. Don't let go of his collar, as he may be at risk for fainting. Apply an ice pack on the hairless part of your dog's belly and in his armpits or groin to cool him off fast, and try to get him back into an air-conditioned environment (such as your vehicle) as quickly as possible., Depending on where you live and hunt, your dog may be at risk of snakebite while out in the field. You probably don't think too much about it for your own safety, as snakes tend to flee when they sense a human's heavy footsteps approaching. But because dogs weigh less, run more, and are lower to the ground, they are significantly more at risk of being bitten by a snake than a human hunter.Carry a rattlesnake vaccine in your emergency kit any time you go hunting. Red Rock Biologics have developed a hunter-friendly vaccine kit that could save your dog's life if he's bitten in the field. These vaccine kits can be purchased online or from some outdoor gear retailers for approximately $30 to $40 per dose.
Try to stay clear of snake habitats by avoiding prairie dog colonies, old abandoned buildings, and rocky south-facing slopes in the field.
Some trainers will teach hunting dogs to stay away from snakes by exposing them to de-fanged rattlesnakes and using an electronic collar to zap the dog if he shows any interest in the snake. This type of training may be difficult to find, or it may frighten you as the dog's owner, and you should consult with your veterinarian before proceeding with such a training regimen.

, Packing some basic first aid equipment for your dog can help treat or prevent injuries and ailments in the field. You should put together a kit containing anything you might need and carry it with you whenever you go hunting.A good kit should include:


hydrogen peroxide
a sterile saline rinse
non-stick gauze pads
a gauze wrap
non-stick adhesive tape
a rectal thermometer
tweezers and a magnifying glass
an instant cold pack (one that can be activated by squeezing/cracking the pack's contents)
a splint
antihistamines (such as Benadryl)
aspirin (and only aspirin - do not give your dog acetaminophen or ibuprofen)
an antibiotic ointment
cortisone cream
snakebite anti-venom

sufficient food and water, plus bowls

, There are limits to what you can do for an injured dog in the field, but knowing basic canine first aid can help treat your dog's wounds (if he experiences any) until you can get him home or to a vet. You'll need to evaluate your dog's wounds to decide whether or not they are life threatening, but some experts recommend taking any and all wounds seriously and treating them in the field as best you can.Cuts or gashes will bleed, but puncture wounds may not bleed very much. Check your dog's paw pads and the skin between his toes, and remove any mud or woody debris that may have gotten lodged in there.
Flush minor wounds with a saline wash designed to irrigate wounds. This can help remove dirt and unseen debris or bacteria. Antiseptic or antibacterial washes may also be helpful for cleaning wounds in the field.
If your dog is bleeding extensively, you may need to act fast. Don't worry about cleaning the wound until you stop the flow of blood. Use gauze to soak up some of the blood and keep pressure on the wound to control the bleeding. When the wound is manageable, use gauze and tape to secure the wound and get your dog to a vet immediately.

, You should check your dog (and yourself) for ticks after any time spent in the field. Ticks can transmit Lyme disease and other infections, even to dogs. It may be difficult to find ticks on a dog's fur-covered body, so extra vigilance is required to keep your dog safe.Run your fingers across your dog's entire body. Any bump or swollen area could indicate a burrowed tick.
After you check your dog's torso for ticks you should also inspect his face and chin, inside/under his ears, under his armpits, and between his toes.
Learn how to identify ticks. They are arachnids, meaning they will always have eight legs. They can be black, brown, or tan, and may be tremendously tiny or noticeably bloated (depending on age, species, and how recently they've fed).
Ticks can be active year-round in some climates. Always check yourself and your dog for ticks after spending time outdoors.
If you find a tick, use tweezers to remove it. Grasp the tick's head as close to your dog's skin as possible. Use care when grabbing the tick so you do not injure your dog's skin or break off the tick's head. Then use a slow, straight motion to pull the tick outward. Make sure the entire tick has been removed intact, including the head, to prevent infection and Lyme disease.
If you found and removed a tick, save it in a small container full of isopropyl alcohol. Write the date you found/removed the tick on its container and keep it to show your vet if your dog begins to have symptoms of a tick-borne illness. Look for arthritis/lameness lasting three to four days, inability or reluctance to move, swollen joints, fever, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, and a loss of appetite.

, Your dog may experience osteoarthritis due to age, breed, or repeated hunting seasons. This can cause pain that could limit your dog's mobility. To reduce arthritis pain, feed your dog a diet rich in Omega-3 fatty acids, and try using supplements like glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate. More advanced/severe arthritis may require prescription medications from your veterinarian.If your dog has arthritis, make sure he has a warm, soft dog bed (or human bed!) to sleep in at night. This can help reduce pain and keep him comfortable after a long day in the field.

You can also try calling the office first to avoid wasting time. If the office has a list, either visit the office personally, or have them email or fax you a list of reputable Lowchen breeders or referrals.You can say, ""Hello, my name is James. I am interested in owning a Lowchen puppy. Does your office have a list of reputable breeders or referrals I can contact for Lowchen puppies?"";
, The websites of dog breed clubs often have a list of breeders or a list of referrals for you to contact. Referrals are not breeders themselves, but can refer you to breeders in your area.For example, visit the websites of the AKC and The Lowchen Club of America to search for referrals.
When calling a referral, these individuals are often volunteers that have been appointed by their clubs. Referrals may take a few days to get back to you, so try to be patient., Visit the AKC website or a show’s superintendent website, for example infodog.com, to find out show dates and times. In the website, click the schedule section/judging program section to see what time the breed you are interested in will be showing, and in which ring.You can say, for example, ""Hi, my name is John. I am interested in owning a Lowchen. Would you be able to refer me to a responsible breeder?""
When approaching the breeder, do not approach them ringside, or 20 minutes before they enter the ring. Wait until they are finished showing their dog, then approach them a few minutes afterwards.Some dog shows have a designated “Meet the Breed” area, where you can interact with the breed and meet the owner.

, Make a list of at least four breeders you would like to contact. When contacting the breeder, give a brief introduction. Ask the breeder if they have puppies available. If they do not, you can either ask to be put on a list, or tell them that you will call back once you looked into other breeders.You can say, “Hi, I’m Jessica, my partner and I have two kids, and we are looking for the perfect Lowchen for our family.

This way, you will have enough time to drive to the breeder, visit the puppies, and drive back home.

, Like humans, Lowchen’s have different personalities and temperaments. Upon meeting the breeder, let them know about your daily activities and what kind of person you are. This way, they can match you with a Lowchen that has a similar personality.Are you active? A homebody? A social person who has people over a lot? Do you have children? These are important questions to ask yourself in order to help the breeder make the perfect match between you and your Lowchen.

, Upon arriving at the breeder’s home, inspect the areas the puppies spend their time in for cleanliness and spaciousness. Make sure the breeder treats the puppies like a responsible pet owner would. If the puppies seem crowded or confined to one space or cages, this is not a sign of a reputable breeder.Is it clean and odor free? If not, keep your options open.

, Puppies should be clean, well fed, friendly, and lively. Signs of malnutrition are protruding rib cages, illness, runny noses and eyes, coughing, lethargy, and skin sores.The breeder should provide the puppies with toys, socialization, and exercise. You can ask, “How often do you take the puppies outside?” “Do you separate the puppies or keep them together?” and “What kind of enrichment do you provide specifically for the Lowchen breed?”
If the puppies seem scared or aggressive when interacting with you, these are possible signs that a puppy has been mistreated.A reputable breeder will encourage you to meet and spend time with the puppy’s mother.

, Once you have examined the puppies, take one aside to see how it interacts with humans without other puppies around. Examine the puppy for fearful behavior and a general lack of socialization, such as extreme shyness, aggression, and anxiety. If the puppy displays this behavior, then pick another puppy.If all the puppies seem fearful of humans, these are possible signs that the puppies came from a puppy mill.
Healthy puppies are playful, curious, and they will want to interact with you.

, A responsible breeder will encourage you to make multiple visits. They will want you to take your time to make a decision about purchasing and owning a puppy. They will also want you to bring the whole family to meet the puppy.Let other family members interact with the puppies individually. This way, you and your family can come to consensus about which puppy you like the most and want to bring home.

, You should get a sense that the breeder genuinely cares for the puppies. A breeder that genuinely cares about the puppies will make sure they are going to a good home, will be knowledgeable about the breed, and express concern about the puppies.A reputable breeder will offer guidance in the training and caring of your puppy. They will also provide you with their contact information in case you need assistance during any stage of your puppy’s development.

, Breeders should be willing to show proof of health screenings through OFA and CERF certificates. You can also ask for documentation verifying the mother and father’s breed.A reputable breeder will be open about potential genetic and developmental problems inherent to the breed. The breeder should be able to show documents indicating that the puppy’s parents and grandparents have been professionally evaluated to breed these problems out of their puppies.A reputable breeder will be able to provide you with veterinary records indicating that the puppies have had initial deworming and vaccinations.
A reputable breeder will provide references from other families who have purchased puppies from them.

, A reputable breeder will require you to sign a contract. The contract may have various sections verifying that you provided proof that you are allowed to have a dog (if you live in an apartment or condominium), that you will spay or neuter the dog, and that you will return the dog to the breeder if you are unable to care for the dog.A reputable breeder will also want you to explain why you want the dog, who will be responsible for the puppy’s training and care, where the dog will be spending most of its time, and what rules have been decided for the puppy.

Consider the breed's hunting instinct.,
Be aware that training can be a challenge.Shibas are highly intelligent dogs, but unlike other breeds, they often use their intelligence to their own ends, to get one up on their owner.,
Know that this is an independent breed.Shiba Inus have a reputation for being more like a cat than a dog.,
Reconsider the breed if you want a cuddly dog.Most Shiba Inus are very particular about their bodies.,
Beware the Shiba Inu's reputation for aggressive reactions.,
Consider whether you want a male or female.Anecdotally, male Shiba Inus are typically more playful and interactive than females.,
Be prepared for coat maintenance.While most Shiba Inus don't shed year-round, they shed consistently in the spring and fall for a couple of months at a time.,
Think about the breed's predicted life span and health concerns.,
Don’t overlook their character strengths.",How to Choose a Shiba Inu Puppy1," Shiba Inus were originally bred as hunting dogs who flushed out small game (birds) and occasionally larger, more dangerous game (wild boars).However, today, they are primarily owned as loyal companion animals, not hunting partners. Still, despite the Shiba Inu's small size (Shibas weigh in at between 17 and 23 lbs.), it is a strong and bold dog with a strong prey instinct.Shibas are known to escape fencing or run away off-leash if they see something they want to chase. They are agile and stronger than they look, so they will need obedience training.;
, Some owners report that their dog seems to ""plot"" and devise ways to outwit them or to overcome restrictions or training. In short, the Shiba Inu is not always an easy dog to train. However, if you have experience with dogs and are looking for a challenge, training a Shiba can be a fulfilling experience. Watching how they put their sharp minds to use can be a delight.


The ideal Shiba owner has a lot of patience and plenty of time to devote to training. The breed has working origins, and this energy is often directed in destructive ways by bored dogs. Be ready to train the dog not to chew through possessions or escape from enclosed yards.
Keep in mind that, just like people, there are always individual dogs that break generalizations. Some Shibas are compliant and fit in easily.

, They are content in their own company and independent minded. This lack of motivation to please people can also make training more challenging, as they don't need the reward of human attention as much as some other breeds.


The breed's independent spirit is a beloved trait among Shiba owners. These are not slavish dogs who fawn over people, but dogs who project an aura of dignity and composure., They can be ""drama queens,"" in that they overreact to the minor health problems. Even with minor pain, they can release a particularly piercing scream. Beyond a pain response, though, many Shibas don't like being touched or lifted up, and most won't curl up on the couch with you to cuddle like some breeds will.


Shibas are a good option for owners who don't want the constant body contact you might get from cuddlier breeds. A Shiba Inu will be loyal and loving without crowding your physical space.

, As stated, Shibas prefer to be left alone physically, and they have a tendency to be aggressive and bite if their personal boundaries are overstepped. Thus, they are not the best breed to have with young children. They also tend not to tolerate other pets well, and are known to chase and herd dogs they perceive as weaker than they are.They tend to be possessive with their belongings and food, and will need to be monitored, especially if other pets or small children are in the household.

, Females tend to be more laid back and less attention seeking than their male counterparts. Choose the sex that aligns more closely with what you want from your pet.

, Be prepared for a snowstorm of hair at these times. They have a dense double coat; you'll want to brush weekly in order to spread its natural oils and keep the top coat in good order. If you're willing to put in a little effort and put up with some shedding, you can enjoy a Shiba's gorgeous coat.

, Shiba Inus have a general lifespan of about 12 to 15 years.One of the biggest health concerns for Shiba Inus is chronic allergies, which result in extreme itchiness. There is no cure for allergic conditions, but they can be controlled. Treatments, however, can be costly. They also are prone to develop hypothyroidism and cataracts. While Shibas have been known to have hip dysplasia, they aren't as subject to this as some larger breeds. It is also thought that the Shiba Inu has a higher incidence of seizures and epilepsy that the average dog. If you're considering the breed, make sure you can afford to care for your pet should these problems develop.

, The list of traits gathered here might look negative, but they are only intended to warn the uninformed about potential problems. Shiba Inus have strong personalities, and are extremely loyal companions when they bond with their owners. Fans of the breed are completely smitten with them.

Review the dog's pedigree and health history.,
Recognize common min pin diseases and disorders.,
Assess the min pin’s health.,
Evaluate the dog based on breed standard.,
Look for common min pin behaviors.,
Spend time with the dog.",How to Choose a Minpin1," While the health and behaviors of the parents and their past litters does not necessarily indicate that your puppy will be sickly or poorly behaved, a dog’s pedigree that includes numerous health or behavioral concerns may raise a red flag. When this occurs, you may want to look for a different breeder or breeding pair.


Ask to spend time with both the dam (mother) and the sire (father). If at all possible, ask to spend time with puppies from past litters as well. If the parents and siblings are happy and healthy, you are more likely to get a healthy puppy.
Review the parents’ health reports and at least three generations of pedigrees. Look for causes and ages of death and any major health concerns.
Ask about the personality of the parents. You’ll want to know things like how they interact with other dogs and people. Find out if the dog has ever bitten a person, or if they frequently fight with other animals. Parents that bark a lot or escape frequently may also be warning signs.;
, In general, the miniature pinscher is a healthy dog with few medical issues. Know the most common diseases among miniature pinchers and their warning signs. Look for these when assessing the dog. Ask about testing for these concerns in parents and puppies to ensure you select a healthy dog.


Entropion is an eye disorder. The dog's lashes irritate the eye causing infection and other serious health concerns.
Progressive retinal degeneration (PRA) destroys the nerve cells at the back of the eye and can cause blindness.
Corneal dystrophy occurs in both eyes, and dogs usually inherit this disease from one of their parents. It leads to inflammation in the cornea, and has been linked to a number of chronic and systemic illnesses.
Glaucoma is a disease that effects both humans and dogs. It occurs when pressure in the eye socket continually increases. In most cases, glaucoma leads to blindness., Ask the breeder, pet shop, or pet adoption facility for the dog’s health history. This should include the vaccination and worming schedule, so you know when they are due to be updated. If the pet has experienced any health concerns in the past, these should be included in the report as well as treatments that were administered., The American Kennel Club and the Miniature Pinscher Club of America both outline the average height, weight, coat type, and other breed standards for min pins. While these are not necessarily of utmost importance when choosing a pet, min pins that are far outside the standard may be crossbred, sick, or present health issues down the line.


The average height of a full-grown min pin from shoulder to ground is between 10 and 12.5 inches.
The min pin’s length should be equal to its height at the shoulder. Females tend to be slightly longer than they are tall.
The coat should be short, smooth, sleek, and hard. The AKC accepts coat colors of red, stag red (black intermingled), black and tan, black and rust, chocolate and tan, and chocolate and rust., Min pins are typically very energetic, intelligent, curious about new stimuli, and confident approaching other dogs and humans. If one of the puppies appears to be shying away from all the other dogs or hides when you arrive, this is a sign the dog may not be very well socialized. If you have a lot of time to spend with your new puppy, these skittish puppies can be socialized. Escaping is one of the most problematic behaviors min pins exhibit. If the dogs are in a pen, look for dogs who are trying to find ways to get out of their enclosure., The most important thing you can do before picking a dog isn’t making sure it’s AKC approved. It’s making sure the min pin is the right fit for you. Dogs that show energy, seem willing to play, and who do not cower or shy away from you are typically good picks, but you never know how they will behave at home. Most breeders and pet stores have a trial period allowance. During this time, you're able to take the dog home with you for a few days or even weeks, but you still have an option to return the puppy, if it is not the right fit. Take advantage of this. It lets you get to know the min pin and how it will fit into your home."

Look for a trustworthy breeder.,
Know the hallmarks of untrustworthy Shiba Inu breeders.,
Assess each puppy's health.,
Evaluate the parents' appearance.",How to Choose a Shiba Inu Puppy2," A good breeder will allow you to see all puppies and dogs at any time. They should be happy to have you look round, and indeed be proud of their facilities. They should also have a return policy — a breeder who won't let you to return a puppy for any reason isn't taking responsibility for the animals they breed. A responsible breeder also won't breed an excessive amount of litters in a year's time.


Make sure the mother is up to date with her vaccinations, and that the puppies started their routine parasite treatments at 4 weeks of age.Search the American Kennel Club's ""classifieds"" for Shiba Inus available from AKC-approved breeders near you., In general, you should stay away from breeders who adopt out puppies before 8 weeks of age. Puppies under this age are too young to be safely weaned from their mothers, and no responsible breeder would attempt it.Kennel conditions that are dirty or too crowded can also be signs of poor breeding practices and standards.


Rule out a breeder who can't provide you with health check information on his puppies.
Likewise, if you are not able to see the mother, walk away. No matter how legitimate an explanation they furnish about why she's not available, don't get taken in. This is a classic ploy of shifty breeders and puppy mills. Buying a puppy from them only encourages their immoral trade.

, Even if you're dealing with a reputable breeder, you need to be on the lookout for sickly or otherwise unhealthy puppies. The main physical characteristics you need to assess are:Energy: the puppy should not appear sluggish, but alert and high-energy
Clear eyes and nostrils: there should be no discharge or crust around them
Breathing: the puppy should not cough or sneeze excessively, and breathing should be quiet
Cleanliness: the puppy should have a clean genital area, with no fecal matter or pus visible or smell
Weight: the puppy should be rounded with baby fat over the ribcage
Coat: the coat should be clean and glossy, with no dullness or dandruff. Greasiness or bald patches are a warning sign.
Hearing: clap your hands behind the puppies head to make sure it reacts and turns toward the sound
Vision: roll a ball slowly near the puppy (within its field of vision) to make sure it notices the movement
Legs: observe the puppy's walking and running for signs of limping, stiffness, or soreness

, Especially if you're choosing a puppy you plan to show, it's important your puppy adhere to breed standards. It can be hard to tell how a puppy will develop as it grows, but its parents will give you an idea of what the puppy will look like as an adult. A partial summary of AKC standards for Shiba Inus includes:Size: Males stand 14.5-16.5"" at the withers and weigh about 23 lbs. Females stand 13.5-15.5"" and weigh about 17 lbs.
Head: Shibas should have a confident gaze with dark brown irises rimmed with black. The forehead is broad, flat, and slightly furrowed, and the muzzle's bridge is straight. There should be no over- or underbite in the teeth.
Body: The back is level from the base of the neck to the tail. The body is well-muscled, with a chest depth (from withers to lowest point of the sternum) of half or slightly less than the dog's height from withers to the ground. The tail should have a single, not a double, curl.
Coat: the only acceptable colors are red, sesame, or black.The outer coat is stiff and straight, while the undercoat is soft and thick.
Dogs with over or underbites, males over 16.5"" or under 14.5"", and females over 15.5"" or under 13.5"" are disqualified from showing.

Examine the litter as a whole.When picking out a puppy, it's important to see the whole litter and assess how the puppies interact with each other.,
Don't get distracted by how cute the puppy is.,
Look for a puppy who is naturally curious about people.,
Make sure the puppy is well-socialized.Socialization is the process of exposing puppies to all manner of different experiences from 3 weeks of age up to 18 weeks.,
Test his trainability.,
Perform a simple test for aggression.Roll the puppy onto his back and gently hold him in that position.",How to Choose a Shiba Inu Puppy3," Shiba Inu puppies should be curious and unafraid of people. Look, too, for good play interaction between puppies, and avoid considering puppies that are shy and skittish. In general, a puppy with a temperament that is neither too aggressive nor too shy is a good pick.


In particular for the Shiba Inu breed, aggressive, bullying puppies have the potential to become aggressive adults.

, Baby Shiba Inus can look like little teddy bears. However, don't let their appearance distract you from the task of assessing personality.

, Make a mental note of whether he approaches you of his own accord, and how long he then spends with you. This helps you know how friendly he is and how much he enjoys human company.

, What the puppy encounters at this age, he learns to accept, and this makes a well-adjusted, confident puppy. Socialization is critical for any puppy, but more so for Shibas. They have a strong personality and are prone to expressing their own opinion. The last thing you want is a fearful or anxious dog that may use its nervous energy for destruction.


Puppies should have, at minimum, 1.5 hours of human interaction per day.
Ideally, choose a puppy that’s been raised within the home/ house, rather than in a kennel. This is beneficial because the puppies are exposed to the regular sights, sounds, and smells of domestic life from the beginning of their lives.
Puppies raised in outdoor kennels are more isolated from normal life. Given the Shiba Inu's tendency to be independent, the breeder must work hard to make sure the puppies are well socialized.

, Though it's hard to tell how a dog is going to be when it grows up, you can get a little sense of it even at this young age. Offer him a toy to play with, then see how easy or hard it is to take it back. Perhaps try offering him a treat in exchange for the toy. This helps you know how he might respond to training, or whether you'd have a battle on your hands.

, While there's some disagreement about the usefulness of this test, many experts have used it as a predictor of how aggressive the puppy will be as an adult. If the dog growls and tries to fight you off, it's possible he's more likely to become aggressive. If he lays there completely passive, (unlikely in a Shiba!) then he's likely to be overly submissive. A healthy reaction is somewhere in between, where the puppy wriggles trying to right himself but doesn't growl or snap.

Check online.,
Ask a local veterinarian.,
Call or email a breeder.,
Visit a potential breeder.,
Ask pet stores for breeder information.,
Consider adoption.",How to Choose a Minpin2," Visit the American Kennel Club (or the similar organization in your home country) to review a list of reputable breeders. The AKC offers accurate information about finding a trustworthy breeder, buying a healthy puppy, and how to plan for your dog’s ongoing care.You can also check with the Miniature Pinscher Club of America. This organization offers invaluable information about local breeders, min pin rescue organizations, and reputable retail locations to purchase a min pin.Many breeders also have their own websites. Check these for information about current and past litters.
If a breeder has an online presence, they may also have reviews online from customers that could be informative.
Check social media of local breeders as well. These sites often have unfiltered feedback from past buyers, photos of past litters, and other information that may prove helpful.

, You’ll need to establish a relationship with a vet prior to bringing home your new min pin, so seeking advice from your local veterinary practice is a beneficial starting place. A breeder who has a good relationship with a veterinarian is already a good sign, since this means they bring puppies in for treatment. If a vet believes the breeder is adequately caring for and raising healthy dogs, they are likely a safe bet.


If you already have a vet who treats other animals in your household, start there. If you don’t have a vet, it’s good to find one before you get a new pet. Ask friends and family members for recommendations, read online reviews, and visit the veterinary practices to ensure you choose a safe practice for your new pet., This is a good first step before deciding to buy from a breeder or even wasting time visiting them. The initial contact is a great opportunity to build rapport with a breeder, gather information about their policies, and start to gauge whether they are reputable. Take time to ask questions that will give you basic information about the breeder’s practices.


Ask how many litters the breeder produces each year. Breeders who are constantly producing litters may be what is referred to as a “puppy mill.” This is a breeder who forces dogs to mate too frequently, which may produce weak or unhealthy puppies.
Ask how many dogs the breeder has and how many are being bred. This is a red flag if breeders have more than two or three breeding pairs of dogs at a time.
Ask how often the dams (females) are bred. Reputable breeders shouldn’t push their dams to carry litters more than two or three times each year., Once you’ve had a chance to speak with breeders and have a few you would feel comfortable buying from, ask to visit their facility. A reputable breeder should be happy to show you around, allow you to spend time with the parent dogs, and interact with any current litters of puppies. Good min pin breeders are usually proud to talk about their dogs and litters.

, Many pet stores purchase their supply of puppies from “puppy mills.” These breeders are constantly mating dogs and often don’t allow them to rest between litters. If you wouldn’t buy a dog from a breeder without information about the health, personality, and pedigree of the parents, you shouldn’t accept this from a pet store either.


If your pet store buys from reputable breeders, they will provide information for you about where the puppies were bred, and in most cases, contact information so you can contact the breeder directly.
If the pet store doesn’t provide information on the dog’s and parent’s healthy history, pedigree, and breeder, don’t buy pets from that store., There are numerous miniature pinschers bred each year who need good homes, but for any number of reasons are not housed. That’s why adoption is so important. Rescuing an adult or puppy is also a great way to get a min pin at an affordable price. Purebred min pins can cost between $400 and $700, but rescues typically cost between $50 and $100 from shelters or a small rehousing fee from other rescues.

Consider your space.,
Plan for care.,
Bring a min pin home for a trial.",How to Choose a Minpin3," The miniature pinscher is the perfect choice if you live in an apartment. These small dogs can get adequate activity in the house and with a few walks a day. If left alone in the fenced yard, make sure it is secure since the min pin may try to escape., The miniature pinscher is highly intelligent and it learns very quickly. Without proper training as a puppy, the min pin can become stubborn, but with persistence, even older dogs who try to assert dominance and resist training can be trained. As long as you take the time to interact with and integrate your min pin into the home, they are wonderful, highly entertaining pets.


Don’t leave a min pin alone with nothing to do. They're intelligent dogs and need mental stimulation to prevent destructive behavior.
Protect your min pin from cold. Because of their small size and short coat, min pins are sensitive to cold weather. Plan to keep them mostly indoors during cold weather. Try a dog sweater or coat on them during winter when they are outdoors., Whether this is your first dog or your 50th, you never really know how you’ll bond with your new pet. For this reason, most breeders and retailers have a return policy. The goal is to make sure you have the right dog for your home and family, and that the dogs are able to find a home where they’ll be safe and happy. Take advantage of these policies if you need to."

Ask at local animal shelters.",How to Check Dog Breed Bans1," Some sites on the internet pull the laws for an area altogether in one place. Then you can look up your city and state, for instance, to see if your area has a dog ban on certain breeds. Keep in mind, though, that these sites aren't always up-to-date, so it's best to check them against your local government's websites., Some U.S. states have state-wide bans on certain breeds, so begin by checking the laws on your state government's website. However, you can't stop there, as some laws are enacted on the county or city level, so check on those websites, as well, for breed-specific bans.If you don't want to use the internet, you can call your local offices.

, Animal control is generally responsible for picking up animals in your area. As such, they are usually up-to-date on what breeds are banned because they are tasked with picking them up. Find the number to your local animal control online and call them for more information.

, If you can't find the information online, your local animal shelter will often know the laws in the area, and you can ask them which breeds are banned in your city. Similarly, local vets will usually have this information as well."

If your child wants to play with the animal, make sure that they do it where you can watch them. This way you can quickly intervene and stop your child from harming the dog. It also makes it easier for you to provide teachable moments about proper pet care.Make it a rule that the kids can only play with the dog in the living room or backyard so that you can keep an eye on them.;
, To ensure that your child and dog do not have a bad interaction, you should teach your child about how to interact with the dog. Because toy dogs are already particularly anxious dogs, you should instruct your child to avoid approaching the dog from behind or hovering over it. This increases the dog’s anxiety levels and the likelihood that it may hurt itself. It also increases the likelihood of the dog biting the child.In order to maintain your dog’s health, it is important that your children not startle or scare your toy dog. High anxiety can lead increased illness for your dog.
For example, your child may scare the dog, causing it to jump and hurt itself.

, Because of their small size, toy dogs can sometimes go unnoticed. If they are not watching where they are going, your child can easily trample the dog. They might also hit it with a swinging door or drop things on it. Remind your children that they should look down and always have an idea of where the dog is located.Ask your children to not run in the house or swing any doors. This will help keep them from inadvertently hurting the dog.

, Many children, particularly when they are young, have a hard time gently showing affection. They often cause dogs pain by squeezing, pinching, hitting, and poking their pet. Younger children often have no idea that they are hurting the animals. With toy dogs, young children can seriously hurt a dog or cause it to bite them.Toy dogs are not ideal for children. They are often territorial and anxious, which make them a bad match for rambunctious and intrusive children. Talk to your veterinarian if you are thinking about a toy dog for your child.

, Teach your older children to be gentle with your toy dog by demonstrating how to properly hold and pet the dog. Inform your children that hard pats can easily frighten the dog and even injure it. Instead, tell them to gently caress the dog and give it soft touches.Teaching gentle touching will also ensure that your children are not bitten.

, Although they are small, you will need to remind your children that the toy dog is not actually a toy. They need to be gentle when playing with the dog to avoid hurting it. Any kind of rough play could severely injure the dog.Toy dogs can easily suffer fractures and broken bones from seemingly simple accidents. You child’s weight alone could easily crush some small dogs.
Toy dogs can play many games like fetch and tug of war. However, the child should scale back the intensity of play because of the dog’s small size.

, Your children need to be mindful about playing with the dog in safe places. It is important to avoid playing with the dog in places where it might fall or become stuck. For example, because it might fall and hurt itself, the top bed of a bunkbed is not a safe place to play with a toy dog.

, Toys that are too large for your dog can be very dangerous to them. Large thrown toys can easily injure your dog. Make sure that your child knows to use appropriate sized toys when playing with the toy dog.For example, if your child wants to play catch with the dog, make sure that they are using an appropriately sized toy. A large ball or stick could injure the animal.

, Small dogs can easily overexert themselves with physical activity. This can lead to illness or injury. To avoid this, instruct your children to limit the amount of vigorous activity they participate in with the dog. Although toy dogs can mostly enjoy the same activities as larger dogs, exercise should be less frequent and for shorter periods of time.A toy dog only needs about 30 minutes of exercise a day.
For example, small dogs cannot go on as long of walks as larger dogs. Your toy dog will quickly get tired.
For a toy dog, your living room is a veritable playground.

, When caring for a toy dog, it is easy to give them too much food. They do not need nearly as much as a larger dog. A seemingly minuscule amount of food will suffice. Talk with your veterinarian about how much to properly feed your toy dog.For most dogs under 5 pounds (2.26 kg), a half cup (120 ml) of dog food each day should be enough.

, When grooming your dog, it is important to be gentle. Brushing too hard or scrubbing too vigorously can hurt your small dog. Show your children how to wash your toy dog softly and how to brush its hair gently.Small dogs can also get cold quickly if they are wet for a long time. Make sure that your children know to dry off your dog quickly if they bathe it.

, Because they are small, toy dogs also get cold easily. If you child takes the dog out during the winter, make sure that they take a sweater or some kind of clothing for your dog. In the summer, smaller dogs are also susceptible to overheating. Make sure that your children know to provide your toy dog with plenty of shared and lots of water.In general, smaller dogs should not spend much time outside. Let your children know that your toy dog needs to spend most of its time indoors.

, Because many toy breeds cannot walk very far, many people carry them in carriers. Teach your child to carry the toy dog’s carrier properly to avoid injuring it. Make sure that they know to not swing the carrier around or drop it while the dog is inside. Being careless or rough with the carrier while the dog is inside can seriously injure the animal., Because they can become physically exhausted so easily, you will likely want to keep your dog in its bag when you are in public. This will also keep your small dog from being injured by children or other animals. Keeping your dog in its bag also ensures that the any children who want to see your dog have to approach you before gaining access.

, If your small dog is skittish, you should let children know that they should leave it alone when you are in public. When children approach your dog, do not let them play with it unsolicited. Let them know that your dog is delicate and that they need your approval to play with it.


Say something like “Please do not touch the dog” or “You can play with the dog but you have to be gentle.”

, When you are at a park, you can also let your dog dictate who touches it. You can monitor your dog and see whom it approaches. If it your dog goes near some children, keep a close eye on the situation. You can even let the children know that they need to be careful handling your dog.


Say something like “Please do not pick up my dog” or “Be gentle when you touch the dog.”

, If the children will not listen to you, pick up your dog and leave. Because of its small stature, the children could easily injure your dog. They may also make it extremely anxious and cause it psychological distress. Take your dog away from any situations that you feel are not safe.


Say things like “If you are not going to play nice, we’re going to leave” or “Be nice to the dog or we’re leaving.”

Commit to training your Yorkipoo.,
Socialize your Yorkipoo.,
Use reward-based training.,
Teach your dog basic commands.,
Talk with the breeder about your Yorkipoo's health.,
Get your dog regular veterinary care.,
Get your dog used to teeth brushing.,
Get professional dental care.,
Be aware of potential health problems.,
Choose a high-quality food.,
Offer treats sparingly.,
Groom your dog's coat.,
Trim your Yorkipoo's nails.",How to Care for Yorkipoos," Start training your Yorkipoo as soon as you get your dog. You'll need to spend the time teaching your Yorkipoo house rules (like where to toilet), as well as any behavioral rules that are important to you (like no jumping on people). If you don't think you'll have time to train during the first three to six months that you own your Yorkipoo, rethink your decision to adopt one.


One animal shelter study showed that 21% of the people surrendering their dogs gave them up because of the time, money, and effort required. The biggest reason dogs end up in animal shelters is because of bad behavior.;
, Take your Yorkipoo on car rides, visits to parks, and short walks around the neighborhood. Just make sure he's had his first set of vaccinations before exposing him to others. He should interact with men, women and children in a positive way so he isn’t scared of a certain sex or size of people.


You may want to enroll your Yorkipoo in an obedience training or puppy socialization class. Ask your veterinarian or local pet store to recommend one.
Avoid bringing home a Yorkipoo if you have very young children. This is more to protect your Yorkipoo, which can be accidentally injured because of his small size., One of the best ways to teach basic commands is to use the reward-based training system. To do so, reward your dog when he obeys the command or makes a move in the right direction. Try offering a small food reward for obedience. Make sure you're consistent in your expectations and rewards. Never reward bad behavior.


Don't forget that verbal praise is also a reward for your dog., You'll probably want your dog to respond to simple commands like ""stay"", ""sit"", or ""down"". Choose a training time when you have your Yorkipoo's full attention. Show your dog a treat, work with him while stating the command, and immediately reward obedience or positive efforts.For example, to teach your dog how to sit have him stand in front of you. Make sure he's paying attention and sees that you have a treat between your fingers. Once he focuses on the treat, hold it a few inches above his head and slowly move it back between his ears. He'll naturally follow it back and begin to sit. Tell him to ""sit"" as he does this and immediately give him the treat, saying ""good, sit"" at the same time.

, Make sure your Yorkipoo's breeder has had your Yorkipoo examined by a veterinarian at six weeks of age. Your Yorkipoo should also already have his first distemper shot and a dewormer to kill internal parasites.Ask for a bill or invoice from the veterinarian to ensure these were done and always work with a reputable dog breeder.

, Your Yorkipoo will need another dose of dewormer two weeks after his initial treatment. This will kill any residual worms. Your Yorkipoo will also need a distemper booster 3 to 4 weeks after the initial distemper shot. If your dog is over a year old, he'll need an annual exam and vaccine booster. Once he's 10 years of age, he'll need two exams a year. If your Yorkipoo is a puppy, make sure to follow this veterinary schedule:8 weeks of age: Heartworm preventative (then once a month during heartworm season or depending on your veterinarian's recommendation)
9 weeks of age: Lyme vaccine
12 weeks of age: Lyme booster, Rabies vaccine
6 months of age: Spay or neuter

, Place a small bit of dog toothpaste on your finger and let him lick it off. Place a little toothpaste on the toothbrush and wipe it along his gums. Once he's comfortable with that, place some toothpaste on the brush and rub it along the gums and outer surfaces of the outer teeth. Work your way up to being able to brush the outer surfaces of all the teeth.You don’t need to try to brush the inner teeth since most plaque attacks the outer teeth.

, The veterinarian will check your Yorkipoo's teeth at his annual exam. Even with daily brushing, your Yorkipoo may need a professional cleaning to remove bacteria and plaque which collects under the gums. Consider taking your Yorkipoo for a professional cleaning once every year or so.When you brush your Yorkipoo's teeth, always check for any sores, growths in the mouth, or loose teeth. If you find any, take your dog to the vet for an exam.

, Since the Yorkipoo is a mixed breed, he's susceptible to the same health problems which affect Yorkie and Poodle breeds. Discuss any health concerns with the veterinarian. Keep in mind that your Yorkipoo may be prone to the following:Dental problems: Gum disease and bad breath are common since it's difficult to clean inside the Yorkipoo's tiny mouth.
Injuries: Mishandling a Yorkipoo can cause injury because the dog is so tiny. Watch him around small children or larger dogs. Keep your Yorkipoo on a leash and by your side when you're out.
Patellar (kneecap) luxation: The kneecap slips out of place in varying degrees. Some dogs are mildly affected while others are crippled and need surgery.
Collapsing trachea: The trachea collapses in varying degrees. This is usually caused by pressure from pulling on collars.
Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: A problem with blood supply to the thigh bone where it meets the pelvis can cause limping and muscle atrophy. Surgery can treat this disease.

, Purchase a commercial dog food that lists meat as one of the first two ingredients on the nutrition label. Avoid products that are full of meat by-products or filler. Since Yorkipoo's are known for having dental problems, look for a food that's formulated to grind plaque and bacteria off the teeth. You can also ask your veterinarian to recommend the right food for your Yorkipoo.


Always offer your dog fresh, clean water throughout the day.
If you'd like to make your own dog food, consider developing a diet with an animal nutrition professional. This ensures that your dog is getting a balanced diet with all the nutrients he needs., To keep your Yorkipoo a healthy weight, keep snacks to a minimum. When you do want to reward your dog, give him a few pieces of his normal dog food (especially dental foods), low-calorie dog treats, baby carrots, or a few low-sodium canned green beans. Keep in mind there are some human foods that you should never your Yorkipoo since they can make your dog sick or can kill him. Avoid giving your dog:Alcohol
Avocados
Chocolate
Grapes and raisins
Macadamia nuts
Fatty meat scraps
Cooked bones or chicken bones in general
Onions, garlic and chives
Yeast dough
Xylitol (found in sugar-free foods, including some peanut butters)

, Your Yorkipoo's coat will depend on whether he takes after his Poodle or Yorkie parent. Brush your dog's coat at least once a week to keep his fur clear of tangles and mats.If he takes after his poodle parent, you'll probably need to take him to a professional groomer every 4 to 6 weeks for a proper trim.


Don't forget to check your dog's coat for fleas, ticks, lumps, bumps, cysts, scabs, scratches, or redness. Treat your dog for any fleas or ticks. Monitor any skin irritation and contact the vet if you're concerned.

, Look at your dog's nails every week to see if they're getting long. You'll probably only need to clip them once or twice a month.If they need trimming, clip just the tips. Take care to avoid cutting the quick (the part of the nail where blood vessels and sensitive nerves grow).


The quick appears as a pink triangle on white nails. It may be harder to find on dark nails, so ask a veterinary technician to show you how to trim dark nails.

Choose a Shihpoo if you are single, a senior, or have children.,
Consider a Shihpoo if you want a low exercise level dog.,
Be aware the Shihpoo is not hypoallergenic.,
Know that a Shihpoo may be difficult to house train.",How to Care for Shihpoos1," Both the Shih Tzu's and the poodle's good nature means the Shihpoo is likely to make a good dog for first time owners.The breed is very adaptable, affectionate, and social.;
, Shihpoos are extremely affectionate dogs. They love to cuddle and make good lap dogs. They are usually very accepting of strangers, though some dogs might be shier than others. Most Shihpoos want to sleep with their owners at night., The Shihpoo loves the comfort of the home. His small size means he adapts well to apartment living. He is very friendly with others, so he will do well if you are around other people where you live.He adapts well to any living situation, and can be content running around a yard or living room.


Shihpoos do not make good guard dogs because they are not extremely territorial and because of their friendly nature.
Shihpoos do not do well living outdoors. They need to be indoor dogs.

, The Shihpoo is energetic and fun-loving, and loves playing the clown. He is good at cheering people up and helping anyone not feel lonely. He is good with families, but he is also great for singles because he is perfectly happy with one attentive owner.Shihpoos are also great for seniors.
Shihpoos are great with children, as long as children are supervised and taught to handle the dog gently. Shihpoos don’t like having their hair pulled, so make sure your children know not to do this., Shihpoos don't need long walks to tire them out because they don't need long walks.They are extremely energetic though. Playing with them in the house or apartment, or giving them toys, should be enough. They will run around your house, play with stuffed animals, and chase balls.


Short, brisk walks twice a day is great exercise for a Shihpoo. They also like running around yards or parks.
If your aim is to have a dog to get out and about to meet people, or to exercise with, a Shihpoo may not be the dog for you.

, The Shihpoo is sometimes promoted as a hypoallergenic dog, meaning people say he is a breed that people with dog allergies can tolerate. However, this is not true. The Shihpoo is just as likely to trigger allergies as other breeds.If your main consideration for getting a Shihpoo is this, be aware you are likely to have allergy problems.

, The Shihpoo can inherit characteristics from either parent. While the poodle is considered highly intelligent and easy to train, the Shih Tzu has a laissez faire attitude. The Shih Tzu has a reputation for being slow to house break, so this might mean your Shihpoo can have difficulties training.This doesn't mean if your Shihpoo inherits the Shih Tzu's character he is impossible to train, but the owner has to be prepared to be patient and give out clear consistent messages when you are house training him.
You must be prepared for accidents indoors and know that punishing the dog is inappropriate.

Discuss it with your insurance company.,
Check businesses when traveling.,
Look at local businesses.",How to Check Dog Breed Bans2," Your homeowner's insurance or rental insurance likely has certain breeds on a banned list, meaning they won't provide coverage if you have one of these dogs. Others may increase your premiums. Either way, it's important to talk with your insurance company before getting a new dog that may be considered dangerous.Pit bulls, doberman pinschers, rottweilers, wolf-hybrids, Siberian huskies, Akitas, great Danes, chows, German shepherds, Alaskan malamutes, and presa canarios are most commonly considered ""problem"" breeds.

, When traveling with your pet, you may find that certain airlines and certain hotels will ban specific breeds. It's always best to check with the specific company you're traveling with before trying to bring your dog. You don't want to be stuck somewhere with no place to spend the night because your dog can't come in.You also need to check local laws when bringing your pet somewhere. If the city you're traveling in has a ban on your dog, it's obviously not a good idea to bring it with you. Look on the city's website, as well as the state's website, to see if your dog is welcome in that area., Some businesses are dog-friendly. However, even among dog-friendly businesses, many do not allow certain dogs. Always call and check with the business before turning up with your dog, so you don't waste a trip.


Note there are exceptions for service dogs. Under the American with Disabilities Act (ADA), service dogs are excluded from breed bans. However, if it's determined that a specific dog poses a direct threat to others, it can be included in the ban."
"
Check with each new landlord.,
Be prepared for landlords that need convincing.,
Try not to get angry.",How to Check Dog Breed Bans3," In most areas, landlords can ban any pets they want. You don't have a right to own a certain type of dog on another person's property. Therefore, it's always best to ask about your dog before signing a rental agreement. The landlord may ban certain breeds, and your dog may not be allowed to live there.Most landlords require you to sign a pet agreement. If you don't sign one, you may have more leeway under the law to keep a breed your landlord bans.
Keep in mind that some landlords may ban certain breeds out of necessity, due to the insurance they carry.

, Have evidence ahead of time that your dog isn't trouble or a nuisance. You can have a letter from your vet, for instance, stating that your dog is not violent or destructive. You could also have letters from previous landlords or neighbors who can attest to the fact that your dog is generally good. Also, make sure to lay out how you've trained your dog, as well as what you do when you're working (such as crate the dog).Also, lay out any way you plan to protect the place you're renting from your dog.

, Usually, landlords have rules in place because they've been burned in the past. Besides, getting angry won't help. You may be able to persuade a reluctant landlord if you are calm and reasonable, but if you start yelling, you shut down any chances you may have of renting there with your dog."

Choose your breeder carefully.,
Visit the breeder.,
Make sure your puppy is socialized properly.,
Ask what tests they give their puppies.",How to Care for Shihpoos2," Do your research thoroughly in order to find a responsible breeder. Speak to owners of Shihpoos and find out who their dog's breeder was. If you don't know any owners, speak to your vet who may be able to put you in touch with someone who is prepared to help you.Check out the breeder's reputation online.

, Before you buy your dog, call the breeder and ask to visit. Pay attention to the breeder's attitude. They should ask you as many questions as you ask them. A responsible breeder will want to know their puppy is going to a good home., Socialization is crucial to the future character of your Shihpoo. If he is raised in an isolated environment, such as an outdoor kennel, or taken from his mother too early, like in a puppy farm, then he is likely to grow into a dog that has behavioral issues.The breeder should make efforts for as many different people as possible to meet the puppies from around three to four weeks of age, so the young dogs are used to people of different heights, appearances, and tones of voice.
Never buy a puppy from a puppy mill. A puppy mill breeder makes an excuse as to why the mother dog is not available to view. This trade is unethical and immoral, and should not be encouraged by buying these puppies and creating a demand.

, Ask the breeder what tests they voluntarily give their dogs. These tests help identify certain breed specific diseases. Be aware that good breeding stock does not guarantee a healthy puppy, but it goes a long way to reducing the risk of a sickly dog.The genuine breeder will be able to produce certification to backup their claims.
The tests currently available for breeding dogs include tests for renal dysplasia and juvenile renal dysplasia; hip dysplasia; portosystemic shunt; and progressive retinal atrophy."
"
Be aware of breed specific diseases.,
Vaccinate your puppy.,
Deworm your puppy.,
Neuter or spay your dog.",How to Care for Shihpoos3," Because the Shihpoo is a cross between a poodle and a Shih Tzu, know they may have problems of both breeds. The problems associated with the Shih Tzu include patellar luxation, juvenile renal dysplasia, dry eye, hip dysplasia, progressive retinal atrophy, umbilical hernia, allergies, and portosystemic shunts.The genetic diseases linked to poodles include dilated cardiomyopathy, sebaceous adenitis, retinal atrophy, anal sac disease, underactive thyroid glands, Cushing's disease, Addison's disease, and luxating patellas.

, Your puppy will need to be vaccinated against various canine infectious diseases. Exactly which diseases depends on which infections are prevalent in your area, and so your veterinary surgeon is best placed to advise on the best protocol for each individual. The breeder should have already taken your puppy to the vet and started his vaccinations. Find out when he started so you can give this information to the vet so they can schedule follow-up vaccinations.


The diseases against which vaccination may be given include distemper, parvovirus, canine adenovirus, leptospirosis, infectious canine hepatitis, parainfluenza virus, and Lyme disease.
A vaccination against rabies is obligatory in many states and you will be breaking the law not to comply. The first dose is given after 12 weeks of age.

, Your Shihpoo will need deworming. These medications come in a wide variety of forms, including tablets, oral liquids or granules, and spot products. Talk to your vet about which medication is right for you.Flea and tick prevention is also pivotal. Talk to your vet about which medicine is appropriate for your dog.
You should check your dog every day for ticks and remove them with a tick hook.

, Desexing your puppy should be discussed with your veterinarian. It is usual to operate on females from four to six months of age, and males around six to 10 months of age.This age varies depending on the individual vet clinic.
Neutering and spaying prevents unscheduled breeding. Spaying protects the female dog against mammary cancer, if surgery if performed before the second heat.

Feed your dog quality food.,
Groom your Shihpoo.,
Brush your dog’s teeth.,
Use reward-based training.",How to Care for Shihpoos4," Give your Shihpoo a good quality food. Look at the label on the bag and make sure a named meat is the first and second ingredient on the bag. It can include meat byproducts or grains, but it should be farther down the list. The Shihpoo should be fed dry kibble because the breed has a high risk of dental problems.Use the amount recommended on the pack as a starting point. Shihpoos love to eat and can over eat easily, so you have to monitor his food intake.Regularly weigh your dog to make sure he is not gaining too much weight. Your dog should have a waist line when viewed from above or the side, and you should be able to feel his ribs easily, but without the ribs standing out through the skin.
A Shihpoo can be fed once or twice daily, according to your personal preference.
Never exercise your dog immediately after eating. Wait for at least 90 minutes before exercise. There is a risk of the dog's stomach flipping over and becoming twisted, which is a life-threatening condition called bloat.

, Grooming your Shihpoo will depend on his coat type, which could be curly or long and smooth. Brushing your dog daily in order to keep the coat in good order and knot free. This also conditions your dog’s skin.Bathe your dog once a month because Shihpoos can have skin conditions.
Trim the genital area on your Shihpoo. The long hair can get urine and feces caught in it. You can also get a groomer to shave the lower area.If the Shihpoo grows long fur on their face, it can get in his eyes and cause irritation or act as a blindfold. Either keep their face trimmed short, or gather the long fur up in a topknot to keep it away from their eyes.Check your dog over after each walk. Look for grass awns that may be lodged in fur around the ears or paws.

, Take care of your dog’s teeth by getting into the habit of regular tooth brushing. Use a special dog toothbrush or a finger mitt. Wet the brush with water and gently rub it on the outer surfaces of the teeth. Once the dog is happy with this, you can introduce a blob of dog toothpaste onto the brush. You can do this once a week.These pastes are tasty to dogs, don't need rinsing and are free from substances harmful to dogs if swallowed, such as fluoride.
Never give a dog human toothpaste.

, Use reward-based training with your Shihpoo. Find what he is prepared to work for, such as his favorite treat, toy, or even affection.If his attention span is short, opt for shorter but more frequent training sessions, such as five minutes, four times a day. These are going to be more successful than less frequent shorter ones.
If you are struggling to housebreak your Shihpoo, know that you must not punish him for having accidents in the house. Instead, give him plenty of opportunity to go outside and stay with him so that you are there spot to reward him when he does go in the right place.

Choose a high-quality food that is meant for small breeds.,
Consult with a pet nutrition expert if plan to make your dog’s food.,
Determine how much to feed your dog.,
Maintain a regular feeding schedule.,
Consider your dog’s age.,
Provide lots of clean, fresh water.,
Give your puggle some healthy treats.,
Avoid giving your dog toxic human foods.",How to Care for Puggles1," Your puggle will need to have a high-quality food to keep him in good health and you will also need to choose a food that is appropriate for small breed dogs. To determine if a food is of high quality, check the ingredients. If meat (not a meat by-product) is listed as the first two ingredients, then the dog food is most likely of high quality. If not, then keep looking.


You can also find dog foods that are formulated just for small dog breeds.;
, Making your dog’s food requires careful planning to ensure that you meet all of your dog’s nutritional needs. Dogs require a specific balance of vitamins and nutrients, which is not easy to achieve.Talk to your puggle’s veterinarian first if you are considering preparing homemade food for your dog.

, Your puggle’s daily food requirement will depend on his weight and activity level. Your dog food package should provide a suggested feeding range, but you will need to tailor this amount to your dog’s activity needs.


For example, if the dog food package recommend ½ to one cup of food per day and your dog is very active, then you will need to give him the full cup of food each day. If he is more sedentary, then he may only require ½ cup per day.
Ask your veterinarian for a recommendation if you are still not sure how much you should be feeding your puggle., Some people like to free-feed their pets, which is when you leave out a large amount of dry food and allow your pet to eat as much as he wants. This can cause your puggle to become overweight or even obese, so it is best to stick to measured portions and a regular feeding schedule instead.To determine how much to feed your puggle at each meal, you will need to divide his total daily food intake into multiple portions. For example, if your puggle is supposed to have one cup of food per day, then you might give him ½ cup in the morning and another ½ cup in the evening.

, If your puggle tolerates it, you can give her all of her daily food in one meal per day, but some dogs do better if fed two meals per day. If your puggle is still a puppy, then she may require more than two feeding sessions per day. If your puppy is:


eight to 12 weeks, then feed four meals per day
three to six months, then feed three meals per day
six months to one year old, then feed two meals per day, Puggles need to have access to plenty of fresh, clean water at all times. Make sure that you wash and refill your puggle’s water dish at least once per day. Keep his water dish somewhere that is easy for him to access.


Stainless steel or ceramic water dishes are best for dogs because your dog will not be able to chew on it. Stainless steel and ceramic water dishes also tend to be cleaner than plastic.

, Your puggle will appreciate the occasional treat, but it is important not to give your dog too many treats or he may start to gain weight. Instead of higher calorie treats, try offering:


steamed broccoli
baby carrots
cooked sweet potato slices
cooked green beans
blueberries
watermelon chunks
banana slices, There are also some foods that can make your puggle very sick or even kill him. Be careful to avoid giving these foods to your dog. These foods include:alcohol
avocados
chocolate
caffeine
grapes and raisins

Provide lots of clean, fresh water.,
Give your Miniature Schnauzer some healthy treats.,
Steer clear of toxic human foods.",How to Care for Miniature Schnauzers1," Your Miniature Schnauzer will need a high-quality food meant for small breed dogs to help him thrive. High-quality foods often list meat (not meat by-products) as the first two ingredients on the label, so read the ingredients before you buy.


Miniature Schnauzers do well with a dry food that has about a 10 to 15% fat content, so you should also check the label’s nutritional information to see if the food is within this range.;
, Feeding your miniature Schnauzer two meals per day on a regular schedule will help to encourage good eating habits and it may also help with potty training.You can use the recommended feeding amount listed on your Miniature Schnauzer’s dog food packaging to help you determine how much to feed him at each meal. Take this amount and divide it in half to determine how much food to offer your Miniature Schnauzer at each meal.
Try feeding your Miniature Schnauzer one meal in the morning and one in the evening.
If you have a puppy, then you will need to feed him three or even four times per day. Check with your veterinarian or a breed expert to be sure.

, Your miniature Schnauzer must always have access to plenty of clean, fresh water.Make sure that you keep a bowl of water somewhere that is easy for him to access. For example, you might place his water dish in your kitchen or a few feet away from his bed.


Change his water daily and check it often. Make sure that the water is always fresh and clean.
Clean your Miniature Schnauzer’s water dish once per day to keep it hygienic. Try using a stainless steel bowl since they are durable and less likely to harbor bacteria.

, All dogs are prone to obesity as well as humans, so it is important to limit your Miniature Schnauzer’s treat foods. Instead of giving your pet table scraps that might make him sick, offer a small portion of something healthy as an occasional treat. Some good examples include:

Once the tangles are removed, brush your Papillon’s coat with a bristle brush, and finish by combing its hair.Before brushing the hair, spritz it with water or a leave-in conditioner. Brushing the hair while it is dry can damage it.Be sure to regularly trim the hair around your dog’s feet. Any hair growing out past the pads should be trimmed back. Use either scissors or an electric trimmer to trim the hair.;
, The plaque and tartar build-up on a Papillon’s teeth can cause infections, rotted teeth, and disease. It is recommended that you brush your dog’s teeth every day. Use canine toothpaste, and either a small toothbrush designed specifically for small breeds, or a finger toothbrush.


Lift your dog’s lip. Then, place the toothbrush or your finger at the margin where the teeth and gum meet at a 45-degree angle. Slowly move the toothbrush in an oval motion. Gently force the bristle ends into the space between the teeth, and the area around the base of the tooth.Chew toys and dog chews also help with tartar control. However, they should not replace regular brushing.

, Papillon’s nails grow pretty fast. It is time to trim its nails when you can hear the nails clacking on the floor as your Papillon walks, or once every 10 to 15 days. Since Papillon’s nails are so small, it is recommended that you use a grinder to trim its nails. Grinders are less stressful, as well.Take your dog’s paw and spread it gently. Remove any dirt and debris between the toes. Then, firmly, but gently, hold one toe. Take the nail grinder and lightly grind the tip of the nail. Papillon nails are small, so one quick “zip-zip” is all it takes to trim the nail.If you or your dog is extremely uncomfortable with nail cutting, you can always take your dog to the vet or a grooming service to have their nails clipped.

, Because Papillon’s have a lot of hair in and around their ears, check their ears once a week for debris and wax build. If your Papillon’s inner ears appear dirty, dampen a cotton ball or piece of gauze with mineral oil, hydrogen peroxide, or a liquid cleaner especially formulated for dogs. Then wipe its ears.Fold your Papillon’s ear back and wipe away any wax and debris. Be careful not to push or rub the debris farther into your dog’s ear. Instead, lift the debris out of your dog’s ear.
Try not to clean your dog’s ears too frequently, or deeply, as this can cause irritation or infection.

Look for excessive panting and trouble breathing.,
Notice signs of pain or discomfort.,
Pay attention to unwillingness to continue.,
Take medical conditions into consideration.,
Do not stop exercising your older dog.,
Continue your dog's favorite activities with alterations.,
Take the temperature and other conditions into consideration.,
Try new types of exercise.",How to Tell if Your Older Dog Is over Exerting Itself," If your dog is getting winded more easily than it used to then you may need to exercise it less. Problems breathing, coughing or hacking, or lots of panting can be a sign that your older dog is doing too much. Allow the dog to catch its breath and calm down. After the dog has recovered you may be able to continue the activity at a slower pace.


Look at your dog's tongue while it is panting. If the tongue is bright red, this means that the dog is overworked and needs time to rest.Some amount of heavy breathing is normal when exercising. However, if your dog is having a hard time catching its breath under very little exertion, then you should get it looked at by a veterinarian. This can be the sign of a health problem that needs to be treated.;
, If your dog is limping or moving awkwardly, it could mean that your dog is in pain and has overexerted itself.Many older dogs have joint and muscle issues that can be painful and impact their ability to exercise. If your dog is older then you should be on the lookout for signs of this type of problem.


Allow your dog to rest if it shows signs that it is in pain.
Schedule a veterinary appointment if the limping does not go away within a day., Don't force an elderly dog to continue an activity it is really refusing to do. If your dog doesn't want to walk any further or play a game with you anymore, then it may be too tired to continue. Let it rest where it is and try to restart the walk or the activity once it has had some time to recover.This is a case of better safe than sorry. In some cases, your older dog may just be stubborn and exertion has nothing to do with its refusal to continue. However, it's better to keep your dog's body safe than to risk overexerting it.

, If you know that your dog has a medical condition that could impact its ability to do activities, then you need to keep that in mind and adjust your activities. Alter your dog's routine to adjust to its new reality and don't assume that your dog can do everything it has always done.


For example, if your dog has always gone on long hikes with you but it is having some joint issues, then you need to adjust your expectations. Take it on short, less strenuous hikes than you used to.
Another example is dealing with stairs. If your dog has a health problem that could impact its ability to climb stairs, for instance if it has a herniated disc in its back, then you may need to adjust its routine to avoid stair climbing. This could mean taking a new route on your daily walk, placing ramps in your home, or simply keeping your dog off of stairs in general.

, Older dogs need exercise just as much as younger dogs do. However, they just need different types and amounts of exercise. In fact, for an older dog to continue to stay healthy and happy it needs regular exercise to keep its joints, muscles, and bones strong.The key is to find a happy medium between too much exercise and too little exercise. This will differ for all dogs but many older dogs benefit from a simple daily walk.If your dog is losing stamina, your daily walk may even need to transform into several shorter daily walks. Three short walks will be easier on a dog with mobility issues than one long walk.

, Just because your dog is older that does not mean it has to stop doing all the things it loves in order to avoid overexerting it. It does, however, mean that the dog's activities should be altered to take its current health into consideration.For example, keep walking your dog but make the activities shorter if your dog is getting winded. Keep taking your dog to play on the beach but just do it for a shorter time period. Keep your dog active and happy but just alter its activities a bit.

, When a dog gets older it will have less ability to cope with extreme conditions, such as hot or cold temperatures. If the weather is bad or extreme, you may want to find a way to exercise your older dog inside or otherwise protect it from the cold.For instance, if the weather is cold out put a sweater or coat on your dog and limit the amount of time it spends outside. If it refuses to wear it, then exercise the dog inside. If the weather is hot, go outside for very short periods, limit your dog's exertion, and make sure it has access to lots of water.
When exercising a dog outside you also need to take ice and snow into consideration. A dog with old joints can seriously injure itself with one slip on the ice.

, There are some types of exercise that are great for older dogs. For instance, swimming can be a great activity for older dogs because the buoyancy of the water allows the dog to move without a lot of pressure on its joints.Also, new types of activities inside your home, such as more tug-o-war or training exercises, can keep the dog active while protecting it from injury.


Be careful, however, about your dog's safety while doing a new activity. In the case of swimming, put a doggy life vest on the dog so that it can easily stay afloat even when tired.

Use positive reinforcement.,
Teach your dog basic commands.,
Set aside training time daily.,
Try obedience classes.",How to Teach Your Older Dog Basic Commands1," Your older dog will be more motivated to continue learning new commands throughout its life, if you use a positive rewards-based method. Training with verbal or physical punishment can scare your dog and make training sessions less fun. You can teach a variety of basic commands, such as “sit”, “down”, “stay”, and “come” to an older dog by using positive reinforcement.For example, teach your dog to “sit” by holding a treat in your hand in front of the dog. Then raise your arm up, causing your dog’s head to rise and bottom to lower to the ground. Say “sit” and then give the dog the treat.
You can also gently push your dog's bottom to the floor if they need extra guidance.
Repeat this exercise daily until your dog has mastered the command.;
, The four most important commands to teach your dog are ""sit"", ""down"", ""stay"", and ""come."" Always use a treat as a lure to help the dog perform the command and then provide them with lots of praise afterwards. Here are a few tips for teaching these commands:


To teach “come”: Put your dog on a leash and crouch down to its level. Say “come” and then gently pull the leash. When the dog gets to you, reward it with praise and a treat. Repeat with a leash until they understand the command without the pull. Then practice from further distances without a leash.To teach “down”: Hold a treat in front of your dog’s nose. Then move your hand down to the ground so the dog follows, and then slide the treat across the floor so the dog extends into a laying down position. Once in the position, say “down” and give the dog the treat.
To teach “stay”: Put the dog in a sitting position. Then hold your hand out in front of you, like a stop sign and say “stay”. Then take a step back. If the dog stays seated praise it and give it a treat. Repeat this and continue to increase the distance.

, In order to teach an adult dog basic commands, you will need to set aside a few hours each day to work on training. Older dogs, unlike puppies, can concentrate and focus for longer, however, they do not learn as quickly. As a result, you will need to be patient and consistent with your training. Do not get angry or frustrated with your dog and always keep training sessions positive and fun.Only work on one or two commands during a training session.
Always conclude training on a positive note. For example, if they are struggling with the “stay” command end the session with a command they have already mastered, like “sit”.

, Formal obedience classes are not just for puppies and they are an excellent way to teach your dog basic commands, especially if you have never trained a dog before. They also provide your dog with an opportunity to socialize with other dogs and people in a controlled and safe environment. If your adult dog has never had any formal training, then you should start with a beginner level obedience class.Obedience classes will provide your adult dog with mental stimulation.
They provide an opportunity for you to bond with your dog. This can be especially important if you have adopted an adult dog.

Give your dog anti-anxiety medication.",How to Reduce Howling in Older Dogs1," Even if your dog's howling has you at your wit’s end, do not try to reduce the howling before seeing your vet. Your vet can determine whether the howling’s cause is behavioral or medical. They will perform a physical exam and run various diagnostic tests (blood work, urinalysis, x-rays) to rule out medical causes, such as arthritis or kidney disease.


During the appointment, give your vet a history of the howling, including when it started, when it usually occurs (during the night, when you leave the house), and if it’s gotten more frequent.
If your dog does not have medical problems, then a behavioral issue is the likely cause of the howling.;
, Separation anxiety is common in older dogs.If your vet diagnosed your dog with separation anxiety, you can relieve this anxiety at home in several ways, such as exercising. The physical demands of daily exercise will help your dog feel less anxious and reduce anxiety-induced howling. Examples of exercises include:


Twice-daily walksRuns, if your dog is physically able to run

, The fear of being alone can make a dog feel anxious and start howling. If your older dog has anxiety-induced howling, it could be calling out for you, even when you’re not home. Regular, daily playtime will give your dog the attention it needs from you to feel more relaxed and howl less. Try these playtime ideas:



Fetch, if your dog can easily run and jump
Hide and seek
Teaching new commands

, Separation anxiety is often associated with a dog owner leaving the house. If your older dog howls when you leave, reduce its howling by teaching it that your departure is no big deal:Go through your normal departure routine (grabbing your keys, putting on your coat) without actually leaving the house. Practice this a few times a day.
Leave the house for short periods of time, maybe as short as 10 seconds, then come back in when your dog stops howling. Reward your dog with a treat after the howling stops. Gradually increase the amount of time that you leave the house.
Be patient. It may take weeks or months before your dog stops howling when you leave the house.

, For some older dogs, the separation anxiety is so severe that behavioral changes aren’t enough. If your dog’s anxiety-induced howling hasn’t lessened, take your dog to your vet. Your vet will prescribe an anti-anxiety medication.Realize that medication alone will not relieve your dog’s anxiety or reduce the howling. Continue with the behavioral strategies after you start your dog on the anti-anxiety medication."

Keep your dog inside.,
Observe your dog’s movements when inside.,
Watch your dog when it’s outside.",How to Protect an Easily Disoriented Older Dog1," A disoriented older dog can easily get confused about where it is. This could be dangerous if your dog is outside and can’t remember how to get back inside. Even if your dog gets disoriented when inside, the indoor environment is likely safer than the outdoor environment.;
, When your dog is indoors, watch where it goes. Pay attention to if your dog walks into a corner and can’t get out, or gets stuck behind a door. These actions could be distressing to your dog.


Protect your dog from this distress by gently guiding it out of corners or behind doors. Talk in a soothing voice while you’re doing this so your dog can feel safer and more relaxed.

, If you have a backyard, keep a close eye on your dog when you let it outside to go to the bathroom. When in the yard, your dog get easily disoriented, forget how to come back to the house, and possibly wander off (if there’s no fence). It may help to go out in the yard with your dog so you can guide it back to the house.


If your dog wanders off and heads toward the street, it could get hit by a car, which could cause serious injury or be fatal.

Put problem behaviours on cue.,
Use basic commands to stop problem behaviour.,
Ensure that all family members are engaged with training.",How to Teach Your Older Dog Basic Commands2," Many dogs will develop bad habits throughout their life, such as excessive barking or jumping up on people. These behaviours can often interrupt obedience training. A major part of training an older dog is actually correcting bad behaviours. One way to do this, is to put problem behaviours on cue. For example, teach your dog to bark and stop on command. Try this technique:Say the command “speak” then have a family member or friend ring the doorbell. This will likely cause your dog to bark.
To get your dog to stop barking, say the command “shush” and wave a treat in front of its nose. In order to sniff the treat, the dog will have to stop barking.
Once it has stopped barking praise the dog and give it the treat.
Repeat this training until they associate the commands “bark” and “shush” with treats.

, If your dog always jumps up on people when they enter the house or is aggressive at meal time, you will want to modify these behaviours. One way to do this is to stop the bad behaviour and replace it with a basic obedience command. For example, once your dog has learned to sit, you can tell them to sit when someone enters the house. They will not be able to jump up if they are sitting.


Alternatively, you could tell your dog to sit and stay while you get out their food. Then once you are ready say ""ok"" and let them eat.
These types of commands will help to solidify your position as the leader in the household.

, When changing behaviours in an older dog, consistency and patience are very important. To ensure that your dog gets the consistency they need, make sure that all members of the family are engaged in the training and using the same command words. For example, if you are saying “shush” to stop the dog from barking, but another family member says “quiet” this will confuse the dog and slow down the training.


Be patient. It will take a lot longer to change bad behaviours that have been accepted or reinforced for years.

Change commands if your dog has mobility issues.,
Modify training if your dog is deaf.,
Use additional voice commands for training a blind dog.,
Avoid training if your dog has a cognitive disorder.",How to Teach Your Older Dog Basic Commands3," You may find that your older dog is struggling to learn some of the basic commands, such as sit or lie down. This may be a result of mobility issues, such as hip dysplasia or arthritis. The dog is not following the command because it is too painful. If your dog has mobility issues, you may need to modify training to avoid painful positions. For example, work on the “stay” and “come” commands, instead of “sit”., Older dogs may also suffer from hearing loss, which makes vocal commands impossible to teach. Do not give up on training, instead, try using hand signals to teach your older dog basic commands.For example, teach your dog to sit using a hand signal. Simply place a treat in your hand, stretch your arm out in front of you (palm facing up) and then move your arm downwards to the side of your leg.
At first you may need to give the signal and physically adjust your dog into a sitting position.
Once sitting, give the dog a treat. Repeat this until the dog learns the signal command and no longer needs to be adjusted.
You can teach other hand signals either by following standard dog obedience commands or by following American Sign Language commands.

, In order to teach a blind dog basic obedience commands, you will need to rely more on vocal orders. Always work in a quiet and familiar space. Teach basic commands to a blind dog in the same manner that you would teach a dog with full vision. The only difference is that you may need to provide more vocal directions. For example, if you are teaching your blind dog to ""come"" they may get disoriented or lost trying to reach you. As a result, you should continue talking to them and providing encouragement. That way they can follow your voice in order to locate you., Other factors that may impact your older dog’s ability to learn, are cognitive disorders such as “doggy alzheimer's.” For example, your dog may start to display signs of aging, such as disorientation, clinginess, increased sleeping or restlessness, etc. Take your dog to the vet in order to determine the cause of the change in behaviour.Ask your vet what, if any, training can be accomplished with your dog.

Administer pain medication.,
Treat your dog’s dementia.,
Follow-up with your vet.",How to Reduce Howling in Older Dogs2," If your vet identified a medical problem as the cause of your dog’s howling, treating that problem will help reduce the howling. Older dogs can develop arthritis, which can be so painful that a dog will howl with distress.If your dog has arthritis, your vet will prescribe an anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain.After experiencing pain relief, your dog may not howl so much.
Administer the pain medication as prescribed so your dog gets the maximum benefit from the treatment.

, Howling, especially at night, is a common symptom of dementia in older dogs. Although dementia has no cure, medication can help reduce the symptoms. If your dog has dementia, your vet will prescribe a drug called Anipryl, which improves brain function in dogs.Anipryl probably won’t make your dog’s howling stop completely. However, it can help reduce the howling.

, Let your vet know if the medications are helping to reduce the howling. If your dog’s howling is still the same, your vet may need to adjust the drug dosage or prescribe a different type of medication.

"
"
Keep a predictable routine.,
Make your dog’s living area comfortable.,
Enrich your dog’s environment with toys.",How to Reduce Howling in Older Dogs3," Older dogs, especially those with dementia, do not always adjust well to change. A new routine can be disorienting and stressful, which could lead to howling. Keep your dog’s daily routine the same by performing activities (feeding, walking, playing) at the same time each day.Having a consistent routine will help your dog feel relaxed and confident with what will happen each day.

, A comfortable physical environment will also help your older dog feel at ease and less likely to howl. Give your dog its ‘creature comforts,’ such as favorite toys and comfortable bedding. If your dog has trouble getting around, place its food and water bowls near its bed so it doesn’t have to walk so far to eat and drink.

, Dogs love to play. You can help your dog feel more comfortable by giving it lots of toys. If your dog is comfortable and stays mentally busy, it may not howl so much. Give your dog a variety of toys to play with and rotate them regularly to prevent boredom:Give your dog a food puzzle toy, which will be a mental challenge for your dog and keep it busy for a long time.
Chew toys will also keep your dog busy and entertained.

Do not rearrange your furniture.,
Keep the same daily routine.,
Walk the same route each day.",How to Protect an Easily Disoriented Older Dog2," If your older dog has gotten used to your furniture in a certain way, changing the furniture arrangement could cause your dog to get even more disoriented. Your dog could start bumping into furniture and possibly injuring itself. To help protect your dog from injury due to its disorientation, keep your furniture in the same place., In older dogs, brain function starts to decrease due to a buildup of a protein called amyloid.With your dog’s brain not working so well, it could have a hard time adjusting to change. If your older dog gets easily disoriented, changes to its routine could be distressing.


As much as possible, make sure your dog eats, goes out for walks, and has playtime at about the same time each day.

, An easily disoriented dog will not have a good sense of direction. When you take your dog out for a walk, consider walking the same route each time. This way, your dog may not get so easily disoriented and distressed when outside.


Keep your dog on a leash during the walks so it doesn’t wander off when it gets disoriented.

Show your older dog gentle love.,
Return your dog’s affection.,
Put yourself at your dog’s level.,
Provide lots of praise—and treats.",How to Show Affection to an Older Dog1," Any attention you give a dog should be gentle and loving. But this is especially true with older dogs that require extra affection and may be easily stressed. Avoid squeezing or playing with your dog in a rough manner. Avoid raising your voice as much as possible. This not only shows your older dog affection, but helps it feel secure and stable.Combine enthusiastic praise and gentle petting anytime you are with your older dog.

Look for excrement consumption.,
Keep an eye out for depression.,
Listen for vocalizations that indicate anxiety.,
Monitor for destructive behavior.,
Look for escape.",How to Manage Separation Anxiety in Older Dogs1," If your doggie is house trained but suddenly starts voiding in the house, it might have to do with separation anxiety. Your dog might poop or pee right before or right after you walk out the door.It is important to note that issues with either urination or defecation may or may not be related to separation anxiety in older dogs. As dogs age, they often lose control of their bowels due to urinary incontinence or other medical conditions.
Urination or defecation in the house in a trained dog might also be due to a medication they recently started. Alternately, it might be because you (and your dog) just moved into a new house and the dog wants to mark its territory.
If your dog urinates or defecates when you are around as well as when you are not, it is probably not a case of separation anxiety.;
, Older dogs with separation anxiety often engage in coprophagia – consumption of their own feces. If you come home to a smeared, messy pile of excrement, it could be because your dog was consuming it. Check your dog’s mouth for a sticky brown smear that indicates it might have been eating its own feces., If you’re getting ready to leave, your dog might start to feel and act a bit down. If your dog heads away from the door as you leave – almost as if it is unwilling to watch you go – it could be because your exit makes it feel sad. Maybe your older dog was chewing a toy or playing happily with a ball until you ready yourself to head out, at which point it puts the toy aside and seems to no longer have any interest in it. Your dog might go to its “safe place” – a dog bed, a favored spot on the couch, or some other location in order to deal with the trauma of separation., If your dog starts barking excessively when you’re getting ready to leave, your dog might have separation anxiety. The barking, howling, or whining might occur at different times as you ready yourself to leave. For instance, your dog might being howling when you start getting dressed for work, or when you put your dog in its pen before leaving., If your dog starts gnawing the legs on kitchen chairs or tearing up pillows, it could be because it has anxiety.

Include information about your dog’s overall health, likes, and dislikes.Also, include information about your dog’s physical appearance, positive personality traits (warm, friendly, etc), spay/neuter status, and any limitations (not good with cats or children).Place your contact information on the flyer (name, phone number, email address). For your personal safety, do not include your home address on the flyer.
Don’t forget to proofread your flyer. Spelling or grammatical mistakes could hurt your chances of re homing your older dog.

, The more you can get the word out about your older dog needing a new home, the better. Place copies of the flyer on bulletin boards in churches, grocery stores, and community centers.You can also put flyers in libraries and coffee shops.Veterinary offices and pet supply stores are other great locations for flyers., In addition to posting flyers throughout your area, place ads about your dog on the internet and in your local newspaper. Many newspapers have a specific classified area for pet adoptions.Also, pet rescue groups may allow you to post your ad on their website for free or for a small donation.If you place an ad in the newspaper, consider placing it in Sunday’s paper, when more people are likely to read the newspaper.If you advertise online, use caution when placing your ad on sites like Craig’s list.People looking to adopt a dog through Craig’s list may not have your dog’s best interests at heart.

, Word-of-mouth advertising can also work well for re homing your older dog. Talk with your friends, family, and coworkers to get the word about your older dog needing a new home.If you take your dog to a dog park, talk with other dog owners while you are at the park.When you talk with people, make sure they know how to contact you in case they are interested, or they know someone who is interested, in adopting your older dog.

, You’ve had your dog for a long time and have a developed a special bond with it. You want to make sure it goes to someone who will love and care for it in the way it deserves. Therefore, be very selective when choosing your dog’s next owner. When people contact you, have a list of questions ready to ask them:What is your name, address, and phone number?
Do you rent or own a home? If you rent, does your landlord accept pets?
Do you have children? If so, how many and how old are they?
Have you ever owned a dog before?
Do you currently have pets? If so, how many and what types?

, If a prospective owner currently has pets, consider talking to their vets. Their vets can tell you how the owner cares for their current pets, which would indicate how well they would care for your older dog.Caring for an older dog can be a big responsibility. You want to be sure your dog’s next owner understands what it takes to care for a dog, especially one that is up in age.

, Visit the homes of the prospective owners who impressed you over the phone. Home visits will allow you to see what type of environment your dog could be living in, and observe how your dog reacts to the prospective owner and their house.These visits can also be a time for you to ask more questions.


Schedule multiple home visits. During the first visit, your dog may be nervous and stay close to you. During the next few visits, your dog will likely relax a bit and interact more with the prospective owner.As you talk with owner, pay close attention to your dog. If your dog isn’t warming up to the home or the owner after a few visits, then that living situation may not be right for it.

, Take time to decide which prospective owner will be best for your dog. If you or your dog felt uncomfortable with someone, do not feel bad about no longer considering them.Make the decision based on what will be best for your older dog.


Contact the owner you selected and begin moving forward with the adoption process.

, When you’ve selected an owner, do not just hand your dog over to that owner. Have them sign a contract to formalize the adoption.Fortunately, you don’t have to come up a contract from scratch. The website http://www.aforeverhome.org/forms/sample-adoption-contract/ has a sample contract you can use to draft your own contract.


An adoption contract, like other contracts, is legally binding.Make sure both you and the new owner understand and agree to all terms in the contract before signing it.
Because it may be at least several weeks before you can successfully re home your dog, develop the contract as you search for and screen prospective owners.

, Re homing an older dog isn’t easy. Because most people looking for dogs want puppies or young dogs, it will probably take you longer to find a new home for your older dog.It may take a month for longer before you find someone who wants an older dog.

, Do not advertise your dog as ‘free to a good home.’ This can attract many people who will not have your dog’s best interests at heart. Instead, set an adoption fee ($75 to $100) to help cover advertising and veterinary costs.The people willing to pay the fee will likely be willing to take on the cost of dog ownership.

, After your older dog has been re homed, keep an open line of contact with the new owner in case they have questions about caring for your dog.However, resist the temptation to visit your dog often. Your dog will need to adjust to its new owner and will not be able to do so if you visit frequently.

Make sure your dog maintains a healthy weight.,
Apply a warm compress on problem areas.,
Have your dog do non-weight bearing exercises.,
Support your dog in a sling.",How to Manage Arthritis in Senior Dogs1," You do not want your dog to be overweight and have arthritis, as extra pounds can put more stress on their joints. Make sure your dog is at a healthy weight for their age and breed. Your vet can tell you if your dog is overweight and help you monitor your pet’s weight so they are healthy.If your dog is overweight, your vet may suggest an eating plan where your dog is given a limited amount of healthy food. You may try giving your dog healthy treats to help them stay at a reasonable weight, especially if your dog is older.;
, You should try to keep your pet warm, as the cold can irritate their arthritis. If your pet has any problem areas that tend to swell up due to arthritis, you can try putting warm compresses on the area. You can also allow your pet to sleep with a hot water bottle so they are comfortable at night.Another way to keep problem areas warm is to put your dog in a pet sweater. Make sure the sweater goes over your pet’s torso and limbs so they can stay warm.

, Being physically active is important for senior dogs, as it helps them maintain a healthy weight and healthy joints. If your dog has mild, early arthritis, try having them do non-weight bearing exercises like swimming. The water will help to support their limbs as they swim and splash around.You can also try getting your dog to go on at least one leash walk a day. These exercises are a little more weight bearing so you may want to consult with your vet before doing them with your pup to ensure they will not irritate their arthritis.

, If the dog is struggling to walk or squat, you can assist them by making a sling. Slip a long wide piece of canvas, belt, or towel under your dog’s chest, and hold each end. Pull on the ends when your dog stands up to help them maintain their balance.This will take some weight off of the dog's back end so that they can walk more easily. You can also use the sling to help your dog climb the stairs and enter or exit the car.If you need a fast and easy sling, you can use a bath towel. Simply slide it under your dog’s chest and make sure the towel is long enough to support your dog when they move.

Use counterconditioning.,
Try desensitization.,
Tire your dog out.,
Take your dog to a safe space.,
Don’t make your comings and goings a big deal.",How to Manage Separation Anxiety in Older Dogs2," Counterconditioning is a process whereby your older dog’s fearful or anxious reaction to separation changes to a happy, pleasant, or otherwise positive reaction. You can do this by ensuring your dog has a positive experience when you leave the house.For instance, you could give your dog a KONG toy when you leave the house. KONG toys are rubber playthings filled with bits of kibble or other doggie snacks. As your dog shakes and plays with the toy, small bits of the snack will come out so your dog can eat them.
If your dog’s separation anxiety is only triggered when you or another family member leaves the house, whichever of you remains at home could soothe the dog by administering a doggie treat, petting and patting the dog gently, and offering soothing words of affection like, “It’s okay,” or “Don’t cry, doggie.”
Counterconditioning works best with dogs who have mild separation anxiety.

, Desensitization is a separation anxiety solution that requires confusing your dog’s mental “anxiety monitor” by separating from your dog with progressively greater duration and frequency over a long period. Your desensitization program should always begin by addressing the most basic first-stage symptoms of anxiety separation, then tackling more intense symptoms.For example, start by confronting your dog’s pre-departure anxiety. Maybe your dog pants and paces as you put on your coat or jacket. You can desensitize your dog to this behavior by putting on your coat and then – instead of exiting the house – sitting down to read a book.
Once your dog has become desensitized to pre-departure rituals and behaviors, desensitize your dog to exiting the house. Walk out of the house, then walk back in after 30 seconds or so. Continue doing this several times each day for a few days.
Every few days, increase the amount of time you spend outside your house by 60 seconds.
Enact departure rituals and head out the door several times each day for several weeks in order to fully desensitize your dog. How long it takes to fully desensitize your dog depends on its ability to learn that your departure behavior and cues should not inspire anxiety.
Desensitization is best for dogs with moderate or severe separation anxiety.

, If you know you’re headed out soon, take your older dog for a walk around the block or at the park. Adopt a moderate speed. When your dog starts to lag behind or pant more than it usually does, you’ll know it’s tuckered out. Take your dog home for a much-needed nap (or at least a period of prolonged relaxation). While your dog is sleeping, you can make your exit.Instead of going to the trouble of wearing your dog out before leaving the house, you could also just time your exit to coincide with your dog’s regular naptime, if it has one.

, Think about your dog’s favorite space in the house – perhaps a special room, a spot at the foot of the bed, or one of the arms of the sofa. Many dogs also associate their crate with security and feelings of relaxation. Inside its crate or in another safe space, therefore, your dog is less likely to feel the pain of separation anxiety. Place your older dog in its favorite safe spot and say, “Good-bye for now, good dog. I will return soon.”, Dogs are excellent at sensing emotions. Sometimes your older dog’s separation anxiety is a result of it detecting anxiety in you. If you are noticeably nervous and worried when you head out the door, your dog might pick up on this and, over time, turn it into a habit. On the other hand, if you’re cool, calm, and collected when you head out, your dog will understand that your exit is no cause for alarm, and you will return home in due time. Avoid petting your dog or talking a lot to it when entering and exiting.

Try an over-the-counter relaxation product.,
Try anti-anxiety apparel.,
Give your dog something with your scent.",How to Manage Separation Anxiety in Older Dogs3," There are a variety of commercially available medications and dog snacks that can keep your dog calm. Look for natural snacks or supplements that contain relaxing ingredients like lavender, lemon balm extract, ginger, chamomile, and other antioxidants. Give your dog one of these treats, capsules, or supplements before you head out.You might also look for tablets containing L-theanine (a stress-reducing amino acid) and/or tryptophan (an amino acid that encourages relaxation).
Follow manufacturer directions when using supplements and medications.

, There are several wearable products that can help your doggie stay calm. One is the Thundershirt. Thundershirts are designed to help calm dogs during a thunderstorm. The other product that might help calm your anxious dog is the calming collar.The shirt slips on over the dog’s back and straps around its chest and stomach. While the dog is wearing the Thundershirt, it feels safe and secure, as if it’s getting a gentle hug.
The Thundershirt is available at your local pet store and machine washable.
Like a regular dog collar, the calming collar slips around the dog’s neck and stays secure with a sliding strap. But the calming collar releases pleasing scent pheromones for up to one month. These scent pheromones will keep your dog at peace even when you leave.
The calming collar is perfect for dogs who don’t want to take pills or wear a Thundershirt.

, Give your dog some unwashed clothes you wore recently that still have your scent. You could provide just one shirt, or a small pile of shirts, socks, and pants to help your dog feel close to you even when you’re far away.You might be surprised at what your dog likes. Try to include some stinky socks or sweaty gym shorts for your dog to sniff.
If your old dog’s sense of smell has been dulled, try another object or technique to deal with its separation anxiety.

Supervise the dog when they first move indoors.,
House train your dog.,
Take your dog to the vet.,
Take the dog to obedience classes.,
Keep your dog in a designated area until they adjust.,
Keep your dog groomed.",How to Make an Outdoor Dog an Indoor Dog As It Ages2," For the first few weeks your dog is inside, you should closely monitor them. You may want to keep them on a leash or not leave them unsupervised for long periods of time. This can help you train them to not mess in the house, chew on things, or engage in other negative behaviors.After about three weeks, you can stop watching your dog so closely if they are not doing any bad behavior.

, One of the things you’ll have to do when you bring your outdoor dog indoors is house train them. They are used to going to the bathroom whenever and wherever they want, so they have to learn to only go outside.Take your dog outside to use the bathroom in the morning, before bed, after meals, and any other time you think they may need to go. It may help to take your dog out more often initially, every two to three hours, to help your dog adjust.
Reward your dog’s good behavior with treats and positive praise. Pick a treat that your dog greatly enjoys, and be sure to reward them as soon as they have relieved themselves. Don't wait until your inside, or your dog may not understand the reward.

, If your dog is showing any odd behavior, you should take them to the vet for a check up. Things like aggression, barking, excessive chewing, changes in eating or drinking habits, or inability to be house trained may point to a medical problem. It’s a good idea to get your dog a checkup just in case.If you haven’t taken your dog to the vet in awhile, you may want to get them a checkup when you decide to bring them indoors to ensure they remain healthy.
Make sure that your dog is up to date on flea and tick prevention at this time, too, to avoid bringing unwanted bugs into the home.

, If you are afraid your dog won’t behave well in the house, or if you can’t seem to get them trained, then you may want to consider getting help. You can enroll your dog in obedience classes or hire a professional dog trainer.Professional training can help your dog become house trained, learn basic commands, and stop barking or chewing.
Make sure you only hire trainers who use humane training techniques. Your dog should not be harmed or treated badly while learning. Make sure the training classes use positive reinforcement and praise.

, Some dogs will immediately adjust to being inside. Others may take more time. If this is the case, consider keeping your dog in a dog-friendly room or a crate when you are not home. You may also use baby gates to keep the dog in certain rooms.This helps the dog stay out of trouble when you are not home. For example, your dog won’t have an opportunity to mess in the floor or chew up furniture if you place them a specific room.
Leave the dog toys and fresh water when you are gone. You may consider picking up food, though, if your dog is not used to free-feeding or has a tendency to overeat.

, When you bring your dog indoors, you want to make sure they stay clean and groomed. Give your dog regular baths. Comb and trim their hair if they are a long haired breed. Keep their nails clipped. If you don’t want to do all of this yourself, you can take them to the dog groomers.If your dog has fleas or ticks, you can talk to the vet about medication to help get rid of them.

Create a warm, padded sleeping space for your dog.,
Keep food and water bowls at a comfortable height.,
Install ramps and barriers in your home.",How to Manage Arthritis in Senior Dogs2," To ensure your dog stays warm, you should set up a padded sleeping space for the in an area that is free of drafts or cold air. You may get a firm, orthopedic bed for them that is dome shaped to help distribute their weight evenly and put less pressure on their joints. Set up their bed in a warm place in your home that is not near a window or a drafty area so they stay warm. Cold can irritate their arthritis.You may also make sure there are a lot of soft, padded spots for your dog to lounge and rest on in your home. Couches, ottomans, and soft carpet are all great for dogs with arthritis, as they help to support and cushion their joints.

, You do not want your pup to have to strain themselves to reach their food and water. Place their food and water bowls at a spot they can reach, such as on the ground by the door or on the lowest step of a set of stairs.If you live in a multi-level home, make sure there is a water bowl for your pet on every floor. This will reduce the amount of time they have to spend going up and down the stairs to get a drink.
You should also make sure their food and water dishes are on a non-slip surface, such as a rubber mat. This will ensure your dog is not at risk of slipping or tripping when they eat.

, You should do your best to ensure your dog can move around easily in your home, even with their arthritis. Consider installing ramps in your home so your dog can go up stairs or access other areas of your home with ease. Make your own ramps from plywood covered in carpeting or buy ramps at your local pet store.Make sure the ramps are not too steep and that both ends are secure so your pet is not at risk of injury.
You can also set up barriers in your home to prevent your dog from using the stairs. Sometimes, dogs do not know they are putting too much stress on their joints. Putting up barriers makes it clear they need to stay on one floor of the home and avoid climbing up and down stairwells to avoid irritating their arthritis.

Make sure your dog has a safe space.,
Prepare your dog before a new family member enters the home.,
Isolate your dog if the environment becomes stressful.",How to Manage Aggression in Older Dogs2," Your older dog should feel safe and in control in their environment. As a pet owner, you should make sure your dog has a space that feels secure in your home. This could be their dog bed in the corner of the living room or their play area in a spare room. Your dog should have a safe space that they can retreat to if they start to feel aggressive or stressed out.If your dog does not have a safe space in your home, or you have moved to a new home with your pet, you should set up this space for them. Place their bed in a spot in the living room so they feel in control of the space. Or keep their toys in a container in the same spot so they can reach them easily and claim the area as theirs.

, Many older dogs can become aggressive due to a change in their environment, such as a new family member or a new pet in their space. They may struggle with the change and become aggressive to you or to the new family member. You can minimize your dog’s stress by preparing them before the new family member arrives.One way to help your dog adapt to a new family member is to introduce them to your pet slowly and over time. You may have your dog smell the clothing of the new family member so they get used to the smell and the presence of someone new. Or you may set up play dates between your dog and a new puppy so they can interact before the puppy is in the space permanently.

, Another calming technique is to use positive reinforcement with your dog, where you reward their good behavior and focus on being positive around them. When your older dog follows a command and avoids getting aggressive, make sure you reward them with a treat and verbal praise, such as “Good going!” or “Very good!”If the dog starts to get agitated or aggressive, you may try using a positive tone and say “Calm!” Then, give them a treat if they remain calm. You can use your mood to influence your dog’s mood so they are not tense or upset in stressful situations.

, Working with a professional trainer or a professional behavioral expert can help you learn other calming techniques. Many trainers can create custom programs for your dog to treat their aggressive. Look for a qualified animal behavior expert in your area and confirm they are certified.

Take your dog to the dog park.,
Walk your dog.,
Arrange playdates with other dogs.,
Introduce new dogs to your home slowly.",How to Maintain Social Skills in Older Dogs1," A great way to socialize your older dog is to take them to the dog park. At the dog park, they will have an opportunity to interact with other dogs and people. They also can run around and play for their exercise.If you are worried your dog won’t feel comfortable around the dogs at first, consider keeping them on a leash until they get used to the people and dogs.
You should only take them off-leash if they are not aggressive with other dogs or people. You should also only let them off the leash if they come to you when you call, if they don't run off randomly, and if they will stay with you when commanded. This ensures you can control your dog and avoid any incidents.;
, Another way you can socialize your dog is to take them for a walk. Walking around a park, neighborhood, or trails with people and other dogs helps socialize your dog.Exposing your dog to these areas puts them in contact with a lot of different people and dogs.


After your dog gets used to just being around people, try introducing him to people. Notice the people who pass you. If someone smiles and comments on your dog, ask them, ""Would you like to meet him? He's learning how to interact with people.""
Avoid people who look aggressive or who are walking aggressive dogs.

, Dogs are social animals that need to be around other people and dogs. One way to help with this is to let your dog play with other dogs. You can arrange a playdate for your dog and the dog of a friend, family member, colleague, or neighbor. This helps your dog be around other dogs and people.Start with dogs that your dog knows. This may be a neighbor's dog or a family members dog. You may also ask for a playdate with a dog your dog knows from the dog park. You may say, ""My dog is learning social skills and really gets along with your dog. Could we arrange a playdate for our dogs?""
If you are arranging a playdate with a neighborhood or family dog, ask for the playdate to happen in your yard. Explain to the owner that you are teaching your dog social skills and you think being in your dog's yard will help.
Stick to dogs that your dog knows or are familiar with at the beginning. Even if your dog and a dog at the dog park don't know each other well, if they have been around each other and interacted, this makes them familiar enough to interact.
Your playdate can be as simple as letting the dogs run around the yard together. You may want to bring out some toys and have them chase balls or frisbees.

, If you are adopting a dog to help your dog learn social skills, you want to go slow and use caution. This can be a great way to get your dog social with at least one other dog, but this can also end in disaster if your dog never warms up to the new dog. Ask yourself whether or not you believe forcing a new dog into your home is a good way for your dog to become social.


If you decide to do this, make sure to introduce the dogs slowly. Put them both on leashes and let them be around each other, sniff each other, and get to know each other. If either dog starts to get aggressive, remove them and try again later.
When adopting a new dog, make sure to get a dog who is not dog-aggressive. This will cause problems with your current dog.
It may take awhile for your dog to adjust to the new dog. As long as the two dogs are not aggressive towards one another, they may eventually come around to each other, no matter if they are young or old.

Find ways for your dog to meet new people and dogs.,
Help your dog overcome any social fears.",How to Maintain Social Skills in Older Dogs2," You may want to make a point to introduce your dog to different types of people.

Take your dog to places where they will see a few dogs one on one. You may try walking around a city park or your neighborhood. Don’t take them to a dog park until they are used to many dogs.

, To stay social, your dog needs to interact with new people and dogs. Seeing dogs or people they are familiar with doesn’t help them socialize more. Look for ways to increase your dog’s interactions.This may include going to parks, finding new walking routes, taking your dog with you on vacation, taking your dog for a hike, or bringing your dog to a family gathering.

, Some dogs end up scared of some people, like men or people wearing hats. If this is the case for your dog, you need to help socialize them with whatever scares them so they can get over the fear.

Consult a vet about changes in your dog's behavior.,
Make life easier on your dog.,
Consult an animal behavior expert.",How to Maintain Social Skills in Older Dogs4," An aging dog can develop problems with its senses, memory, and awareness of its surroundings. This can make the dog irritated, restless, anxious, and sometimes even aggressive. In many cases, there is an underlying disease or health problem making this worse.If your elderly dog has worse social skills than it did before, it's worth a visit to the vet., Once you've identified some of the issues your dog is having, whether through observation or a vet checkup, try to reduce the animal's stress however you can. If the dog is experiencing less pain or confusion, it will have an easier time in social interactions. Here are a few examples:

If your dog bumps into things or whines at night, its vision or spatial senses may have declined. See if its behavior improves if you leave dim lights on.If your dog has trouble reaching its usual spots, help it out. Maybe it needs a step stool to reach the couch, or a wider pathway between its bed and its food bowl.
Many older dogs develop different sleep schedules and energy levels, and may be restless at night or slow to move during the day. In both cases, it helps to spend more time on activities that are not physically taxing, such as longer walks, indoor games, and food puzzle toys., If the vet rules out a medical cause or the dog's social skills do not improve after treatment, visit an animal behavior therapist for advice and training. This is especially useful if you think your dog might have one of these behavior problems:Separation anxiety, leading to destructive behavior or panic when you leave the dog alone
Excessive howling and barking
New fear responses to certain sounds or objects
Aggression

Keep your routine consistent.,
Eliminate clutter in your home.",How to Know if Your Old Dog Stops Recognizing People," Dogs are generally capable of recognizing the faces of their owners and others they love. If your dog recognizes someone, it's likely to follow that person around, especially when greeting a person. If someone, say, enters a room that a dog knows, they'll generally follow them initially.If a friend walks in that your dog knows, it's normal for your dog to follow them for a few minutes.
If a dog has stopped recognizing someone, it's likely to remain indifferent when someone enters a room.;
, How does your dog behave in the presence of familiar people? A dog's body language in the presence of friends rather than strangers should be relaxed and friendly. If your dog seems nervous or aggressive around familiar people, it may no longer recognize them.A relaxed, friendly dog will have its ears forward, its head held high, its mouth slightly opened, and its tail down and wagging. A relaxed dog will also carry their body in a looser fashion. If your dog knows someone, it should generally be relaxed around that person.
A fearful or aggressive dog will lower its body. It will pin its ears back, wrinkle its nose, and keep its lips curled. This is not a normal reaction a dog should have in response to seeing people it knows.

, If your dog is generally calm around people, even new people, it's unlikely to behave in a fearful fashion if it stops recognizing people. However, your dog may simply not pay much attention to new people. If your dog seems uninterested in greeting or playing with familiar guests, it may be losing its ability to recognize people., If you suspect your dog is no longer recognizing people, pay attention to other ways your dog behaves. Cognitive decline can show up in other forms. If your dog is showing other symptoms of cognitive decline, this can help confirm your dog has indeed lost the ability to recognize people. One of the most common signs of cognitive decline is forgetting learned behaviors.Does your dog remember basic commands and tricks it learned? If your dog suddenly does not remember how to sit or roll over, this is a sign of cognitive decline. This should occur on a regular basis and not just be a one time misstep.
Your dog may also forget basic household manners. If your dog knows not to go in the kitchen while people are eating, and is suddenly consistently underfoot during meal times, for example, this can be a sign of cognitive decline.

, As dogs age, they may forget their potty training lessons. Your dog may forget that its not supposed to eliminate indoors. If your normally potty trained dog is suddenly going inside a lot, this can be a sign of cognitive decline.Bathroom issues can also be a sign of a physical problem, so it's important to get them evaluated by a veterinarian to rule out other causes.

, A dog that's developing cognitive decline may be confused and upset easily. This can often manifest itself in physical symptoms. While any physical changes should be evaluated by a vet, a dog experiencing cognitive decline may display some of the following behaviors:Trembling or shaking
Being easily startled
Pacing throughout the house
Sleeping more frequently

, A dog with cognitive decline may get confused simply navigating your home. Your dog may get trapped in your bedroom and be unable to find the door. Your dog may get lost coming from the living room to the kitchen for dinner., Symptoms of cognitive decline should always be evaluated by a veterinarian. Many symptoms can be indicative of an underlying health condition, which should be ruled out first. There is no cure for cognitive decline in older dogs, but your vet should be able to develop a treatment plan to slow down symptoms.Schedule an appointment with your vet. Let your vet know about the concerning changes in your dog's behavior.
Make sure you make a list of symptoms ahead of time. The more information you provide, the better advice your vet can give.
Your vet will do a general exam and, depending on your dog's symptoms, may want to run some blood work and other tests.

, Your vet will not be able to cure cognitive decline, but can make your dog's life easier by recommending a particular routine. A routine that combines daily exercise, play, and support can ease your dog's symptoms. Your vet may have specific recommendations for behavior modification techniques that can help your dog., In addition to lifestyle changes, in some cases medication or a special diet can help. Talk these options over with your vet to see if they're right for your dog.Make sure you ask your vet questions about any medications your dog is prescribed. Follow the instructions carefully and monitor your dog for side effects.
A special diet for cognitive decline is usually supplemented with certain vitamins and minerals shown to slow the symptoms. You may have to order special diet food online or get it at your vet's office.

, In order to minimize confusion for your dog, keep your routine consistent. Try not to make any sudden changes to your schedule and avoid changes to your household. Do not, for example, suddenly add a new couch, as this can confuse a dog suffering cognitive decline., It can be hard for a dog with cognitive decline to get around, so keep your home clear of clutter. Keep floors clear and do not leave items sitting out. Dogs with cognitive decline get lost and confused easily, so less clutter is important for your dog's health."

Learn about your breed’s susceptibility to the cold.,
Dress your dog in canine clothing.,
Use booties to protect your dog’s paws and feet.,
Take shorter walks when the weather is cold.",How to Keep an Older Dog Warm in Cold Weather1," Certain breeds of dogs will be more affected by the cold than others. Determine your breed’s susceptibility to the cold in order to know which precautions you need to take. Older dogs will always be a bit more sensitive than younger dogs of the same breed.In general, the larger your dog is, the better they will be at tolerating the cold.
The amount of fur your dog has plays a role as well. Breeds like malamutes, huskies, and chow chows, with thick coats, are particularly well suited for cold weather. Dogs with short hair, like chihuahuas, are quite sensitive to the cold.;
, One common and easy way to help keep your dog warm is to give them a dog sweater or jacket. These garments can help to keep your dog’s core warm and keep them comfortable. This can be a great option for older dogs who have trouble staying warm.Dog clothing is available at pet stores, specialty stores, and online.
Be sure to keep your dog’s clothing warm and dry. Damp sweaters or jackets can actually make your dog colder.

, An additional level of protection is to place warm booties on your dog’s feet. This can be especially helpful if your dog dislikes walking on the cold ground, or if you notice cracking or bleeding from their paws. This discomfort can be quite common in older animals, so consider placing booties on your senior dog., Senior dogs will be able to tolerate cold weather for short period of time, but is best not to overdo it. If the temperature is low or the conditions are wet and icy, consider taking a shorter walk than you would normally. Alternatively, if your dog can wait, you may postpone your walk until the weather clears up.It is a good idea to check the temperature before going out.If it is below freezing, you may want to postpone your walk.

Make sure you have the right type of crate.,
Walk the dog before kennel training.,
Choose a command word that you'll use each time you want your dog to get in its kennel.,
Make the crate seem comfortable.,
Start introducing the kennel to your dog in short sessions.,
Praise the dog for going in, not for coming out.,
Feed the dog in the crate.,
Try closing the dog in the crate for short periods of time.,
Try to let the dog out before it starts making noise.,
Don't leave the dog in the crate for extended period of time.,
Have patience.",How to Kennel Train an Older Dog That Barks," Wire crates are usually a good choice for most dogs. Make sure the dog can stand up completely and put his head up completely in the crate that you've chosen. Make sure the crate is large enough for the dog to turn around easily.


A good rule of thumb is to read the recommended size on the box the crate comes in and then get one size larger to account for growth and to provide for the comfort of your pet.;
, The best time to train an older dog is after a little bit of exercise, when it's been worn out a little. It's also good to give the animal an opportunity to do its business in the outdoors, before being locked in the kennel for any amount of time. Even if it's going to be a brief intro at first, it's important to establish a routine.


Keep in mind that old dogs might have difficulty holding in their waste over longer periods. An animal with full bowel control will usually avoid making a mess in their cage and don't want to sleep in their poop any more than you do.

, Popular choices are ""cage"" or ""kennel"" or ""kennel up."" Get your dog's attention, then use the command word. They won't have a clue what you're talking about at first, so gently lead them to the cage. Repeat your command word a few times while you do this.

, Put a comfortable blanket or dog bed in the crate and make sure that it is the most comfortable thing available for the dog to lie down on. This will make the dog more likely to voluntarily go into the crate.

, Once you have the correct equipment, you can start introducing your dog to the crate. You need to help the dog understand that the kennel is a safe place and not a punishment before you require the dog to stay in the kennel for a long period of time.


Begin by putting the kennel in the dog's space with the door left open all the time. When you first bring the crate home, don't put it together with the dog close by. A crate can seem very strange to a dog and can be intimidating. Instead, take the dog out of the area, assemble the crate, put it in a corner, and let the dog come check it out on his own terms.

, Do not ever praise the dog when you let the dog out. Instead, praise the dog as he goes in. When you let him out, say nothing. This helps to establish that going into the kennel is a good thing, and coming out is a normal and regular thing that the dog doesn't need to get excited about.

, Start by feeding the dog a few times in the crate, and leave the door wide open. At first, put the food bowl halfway into the crate, so the dog can eat with his body half in and half out of the crate. Gradually move the food to the back of the crate.


Once the dog willingly stands inside the crate to eat the whole meal, reach in and move the food bowl to the front of the crate. When the dog turns to face you, close the door halfway.
Let the dog continue to go in and out of the crate as he eats. You want to move the bowl so that you are not closing the door behind him. If he is facing you to eat, he can see what you are doing.

, When the dog is no longer apprehensive about being in the crate with the door halfway, begin leading the dog into the crate with a treat. Give the treat in the crate and close the door while he eats it. As soon as the dog is finished with the treat, let him out right away. Continue to feed all meals in the crate.


Gradually increase the amount of time the dog stays in the crate after the treat is finished, and until the dog is comfortable resting quietly in the crate. If the dog gets up and barks at five minutes, for example, let the dog out at four minutes for a while. Then slowly increase the time you wait.

, If you miss the chance, try to wait for the dog to stop barking briefly before you open the kennel. If you let the dog out every time he starts barking, you're teaching him to open the door by barking.

, Crates are ok for dogs to sleep in at night and to stay in for a little while during the day, but it's not a longterm solution to caring for your animal.


No dog should be left in the crate during the day for more than four hours at a time without exercise and potty breaks. Water should be available at all times and dogs that are new to crates should be supervised until they get used to being in left in the crate alone.
If your dog is barking, whining, drooling, panting, restless, standing or turning around continuously, or pawing at the door to get out, do not force the dog to stay inside.

, Unlike with puppies, which don’t have habits they’ve been forming for their entire lives, adult dogs may have spent years without ever entering a crate. This means they’re probably going to be a lot more resistant to the idea and may fight against it more. Your job is to bear with them and keep trying. Over time, most adult dogs will come to accept a crate with the right training.

Keep your dog inside.,
Provide adequate outdoor shelter.,
Keep bedding at least 3 inches off the floor.,
Provide a hot water bottle.",How to Keep an Older Dog Warm in Cold Weather2," When dogs are left outside, their ears, paws, and faces are especially prone to frostbite.The best way to keep your senior dog warm and healthy during the winter months is to keep them indoors. Older dogs are more sensitive to the cold than younger dogs, so it is a good idea to keep your senior dog inside your home, especially overnight., If your dog does spend a lot of time outside, be sure that they have proper outdoor housing. A good cold-weather doghouse should have a sloped roof, insulation, and possibly even a prefabricated (or expert-installed) heater. Keeping your dog outside should only be considered if they are hearty breed and used to the cold.Be sure to seal any cracks and insure proper insulation.

, Another great way to keep your senior dog warm and healthy is to make sure they have someplace comfortable to lay down, at least three inches off of the cold floor. Use a thick dog bed, or layer it with additional blankets to raise it up., If your senior dog is still chilly, you may want to provide them with a hot water bottle to cuddle with. You can find these at most pharmacies. Simply fill the bottle with warm water, and set it in your dog’s bed."
"
Groom your dog.,
Keep fur around the paws trimmed.,
Watch for frostbite.,
Pay attention to existing ailments.",How to Keep an Older Dog Warm in Cold Weather3," You will want to avoid trimming or shaving your dog’s fur during the winter months, because their full coat is a great source of warmth and protection. Instead, it is important to keep you dog’s coat brushed, groomed, and free of tangles. Matted fur is less effective at keeping your dog warm.Brush your dog’s fur daily to remove tangles.
Consider taking them to a professional groomer, but be sure to explain that you’d like their fur to be left long.

, The fur on your dog’s paws can trap ice, making your older dog cold and uncomfortable. Additionally, excess fur on the paws can make it easier for your dog to slip.Hold your dog’s paw with one hand, and use a sharp pair of scissors to snip off any fur that covers the pads of their foot.
You may also consider having this done by a professional groomer.

, Frostbite is a common occurrence, especially in small dogs. Frostbite can be easily treated if diagnosed immediately, so keep an eye out for symptoms.First-degree frostbite can be easy to miss. Look for pale skin on your dog’s extremities (such as ears, lips, tail, face, and feet). This skin may also feel cold to the touch. When the affected skin warms up, it can look red, swollen, and be painful to touch.
Second-degree frostbite involves the development of skin blisters.
Third-degree frostbite (the most serious) will involve your dog’s skin turning black or dark blue. You will see a clear difference between frostbitten and undamaged skin.
Seek medical attention right away if you recognize signs of frostbite on your dog.

, Existing ailments, such as arthritis, osteoporosis, and others, can be exacerbated by the cold. If your senior dog has been diagnosed with any of these, speak to your vet about any additional medications or treatments you should provide.Watch out for symptoms of pain, such as limping, lying down more than usual, or yelping when touched.
Speak to your vet to discuss symptoms and treatment options.

Keep the noise level lower.,
Avoid rapid movements.,
Hug gently.,
Understand that growls are warnings.",How to Keep Your Senior Dog Safe Around Young Kids1," Some older dogs can be easily frightened by loud noises. This is because their hearing has become weaker with age. When playing around older dogs, encourage kids to keep the noise level low and steady.You might say, ""Let's use our inside voices around Rex, because loud noises make him nervous."";
, Additionally, rapid movements may frighten some older dogs. This is because their eyesight is not as strong as it once was. When playing with an older dog, encourage kids to avoid jolting or rapid movements.Rather than playing fetch, older dogs may prefer a gentle game of tug-a-war, or some gentle petting.
You might say, ""Let's stay kind of calm around Rex. He doesn't like it when we jump around.""

, It is quite common for older dogs to experience arthritis or other forms of joint pain. As such, it is important to be gentle with them physically. Encourage kids to use a soft touch. If your dog enjoys hugs, do it gently.Some dogs simply don't enjoy hugs.
If your dog growls, yelps, or squirms away you may need to give them some space.

, If your senior dog feels stressed or uncomfortable, they may growl, bark, or snap. Understand that these actions are messages: your dog is trying to communicate their fear or discomfort. When your senior dog acts out like this, understand that you may need to alter their environment in some way.Begin by ensuring that noise and movement levels are steady.
Make sure your dog has adequate space and feels comfortable.

Choose an adult Rottweiler over a puppy if you have kids.,
Avoid adopting a Rottweiler puppy if you don’t want to deal with chewing.,
Adopt an adult Rottweiler if you don’t have time to house train a puppy.,
Choose an adult if you want to save a dog.",How to Adopt a Rottweiler1," Many people mistakenly believe it is better to adopt a Rottweiler puppy if you already have children. The rationale is that the puppy will adjust to the kids and their playfulness better than an adult dog.


Rottweiler puppies and children can be a difficult mix. The puppies have a ton of energy and are constantly nipping and biting at things. This can create problems when the puppy accidentally bites one of the kids or chews up the children’s favorite toys.
The other challenge with adopting a puppy is that you have no idea how the dog will behave as an adult. It might develop a difficult disposition that clashes with your family.
An adult Rottweiler’s personality and temperament are already developed, making it easier to observe how a particular Rottie will interact with and respond to your kids. With an adult dog, it is easier to select one that is a good fit for your family.;
, Just like any other puppy, Rottweiler pups enjoy chewing while teething and during playtime. They can end up destroying furniture, blankets, shoes, and other cherished items. Most adult Rotties will have already outgrown this behavior so there is less risk of your things being chewed up., While all puppies need to be house trained, Rottweilers are extremely energetic and can easily create havoc in your home. In addition to being taught to go to the bathroom outside, puppies also need to learn how to play appropriately inside. Otherwise, your new pup is likely to jump on the furniture, knock things over, and even destroy things. If you can’t be home during the day to train a Rottweiler puppy, your best bet is to adopt an adult., Older Rottweilers that end up in shelters or with rescue organizations might have been neglected or abused prior to being rescued.Unfortunately, adult Rottweilers can miss out on adoption because many people are looking to adopt or purchase puppies only. Adopting an adult Rottie is a great way to save a dog that would otherwise miss out on a great home.

Take your dog to the veterinarian.,
Receive a behavior evaluation.,
Get help from a shelter or rescue group.",How to Adopt Out a Shy Dog1," If you decide to put your dog up for adoption, you should research your local regulations. Some places have specific laws about adopting out animals that have a history of aggression. You will need to know what your liability is if the dog you give away ever bites someone.Some fearful and timid dogs can act violently if provoked.
Never give away an aggressive dog without professional help. Dogs with behavior problems take those problems with them to the next family, where they can get worse.;
, Before you begin advertising about your dog, you should take it to the veterinarian to have its health evaluated. Be sure to have your dog spayed/neutered and vaccinated, which will make it much more attractive to potential adopters. This will also help you get a better idea of what health concerns, if any, to discuss.Ask your veterinarian things like “how current are my dog’s vaccinations?” or “what chronic issues might my dog develop?”
Be sure to talk to your veterinarian about your dog’s temperament. If your dog’s temperament is the reason you are giving it up, they may suggest a medication or treatment to help it.

, If your dog has a serious behavioral problem, you may want to get it evaluated. There are pet specialists who diagnose dog behavioral disorders and recommend methods of dealing with them.One option a behaviorist might recommend is visiting a dog trainer. Getting any kind of temperamental problems under control will make your dog more attractive to potential adopters. For a shy dog, a trainer may suggest activities that will strengthen your dog’s confidence and make them more social.If you are putting your dog up for adoption because of its shyness, understand that some dogs can be trained out of their timidity.

, Consider calling a local shelter or rescue group early in the process. They will likely have tips to help you market your dog to potential adopters. These groups are accustomed to finding homes for animals and should be a valuable resource.Ask the shelter volunteer things like “what are some good methods for advertising my dog?” or “how can your group help me get the word out about my dog?”

Communicate with kids.,
Don’t leave them unsupervised.,
Enlist kids to help.,
Be careful not to overdo it.",How to Keep Your Senior Dog Safe Around Young Kids2," Before you allow kids to interact with your senior dog, you should explain your dog's needs and set some guidelines. Explain the ways in which the kids can help you to keep them comfortable and safe.You might say, ""Two things that really bother Rex are super loud noises and quick movements. What do you think we can do to help him stay comfortable?""
Show them how to touch your dog gently. You might say, ""Rex has a lot of pain in his joints, so you have to be careful when you touch him. He only likes to be petted like this.""
You might say,""Keep an eye on how Rex is feeling. If he seems unhappy or angry, or if he growls or yelps, give him some space and come let me know.""

, Whenever kids are with your senior dog, be sure that at least one adult is around. Even if your senior dog has no history of misbehaving with children, it is best to keep their interactions supervised., One of the best ways to get kids to understand your dog’s needs is to ask for their help with special tasks. The more they get involved in improving your dog's quality of life, the greater understanding they will have of their specific needs.Small kids can help make sure your dog's bed is cozy for naptime.
Older kids can help you build a ramp for your dog to climb stairs.

, Many dogs have been shown to push themselves through physical pain in order to make their owner (or other friends) happy. When it comes to senior dogs, this can lead to real physical damage. Be sure that kids do not overwork your senior dog. Consider setting a time limit on how long they can play.A good rule of thumb is to limit the play time to 30-45 minutes.
This time limit will vary from dog to dog.

Look into their history.,
Consider their breed.,
Pay attention for signs of stress in your dog.",How to Keep Your Senior Dog Safe Around Young Kids3," Before you bring your senior dog around children, you should have some sense about your dog’s experience with children, and whether or not your dog likes kids. The degree to which your dog has been socialized plays a major role in how they act around children. If you have acquired your senior dog late in life, try to find out all you can about their previous owner(s) and how much time, if any, they have spent around children.Speak to the shelter where you acquired your dog.
Talk to you vet about any history they may know.
If possible, speak directly to a previous owner.

, Certain breeds of dogs have more patience with children than others. This is true in senior dogs, as well. Beagles, labs, Newfoundlands, and English bulldogs, for example, are known for being great with kids. Weimaraners, rottweilers, and terriers, on the other hand, are not known for their patience. Take this into consideration when you bring your senior dog around children. Dogs with a lower tolerance for child behavior may become frustrated more easily and act out., Anytime you bring your senior dog into a new situation, particularly one involving kids, you need to watch out for signs of stress or discomfort. Your senior dog may become frightened, feel threatened, or be in pain. This could cause them to act out or even bite.Prior to acting out or biting, your dog may:


Emit a low growl
Show their teeth
Perk up their ears
Lift their tail up, possibly wagging stiffly

You can give one of these amazing dogs a much needed second chance at happiness.


When adopting a Rottweiler from a foster home, the foster family can tell you if the dog is good with children or other pets.
Many adult Rottweilers available for adoption are housebroken and have already been trained., Many shelters and rescue centers charge an adoption fee, which can range from a few dollars to a few hundred.


Additional costs of dog ownership include things like food, walking supplies, toys, grooming supplies, regular vet checkups, booster shots, and unexpected expenses.

, Rottweilers are smart dogs, but they are also big and strong. Their size and strength can be problematic if they have a difficult temperament or have not been properly raised or trained.Educate yourself about the breed before bringing home a Rottie.

, In the excitement of adopting a new Rottie, it’s easy to get carried away and want the first one you see. Take your time to ensure a good fit for both you and the dog.


Adoption staff are trained to evaluate the temperament and personality of each dog in order to match them with the right family., There is a process to adopting a Rottweiler that includes criteria you and your home must meet for the adoption to be approved. You’ll be asked several questions about yourself, your home, and your family. Your answers help adoption staff place Rottweilers in permanent homes with loving families that are a good fit for one another.Staff will probably ask whether or not you have other pets and if everyone in the home is looking forward to the adoption.

Be sure you have the time to devote to a new dog before bringing one home. This includes time for walks, play, and visits to the vet., Many landlords do not allow dogs or other pets. Even if they do, they might not allow specific dog breeds, such as Rottweilers. If you rent your home, review your lease or check with your landlord before bringing home a new dog.

, Some insurance companies will not insure homes with Rottweilers and other large dog breeds. Your homeowner’s or renter’s insurance policy could be cancelled if that is the case. Review your policy or check with your insurance company to make sure having a Rottweiler isn’t a problem., Rottweilers need space to run around and play outdoors.

Be honest about your dog.,
Take some pictures and create a profile.,
Contact the place where you got the dog.,
Ask your family and friends.,
Advertise on social media.,
Place an advertisement.",How to Adopt Out a Shy Dog2," Because you have a shy dog, you will need to be up front about its temperament. Let potential adopters know that it is timid and fearful of people or other dogs. It is important that you avoid misleading people about your dog’s behavior. This is unethical and can be dangerous.Make sure that you do not undersell your pet’s timidity. If the adopters find that your dog is too shy for their liking, they may try to give it back to you or send it to a shelter.

, Once you have your dog cleaned up, you should take some photographs of it and upload them to a pet adoption website. Take a few close up pictures of your dog’s face, as well as a few shots of its entire body. Upload them to a pet adoption site and then share your pet’s profile on social media and in any prospective online advertisements. You will want to convey to potential adopters your dog’s physical health and general look.Groom your dog before you put it up for adoption. A clean dog will be more attractive to potential adopters than a dirty one. You can do this grooming yourself, or you can take your dog to a professional.
Be sure to take photos that accurately capture your dog’s behavior. Do not take a picture of your dog running with someone and give it a caption of “Frank really loves people.” This is disingenuous and misleading.
Many pet adoption services allow you to make a profile of your dog that they will host on their website. A pet profile may also attract potential adopters.

, One of the first things you should do when advertising your dog is to contact the place where you originally got it. If you got it from a breeder, they should help you find your animal a new home. If it is a rescue dog, many shelters and rescue groups will take an animal back regardless of how much time has passed.A rescue group or shelter may also help spread the word about your dog by posting its information to their website or directing potential adopters to you.Ask them things like “do you help people rehome dogs?” or “are there any services that you can recommend for pet adoption?”

, The first natural place to begin looking for potential adopters is among your family and friends. You know these people already, so your vetting process will not have to be as thorough. Moreover, it is easy for you to get in contact with them. Simply call, text or email any friends or family members that you believe might be interested in your dog.Consider talking to anyone who has already expressed interest in the dog.

, You can also post your dog’s information on social media. Share your dog’s profile information and any photos you may have on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or any other social media platform you use. You can also ask your friends and family to share your dog’s information in order to reach even more people., You can also place a spot in your local newspaper advertising your dog. Include your dog’s profile and your contact information. You may also consider putting an ad on Craigslist. Again, be sure to include information about your dog as well as the best way to contact you.When putting out a public advertisement like this, you should always ask for a fee. Some people take free dogs and resell them to medical researchers or dog fighting groups. A fee is an insurance policy against your dog going to one of these people.

Ask potential adopters to send you background information.,
Conduct some interviews.,
Let the potential adopter meet the dog.",How to Adopt Out a Shy Dog3," Once potential adopters begin contacting you, you will want to get some background information. Ask them to send you proof of employment, living situation and veterinarian. Have the potential adopters send you photocopies of documents like a pay stub and their lease. They should also forward you their veterinarian’s contact information.You might say something like “would you mind sending me a copy of a pay stub from your work?” or “would you share your veterinarian’s contact info with me?”

, You may want to meet any potential adopters in person. This will help you get a better feel for the people interested in adopting your dog. Go over some of the information you had the potential adopter send you, such as their work life and veterinary situation. You should also ask about their living and work situation, who will be the dog’s primary caregiver and if the dog has access to a yard or park.You might ask “what happened to your previous pets?” and “are all of your animals spayed and neutered?”
Ask them things like “how many pets do you currently own?” and “do you have any experience with shy dogs?”
During the interview you might ask “how many hours a week do you work?” or “do you live in an apartment or a house?”
Some other questions to ask are “how often will the dog be outside?” and “do you have any children?”

, If you conduct the interview in person, you should also allow the potential adopter to meet your dog. Observe how they interact with the animal and how your dog responds to them. Although your dog is shy and is generally timid, if they act particularly fearful around this person, they are probably not a good fit. Trust your dog’s instincts when vetting any potential adopters."

Research your local shelters.,
Contact the shelter or rescue group.,
Surrender your dog.",How to Adopt Out a Shy Dog4," If you cannot find an adopter for your dog, your only other option may be surrendering it. Be choosy when looking at shelters and rescue groups. Many shelters and groups are understaffed and overcrowded with dogs waiting to get homes. Because of this, a large majority of the animals are put to sleep. There are “no-kill” shelters that will not kill your dog. However, they also tend to be overcrowded and are less likely to take your dog. Make sure that you find a place for your dog that will care for it.Avoid taking your dog to a pound. Most pounds will only hold the dog for a few days before putting it down.

, Once you have found shelters or rescue groups to contact, you should give them a call and find out more about their situation.

You might also want to ask “what happens to dogs that are not adopted?” and “what is the living situation like for your dogs?’

, Once you have found a shelter or rescue group, arrange a time to surrender your dog. Most shelters and groups have their own policies, but your appointment should only last about an hour. You will bring your dog in, it will receive a quick medical evaluation and then you will sign a form surrendering it.Be sure that you understand the policies of the shelter or rescue group.
Most shelters or rescue groups will try to work with you to avoid having you surrender the dog. Volunteer staff may explore options for you to keep the dog or find someone else to take it.

Read about a hound's temperament and personality.,
Research a hound dog's needs.,
Spend time around hound dogs.,
Talk with a vet about any medical issues.",How to Adopt a Hound Dog1," Hound dogs are intelligent and energetic dogs that may be difficult to train. Since they're pack animals they need the company of other dogs or shouldn't be left alone for long periods of time. Hound dogs are noted for their ability to hold a scent and track prey, so you'll need to keep them leashed or fenced when outdoors. Consider researching one of these popular breeds of hound dog:Coonhound
Foxhound
Basset hound
Bloodhound
Greyhound;
, Most hound dogs have high energy levels, so they'll need a lot of exercise. Since they are intelligent hunting dogs, you'll also need to give them plenty of mental stimulation. You'll need to research the specific type of hound dog you want to adopt in order to determine how much food they'll need and how large they'll grow.You should also find out what activities the hound dog you want is interested in. For example, some breeds are used for tracking, hunting, or running.

, The best way to tell if a hound dog is right for you is to just be around them. This will give you a good idea of how they interact with you and other dogs. Go to pet stores and ask to sit with the hound dogs, ask friends if they have hound dogs you could visit with, or go to the adoption agency to see the dogs they have.


Taking the time to interact with the dogs before you adopt one is also good practice for caring for a pet. You'll need to invest your time in taking care of an adopted hound dog.

, Once you've narrowed your list to a few different breeds, ask the veterinarian about any congenital conditions they may inherit. This way, you can be prepared about what kind of care you might need to give your hound dog.


For example, if you're considering a Blue Tick Hound, the vet may tell you that they often have cartilage problems in their joints and may develop neurological conditions.
You can also use the Humane Society's online database to search a breed's genetic predispositions."

Close off any rooms you don’t want your newly adopted Rottweiler to go in.,
Create a space in the home that is just for your Rottweiler.,
Establish a routine and stick to it.,
Provide time for daily exercise.,
Tell visitors to let your Rottweiler approach them when he’s ready.,
Reward your dog for good behaviors.",How to Adopt a Rottweiler4," Before bringing your new Rottie home, decide if he will have access to the entire house. If not, be sure to keep doors closed or set up baby gates to keep the dog out of restricted areas.Even if the dog will have full run of the house, it might be a good idea to restrict certain areas until your dog is used to its new home and isn’t having any bathroom accidents inside.

, Set up a dog bed or crate where your new Rottie can take time out away from everyone whenever he needs it. It can take dogs adopted from shelters up to two months to fully adjust to their new home.Make sure your Rottie has its own space.

, Routines work great for many different types of dogs, and work especially well with Rottweilers. By creating a routine, your new Rottie will learn what to expect throughout the day, which will help him adjust to his new home more quickly. The routine should also help your Rottie feel more secure in his new surroundings.Feed your Rottweiler at the same times each day.
Take him out to use the bathroom around the same times each day. Although, if he indicates he needs to go, take him out right away even if it is not the usual time.
Walk your Rottweiler or take him out to play around the same times every day. For instance, if you plan to walk your dog first thing in the morning, be consistent with that daily.

, Rottweilers are extremely energetic and require regular exercise to expend all that energy.Schedule daily outdoor playtime to give your Rottie enough exercise. If you don’t have your own yard, try taking your dog to a nearby park where he can stretch out and run around.


Activities your Rottie is likely to enjoy include taking walks, jogging with you, playing fetch, and even swimming., Just as your new Rottie will need time to adjust to you and your family, he will also need to get used to any visitors you have. When friends, family, or neighbors stop by, introduce them to your dog, then have them give the dog space. They might want to pet or play with your Rottie right away, but ask them to wait. Your Rottweiler will approach them when he’s ready to get to know them., The best way to get your new Rottweiler to continue behaving the way you want is to offer a reward. Let your new Rottweiler know when he’s done something positive by verbally praising him, petting him, or giving him a treat. Rewarding your dog a treat right after the desired behavior, lets him know he should do that again in the future."

Take your dog to its first vet exam and get it vaccinated.",How to Adopt a Toy Breed Dog," First, choose if you want a specific toy breed or just want to go with a mix of breeds. Think about how much time you have to play with your dog, and the kind of space you have available.Affenpinschers, Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, and Yorkshire Terriers make great lap dogs and are among the most popular toy breeds. Chihuahuas and Maltese are affectionate and playful, but also make great alarm systems because of their fearlessness and yipping.
Some toy breeds, like Italian Greyhounds and Miniature Pinschers, have high activity levels. You’ll need to take them on lots of walks and find spaces for them to sprint, especially if you live in an apartment or don’t have a yard.;
, Toy breeds and other small dogs aren't the best choice if you have a toddler or small child. Even though their intentions might be playful, younger children can be too rough for a fragile toy breed.Also consider the amount of free time you have. Most toy breeds are affectionate lap dogs that love to be with their owners and don't do well during long periods of isolation. Think about whether you'll have time to train and socialize a puppy, or if an older dog that might have health issues would require medical care out of your budget.

, While most toy dogs are happy and healthy, a variety of health problems are common in these breeds. Monitor your dog or potential dog for signs of shoulder, knee, and hip problems, like limping, hesitance, or obvious pain when walking or jumping.Toy breeds are prone to gum diseases, so you'll need to brush their teeth at least three times a week.
Your dog's vet can also monitor your dog for signs of common heart and liver problems.

, A breed rescue group is one of the best places to adopt a dog of a specific breed. For example, you can search online for “Yorkshire Terrier breed rescue groups near” wherever you live.


If you live in the United States, you can also check the American Kennel Club website for a substantial list of breed rescue groups organized by breed., Check out your local shelters and look around for toy breeds or mixes. You can find a local shelter’s contact information online or in your phone book. Give them a call and find out if they have specific hours during which you can drop by to see the dogs.In the United States, you can also find your local shelters by entering your zip code into the search tool on The Shelter Project: http://theshelterpetproject.org/shelters/


, Whether you adopt your dog or purchase it from a breeder, there should be some form of contract or paperwork involved. It should discuss any spay or neuter agreement you’ve made, as well as any adoption or vaccination fees you’re responsible for paying.It should also include instructions on how to care for your dog, and information about any specific health requirements.
Make sure you understand whether you’ll be responsible for providing vaccinations, initial veterinary exams, and spaying or neutering. Some shelters will provide assistance with these or waive adoption fees during certain times of the year.

, Put away anything that you wouldn’t want your new dog to chew or destroy, since it might not be familiar yet with your house rules. Try to move electrical cords out of view or make them inaccessible for a curious new dog that loves to chew.Remember that toy breeds are typically fragile, so make sure all furniture, lamps, knick-knacks, and other household objects are secure and won't fall onto the dog.
Keep houseplants, which might be toxic, out of chewing range.
Consider using baby gates to cut off areas without closing doors that you don’t want your new dog to enter.
Put the toilet lid down.

, Before taking the dog home, ask the shelter or rescue group what they’ve been feeding the dog. Try to keep its diet consistent, and stick with what it’s been eating if the brand is affordable and matches your standards.If you want to switch up its food, go with food marked for toy breeds and, if applicable, for puppies. You can also discuss its diet with your dog’s vet during the initial exam.

, Go to your local pet store for a breed-appropriate collar. Consider having tags made with your contact information and the dog’s name, if you’ve already given it one.While you’re at the pet store, grab a leash and a few toys, like a ball, chew bone, and plush toys. It’s important to offer your dog designated things for chewing so it learns to stay away from your socks and shoes.

, Your dog will need a safe, comfortable place, like a dog bed or pile of blankets. Consider investing in a size-appropriate crate and crate train your dog, especially if it’s a puppy.Since they’re den animals, dogs can actually find lots of comfort in a crate, as long as you don’t use the crate as a form of punishment.
If you have a short-haired breed, like an Italian Greyhound, consider investing in a bed with a hood. These are designed for dogs that might need a little extra warmth.

, Since their teeth are so sensitive to disease, you'll need a small dog toothbrush. Alternatively, you can use gauze to clean your dog's teeth. Never use human toothpaste, as fluoride toothpaste can upset your dog's stomach.Use either water to clean your dog's teeth or a toothpaste from your local pet store that's marked for dogs.
Chew toys and rawhide that's marked for dental can also help prevent oral diseases.

, If you find the temperature outside cold, so will your short-haired toy. Invest in a breed-specific jacket that will help keep your dog warm when you take it out for walks during cold weather. You can find jackets marked for specific breeds online or at your local pet store.Try to avoid jackets that cover the legs or otherwise restrict movement.

, You should invest in a dog carrier, since your first few months of dog ownership will probably involve trips to the vet for an initial exam and, perhaps, for spaying or neutering. You might also want to take it to the homes of family and friends to show off your new friend.You should always travel with your dog in a carrier, with one exception. If its first trip in a car is when you take your new dog home for the first time, you should have someone hold it in a towel or blanket to help calm it.

, First, to prevent any accidents on the car ride, put its leash on and take it outside to go to the bathroom. If the dog has never been in a car before, it will likely experience anxiety and motion sickness. You should have someone hold it in a blanket or towel to distract and soothe it.Toys have small bladders and you might need to stop on the way home, depending on the length of the car ride. Remember to avoid areas that other dogs frequent if your new dog has not yet been vaccinated or if its vaccines aren't yet active.   

, If you have already have a dog or other pet, introduce them by taking it slow and by first using scent articles. Then, keeping them leashed, consider introducing them through a baby gate. Otherwise, show your new dog where its food, water, and bed are located, and give it time to adjust and explore its new home.Remember toys are usually fragile, so never leave it alone with your resident dog or younger child.

, Ask friends or family members who own pets for a recommendation. You can also ask the shelter or breed group for a referral to a good vet. A breed group can be a great way to find a vet who’s especially familiar with your dog’s specific breed.If you have a few good recommendations, look up their hours and cost. Choose the vet that’s well-recommended, cost-effective, and most convenient for your location and schedule.

, If the shelter or rescue group hasn’t already, get your dog vaccinated against rabies, parvovirus, and other required core vaccinations. Your vet will tell you what’s required for your jurisdiction, and will offer your dog an initial physical exam.You and your dog’s vet can also discuss spaying or neutering and set up an appointment for the procedure.

Find a reputable hound dog adoption agency.,
Select a hound dog.,
Fill out the adoption application.,
Pay any adoption fees.,
Submit your personal references.",How to Adopt a Hound Dog2," Ask the veterinarian to recommend a local animal shelter that frequently has hounds. Ensure that the shelter is a registered 501(c)(3) charity and is run by a board of directors. The shelter should have volunteers working with the animals and the animals should be well taken care of.The animal shelter should be clean, well-run, and organized. The animals shouldn't be crowded and they should get medical attention while they're at the shelter.

, Visit the animal shelter and spend time looking at the hounds they have up for adoption. Once you think you've found a hound you'd like to adopt, take the time to play with it and get to know it a little. You should also spend time with several other hounds even if you think you've made up your mind about one hound. This will give you a chance to compare personalities and temperaments.


Don't feel rushed to choose a hound on the first visit. If you don't feel a strong connection to a hound, you can always wait a little bit and return.

, While your specific shelter or agency's application may be unique, most adoption applications will ask for your basic contact information. They'll also want to know about your home environment so they can ensure that the dog will be in a safe environment and will be looked after. Most applications also ask for:Employment information
Who lives in your house (other pets and people)
How much time and money you expect to spend on your hound
Landlord permission to own pets (if you're renting)

, Check with the shelter about any fees they charge to adopt a hound dog. Usually, these fees go towards giving the dog medical treatment. For example, the hound dog may get spayed or neutered, be tested for heart worm, get vaccinations, be microchipped, and get any preventative treatments (like flea control).Fees may vary depending on the age of the hound dog. Be prepared to pay several hundred dollars in fees to adopt your dog.

Bring all the things you’ll need.",How to Adopt a Greyhound," Spend some time studying the characteristics of greyhounds to see if it is the right kind of dog for you to adopt. Greyhounds are sight hunters, and most greyhounds available for adoption have been taught to race by chasing a lure, which is either mechanical or live. It is in the greyhounds' nature to chase things.This means that they may almost compulsively chase things (like a squirrel running along the fence or another pet you have at home) and will need some patience and training to outgrow this habit.
Greyhounds can be a good fit for households with children; however, if you have very young or overly active children, it might not be such a good idea to adopt a greyhound. They have such little padding and thin skin that children who aren’t careful with them could easily injure these dogs.
Racing greyhounds have been handled extensively but have typically not been taught to play.
Greyhounds have oftentimes grown accustomed to the company of other greyhounds. They may need to have a companion dog.;
, Greyhounds are special dogs with particular physical needs in their home environment. A potential greyhound owner needs to be aware of these circumstances before committing to adoption.Greyhounds have very little body fat. They are sensitive to cold and wet and cannot be left outside during the winter months. They are also sensitive to extreme heat, as with other dogs, so they should not be left outside during very warm periods.
Greyhounds need a fenced yard. Although most will not jump, a four to six foot fence is recommended for greyhounds by most organizations. They cannot be chained as they can literally break their necks because they can sprint up to 45 mph (72 km/h).
Surprisingly, greyhounds don’t require a lot of exercise. A daily walk and an occasional chance to take a short run around a fenced yard will satisfy their need for activity. Otherwise, they can be quite the couch potatoes., Greyhounds are prone to certain medical conditions that other breeds of dogs may not experience. These are possibilities that you will need to be aware of when adopting a greyhound.Greyhounds are very sensitive to barbiturates, flea products, and worm products. They must be treated carefully when they undergo routine preventative examinations.
Greyhounds, particularly former racers, seem to be more prone to bone cancer than other breeds.
Many greyhounds exhibit hypothyroidism (low levels of the thyroid hormone).
Greyhounds are also prone to bloat (flipping of the stomach).

, There are many sources online that list greyhound adoption agencies or greyhound rescues by state or country. There are also national greyhound adoption agencies that will adopt dogs all over the United States. Similar organizations exist in the UK and other countries.


You can search the National Greyhound Adoption Program or any other local agencies found by searching by state on the Greyhound Adoption Agency Directory.You can also try searching at local municipal animal shelters, especially kill shelters, because sometimes abandoned greyhounds can be found at places like this.

, Once you find an agency that you like, schedule a time to go meet the dogs that are available for adoption. It’s important to make sure your personality meshes with the dog’s in person. This will help limit any surprises when you get the dog home and ensure a lasting match between you and your new canine friend.


This might also happen the other way around. You might find a specific dog online that you’re interested in which leads you to the specific agency you’ll be adopting from.
You should never adopt a dog sight unseen.

, The application asks general questions as well as more specific questions about other pets, home environment, and family questions. This is to help determine the best dog to fit into your home environment and situation.The application may ask you to agree to certain conditions of owning a greyhound. This may include such things as agreeing to keep the dog's vaccinations current, keeping the dog licensed, and adequately exercising the dog.
Most agencies will also require you to agree to return the greyhound to them if you are unable or unwilling to keep the dog. These greyhounds will be rehomed with another family. This measure is to prevent greyhounds from ending up in municipal or other shelters.

, Some adoption agencies may require you to provide references, such as from a veterinarian or landlord. They want to make sure that you will provide a safe and happy home for your adopted greyhound.If you have one, ask your veterinarian to provide you with a reference regarding your history of care for any existing pets you have. This is the kind of information the agency will want to hear from your reference.

, Send in the adoption application, with the adoption fee if required. The fee usually goes toward (but does not completely cover) spaying/neutering, microchipping, and vaccinations. The fee is usually around $300.Some groups will not require payment of a fee until a greyhound is available for you. Follow the specific instructions of the group you are adopting from.
A sales tax may be applied to the adoption fee., Allow two to three weeks for the adoption process. This may take longer if you have specific requests in a dog – such as age, sex, or a dog that is good with children, cats, or other pets.The agency will contact you when they have reached a decision.

, Purchase food as recommended by the adoption agency and any special needs that they state the dog requires.Most greyhounds that have raced have been crate-trained, and you may need to purchase a large crate that will give your dog a place of its own until it becomes accustomed to your home and family routine.
Many adoption groups use ""foster"" homes for greyhounds awaiting adoption, so a crate may not be necessary.
Purchase a bed, collar, leash, as well as food and water dishes.
Wide, Martingale-style collars are recommended for greyhounds because of their particular anatomy. These collars are less likely to choke the greyhound or allow the greyhound to slip out.

, Make a plan for picking up your adopted greyhound, and make travel arrangements to get there. It is probably a good idea to arrive by car, if possible, so that your greyhound can travel comfortably in the car on the drive home.If you are going to an agency to pick up the dog, make sure there is a specific person you are supposed to meet at a specific time.
If the dog is at an individual’s house, make sure you arrange with them ahead of time when you will arrive.

, Make sure you bring all the necessary things with you when you go to pick up your new greyhound companion. Take a crate with you (if recommended), as well as a collar and leash.Consider the length of travel time to make sure you have all of the required supplies. For example, if there will be a long drive home you might want to consider bringing some food and water, along with food and water dishes, so that you can keep your greyhound satisfied and happy on the journey.

Many people are unaware of how much time and attention are required to help the dog grow into a well-behaved family member. A German shepherd can become destructive and aggressive without at least one mature pack leader who is confident but not abusive.This means that you need the time to attend obedience classes, practice socialization techniques, encourage exercise, play and train the dog every day.;
, German shepherds tend to share common traits such as extreme intelligence, protectiveness and loyalty, but some are better suited as laid-back family companions while others thrive as high-energy, working dogs.

, Adult German shepherds are big dogs that require exercise and movement. In addition, all German shepherds shed heavily twice a year. If a large, shedding dog does not appeal to your aesthetic tastes, adopting a German shepherd may not be the right dog for you.You need to commit to exercising your dog regularly, so if you do not like to get outside and exercise, then a German shepherd may not be for you.

, Approaching a rescue group is ideal because they pull the most promising dogs from animal shelters with the least amount of behavioral issues. They can tell you more about the individual personality of the dog and provide the follow-up support needed after the adoption process is complete.


Search online for the German shepherd rescue groups that are in your area. However, you can also contact groups in outlying areas that you would be willing to travel to.

, Read about their personalities and histories in the profiles on the shelter and rescue group's websites. Look for qualities that are a good match to your lifestyle and personality.Pay particular attention to the dog's energy level, obedience background, estimated age, and existing health issues. These should all be included in the description online.

, Keep in mind that these groups are sparsely staffed and may not be able to get back to you immediately. Follow up with a phone call or email if you do not hear back in a week or so.When you go to contact the rescue organization follow the directions they have listed on their website. Some organizations will have you will out a form while others will simply have you send an email describing what dog you are interested in.
If your potential dog is at a shelter you can usually call them and ask to place a hold on a dog until you can come and meet it in person.

, Rescues and shelters will require that you fill out a thorough application before your get a dog. These applications screen out people who are not prepared or unable to properly care for a dog.


Applications vary but they usually include questions about your housing situation, your yard, and basic questions about your ability to care for a dog.
Many people and institutions consider German shepherds to be a dangerous breed. Usually renters must show proof to a rescue organization that their landlord will allow them to keep a German shepherd in the home. Homeowners may need to confirm that their homeowners insurance company will allow a German shepherd to live on the premises. If they do, your premiums could increase.

, They need time to determine if the dog you want is a good fit for you and your lifestyle. They will verify that any existing dogs are certifiably healthy and well-cared for by your veterinarian, as well as whether you can financially care for a dog.


The rescue group will also likely come to your home before you meet the dog to ensure you have the proper accommodations, such as a fenced yard.
Some people see this process as intrusive and an obstacle to finding the dog a home but ultimately the rigorous screening process ensures the greatest chances of success for everyone by matching the right dog to the best owner.

, You will be allowed to meet the rescue dog in person once you, your home, and family are approved by the rescue group. If you have any existing pets you'll want to make sure they get along with the adoptee.


If you are adopting from a shelter, you will probably meet the dog before you apply to adopt it.

, Stock up on supplies when your application is approved. Before bringing home your dog you will need a flat collar and new dog's ID tags attached to it. You'll also need a leash, food and water bowls, a crate that is suitably-sized for full-grown German shepherds, a dog bed, food, and safe chew toys.It is best to wait to buy supplies until you are sure that you are getting the dog you applied for.

, You will need to pay the rescue organization or shelter fees before you will be allowed to bring the dog home. Once you do, you will be free to take your new family member home.


Immediately after bringing your German shepherd rescue dog home, contact the trainer recommended by the rescue or shelter organization and schedule time for your first obedience classes. Taking a comprehensive training course is the first step toward achieving a loving, lasting bond with your shepherd.

Check your breeder’s background and meet with them before you adopt to ensure that you are getting a healthy puppy from a happy and well-cared-for mother.The breeder’s facilities should be clean and all dogs should be healthy, clean, and free of parasites.
A good breeder will screen breeding stock for common health problems before breeding and will be happy to share that information with you. DNA tests should have been done on both parents. Ask for proof that these screening tests have been performed before you adopt.
When you find a breeder you want, wait for a litter to become available.
A good breeder will require a sales agreement that clearly spells out the obligations expected from all parties with respect to the dog. The breeder should also be able to suggest books, grooming equipment, pet care supplies, and more for the care of your future pet.

Food and water dishes
A collar or harness
A leash
ID tags for your new pet
A crate or carrier
A dog bed
Dog toys
Preventative medicines such as heartworm prevention and flea and tick prevention
Weather-appropriate wear such as a jacket or boots if you live in a cold climate.

Puppies separated from their mother before this may be fearful or could have some developmental complications.
Get your dog into the vet as soon as possible after adopting. This will allow your vet to meet your new pet, and make recommendations for care based off the dog’s current condition as well as likely future needs.

, If you want your dog to have purebred papers, you will need to register them. Do some research on the various kennel clubs that exist in your area. Find out how they register dogs and set guidelines for dog breeds.

Look for programs catering to your pet’s special needs, such as puppy training or rescued pet training.

Avoid dehydration.",How to Keep Orphaned Newborn Puppies Warm," An orphaned puppy that has gotten cold needs to be warmed gradually. Warming it too quickly can cause it to go into shock, which can further threaten its life.Instead of quick warming, gradually increase the puppies temperature over the course of a half hour to an hour.;
, If the orphaned puppies are not kept warm they can get hypothermia very quickly. Use a hot water bottle filled with warm water or a heating pad set to low to warm the puppy. Put a towel or blanket in between the heat source and the puppy to make sure the heating is gentle enough.You need to make sure that the heat source is not too hot for the puppy. If you think it is too hot, place another layer of blanket or towel between the heat source and the puppy or turn down the heat.

8 to 14 days old - 80º to 85ºF
15 to 21 days old - 75º to 80ºF
22 to 28 days old - 70º to 75ºF

100º to 102ºF (37.8º to 38.9ºC) at four weeks old and after

Once you decide you want to adopt a fostered dog you located at an adoption event, you’ll need to fill out the necessary paperwork. There will be an interim period while your paperwork is being processed before the dog is actually placed with you.

, If you want to adopt a fostered dog, you’ll need to complete an extensive questionnaire. This paperwork helps the humane society, animal shelter, or similar agency determine whether you’re qualified to adopt a fostered dog. Questions you might see on the adoption paperwork include:Why do you want to adopt a dog?
Are you looking for a puppy or an older dog?
Do you plan on moving soon?

, When you adopt a fostered dog, you’ll have to meet them and their foster family. This will give the foster family a chance to learn more about your character and temperament in order to determine if you’re a good fit for their fostered dog. It will also give you a chance to see if the fostered dog’s temperament and personality are a good match for you.Ask the foster family questions about the fostered dog’s habits and behavior when meeting them. For instance, you might ask if the dog is housetrained, if it chews furniture and books, and if it knows any tricks.
Schedule a meeting with the foster family and fostered dog you’re interested in as soon as possible. Otherwise, other families might adopt the fostered dog before you.
You might be able to reach the foster family by email or phone.

, When you show up to your meet-and-greet, bring a dog collar and leash with you. Since you’ve already been approved by the adoption agency, you should be able to head home to your fostered dog that very day.You’ll have to fill out some paperwork before taking your dog home if you attended an adoption event. You likely won’t be able to take the dog home until your paperwork is processed, even if you’re ahead of anyone else on the adoption list.

, Once you’ve decided to take the dog home, you’ll have a fill out a few more documents. These are much briefer and more limited in scope than the application you initially completed in order to adopt the dog. The documents basically constitute a contract that makes you legally responsible for the health of the fostered dog from that point on.Along with the final adoption paperwork, you’ll need to pay an adoption fee.The adoption fee for a particular organization will vary. Ask a knowledgeable representative of the organization what the adoption fee for your dog will be.

Wait until your puppy is several months old.,
Have a female puppy spayed before its first estrus.,
Look for clues about age, if age is uncertain.,
Consult with your veterinarian.",How to Know if a Puppy Is Old Enough to Neuter or Spay1," There is some debate about when exactly a puppy should be fixed.Some say when the puppy is two months old is a good time. Others say to wait until the puppy is four to six months old. In general, however, there is an age range when you can begin to think about getting your puppy desexed and that is usually after it has been weaned from its mother but before it reaches sexual maturity.There is some evidence that spaying and neutering can affect the growth of a dog, with an early spay or neuter increasing the dog's growth because it increases the length of time the bones grow. However, waiting until the dog's skeleton has matured would require a very late spay or neuter, which would create other health issues.;
, The estrous cycle in female dogs usually starts when the dog is about six months old, lasts for three to four weeks, and occurs about every six months. Having a female dog spayed before this cycle begins can have positive benefits for the dog's lifelong health.


Spaying a female puppy before her first reproductive cycle will reduce her risk of mammary tumors later in life., Telling the difference between a two month old puppy and a four month old puppy can be difficult. If you have adopted a puppy and you are not sure exactly how old it is, you can look for clues that will give you an approximation. Begin my looking at your puppy's teeth. Assess both the number and type of teeth the puppy has, as well as the condition of its teeth.


If your female puppy is going into heat, meaning that it is having an estrous cycle, then it is old enough to be spayed.

, Every dog is different and that should be taken into consideration when you decide when to get is spayed or neutered. Discuss when your veterinarian thinks it should be done and why that time is ideal.


One variable that may affect when your puppy gets fixed is if it has any medical problems. Dogs that have illnesses or ailments, and thus have compromised immune systems, may need to wait until they are well to get spayed or neutered. Spaying and neutering requires anesthesia and, while very common, is a surgery that should be taken seriously."

Do research about the breed of dog you are thinking of adopting.,
Talk to people whom own the breed of dog you are interested in.,
Find rescues in your area.,
Research the organizations you are interested in.,
Find a dog you are interested in adopting.,
Apply to adopt a dog.,
Be patient.,
Meet your potential dog.,
Adopt the dog.,
Remember to be very patient with your rescue dog.",How to Adopt a Dog from a Breed Rescue," This is easily accomplished by reading about the breed in books that your find at your local library or on dog breed related websites. Do a web search for the breeds you are considering and read all the information you can find that comes from good sources.


If you have no idea what breed you want, you will need to do a little preliminary work to narrow down your choices. Go to websites devoted to describing dog breeds and pick some that you think would be compatible with your lifestyle and your living conditions.;
, Ask questions and think about the answers you want to hear in relation to your lifestyle, income, and physical activity level.For example, a high energy dog probably won't like living with a ""couch potato"" human. If you love to spend your days on the couch and your friend tells you that the dog breed you are considering has tons of energy, then you should probably consider a different breed.

, A breed-specific rescue is usually a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization which fosters rescued dogs in the member's own homes. The dogs are accepted from shelters, turned in by owners, or found as strays.Once you decide what type of dog you want, you will need to find one of these rescue organizations in your area that specializes in rescuing that type of dog.


Do a web search for the words ""dog rescue,"" your city or state, and the breed you are looking for. You can also look at the websites of national dog organizations for lists of breed-specific rescues in your area.If there are several breed-specific rescues you are interested in then you will simply have more dogs to choose from.
Breed-specific rescues are usually smaller than other rescue organization and they only take on dog's with specific breed characteristics., Once you identify the organizations in your area that rescue the breed that you want to adopt, look through the organization's website to understand what they do and what their policies are. If you think that the organization seems good after looking over all of their information, you should contact them.Many rescue organizations do temperament testing, necessary vet care, neutering, and training on their rescues before they are put up for adoption.
Most rescues charge a fee to adopt their dogs to defray the costs involved and to ensure a commitment from the adopting family. Although the prices may seem high, most rescues do not even financially break even on this process.

, Look at all of the dogs listed on the rescue sites and find any that seem like a good fit for you and your family. If there are several that you think might be great, make a list of them so that you will remember them.


If you have several options for dogs, you will need to decide which one suits you best. Make a pros and cons list, figure out what dog is the most in need, or just pick whatever one you are most drawn to. That is the dog that you will apply to adopt first.
If you don't find a dog you are interested in right away, keep checking back on the organization's websites. Most get new dogs regularly, so your new dog may pop up online at another point in time., Once you find the listing for a dog you are interested in you will need to apply to adopt it. Rescue organizations normally have an application process that includes an extensive application form, as well as checking references, including your current veterinarian. They are interested in finding the best home they can for the dogs that they are fostering.Applying to adopt the dog is usually done before you meet it so that there is no time wasted on meeting dogs that you will not be allowed to adopt.

, Do not expect to adopt the same day you apply. It may take some time, as the members will try to match a dog with your family and situation. Since most rescues are 100% run by volunteers, when a rescue organization is contacted, it may take a little while for an answer.The volunteers give their own time and money to keep the rescue going. They have lives outside of the organization. Adopters should not expect rescuers to leave their job in the middle of the day to adopt out a dog. Be reasonable.

, Once you are accepted as a potential adopter, you will make an appointment to meet the dog. This could be done at a neutral location, such as a dog park, or at the home that the dog is being fostered in.


Spend some time with the dog and see how you respond to it and how it responds to you. This is your chance to really get a feel for the pup. Assess its personality and if that personality is what you have been looking for.After you meet the dog you will need to decide whether you want to adopt it. You can decide then and there yes or no or you can take some time to decide.

, Expect to sign a legally-binding contract and pay a fee before getting your dog. The fee helps cover the cost of fostering the dog and getting it spayed or neutered before you adopted it.A reputable rescue will always have you sign a contract which specifies your rights and responsibilities to the rescue and the dog.


A rescue will retain the right to remove the dog from you if you do not meet certain standards in regard to general care, feeding, and vet care. Also, they will usually require you to return the dog to the organization if you have to give it up for any reason.
Don't be afraid to ask the volunteers and foster dog's family any questions about the dog or the breed. They will be more than willing to make you familiar with the dog since they are doing this to find the dog a ""forever home"" rather than trying to find you a pet.

, Keep in mind your dog may be nervous and confused. Your dog may have temporary issues with house training or may have received mixed messages from their previous owner — they may react strangely or fearfully to certain commands or when they see objects like newspaper, sticks, shoes, or other objects. Your dog may not have been socialized, either, so they may not know how to walk politely or interact well with other dogs. It is essential that you are calm, patient, and understanding with your dog, especially during the first few weeks. Your dog's true personality may not even emerge until they begin to feel comfortable in their new home.It may take weeks before a rescue dog begins to relax around you and your family. Limit exciting in the first few weeks, such as trips to the dog park, and instead focus on helping your dog feel safe in your home and learning what they like, dislike, and what frightens them.
Any training or behavior issues can be brought to the attention of the shelter or your vet and they can help you connect with a trainer who uses positive reinforcement. Work with the trainer to help teach your dog good habits and that training is not something to be feared.
Some rescue dogs may come with ""baggage."" For instance some dogs will not do well with other dogs, some don't like men, or have other fears, and some are special needs dogs that have medical problems. Recognize this as a possibility, but don't let it stop you from adopting from a rescue organization.

Separate the puppy from littermates.,
Play with the puppy.",How to Know when Puppies Are Ready for New Homes," Early adoption presents many risks for newborn puppies. Perhaps the most important thing to consider when it comes to homing a puppy is that the dog must have the time to go through all of its developmental stages before settling into its forever home. Without enough time, dogs may exhibit behavioral problems.


Veterinarians and breeds typically recommend waiting until week 8 before homing a dog.
Under certain circumstances, a dog might be rehomed between week 7 and week 8.
Separating a dog early may result in the dog developing separation anxiety.
Dogs homed earlier than 8 weeks often exhibit behavior problems including destructiveness, excessive barking, inability to be house trained, or aggression.;
, Smaller dogs are often more fragile than other dogs and may need a longer time to move through developmental stages.


Some dogs that may need a delayed schedule include: chihuahuas, Yorkshire terriers, and pugs.
Breeders will sometimes delay homing of small dogs until 12 weeks., An independent puppy is one that will be able to handle the physical, emotional, and social pressures that come with the homing process. Without a certain level of independence, puppies may develop behavioral issues that stay with them throughout life. Make sure:


The puppy is not emotionally dependent on its mother. This means the puppy has been separated from its mother for a substantial amount of time -- at night and during the day. For instance, the puppy has slept on its own (or with littermates) apart from the mother.
The puppy has had substantial interaction with humans and animals outside of its mother and littermates.
The puppy is physically independent. This means it can eat, walk, and play without constant supervision., In some cases, puppies might need more than 8 weeks before they’re adopted out. Ultimately, you’ll need to evaluate the dog and come to a judgement about their development. Important factors delaying adoption may include:


The mother dog passed away.
The puppy experienced some sort of trauma or medical problem such as an injury sustained by another dog or a sickness or illness.
The dog has exhibited some sort of developmental issue or has been delayed in weaning, potty training, crate training, or other milestones.
Always base the timeline of homing a puppy on the individual dog – if it needs more time, provide it. If you rush the homing process, the dog may develop behavioral problems.,, Weaning is the process in which a person transitions a puppy from their mother’s milk to solid food. Ultimately, the weaning process is one of the most important stages of a puppy’s development.


Weaning usually occurs between week 3 and 5.
This process takes from days to several weeks.
Start weaning by providing milk replacer for one meal a day. After you’ve experienced success, provide the puppy with soft food.
A puppy must be weaned before being adopted out., Potty training is the process in which you teach a new puppy to only go to the bathroom in a certain location. Since most puppies will be house pets, potty training is an essential thing to work on before adopting a puppy out.


Put the puppy on an outside schedule. Puppies between 4 and 6 weeks should be allowed to go outside every 2 to 4 hours. Six month old pups may need 6 hours between outside time.
Use puppy pee pads or training paper to demarcate areas where puppies may go to the bathroom.
Crate training reinforces potty training, as dogs don’t want to mess in the area they sleep. If you find a puppy doing so, you need to take them outside more often.
Don’t yell at a puppy because they messed inside or in their crate. It may take weeks to potty train them., Crate training is the process in which a new puppy – and their littermates – are introduced and acclimated to crates. This is important, as dogs may wind up staying in their crates substantial amounts of time after they are homed.


Crate training is typically done between 5 and 7 weeks. At first puppies will spend time with their mother and littermates in a crate, and will later be introduced to a crate on their own.
Dogs naturally come to view their crates as safe havens or as their “dens.”, A puppy’s first booster shots are important because they provide valuable immunity to common illnesses. Without their first booster shots, puppies are vulnerable to a wide variety of life-threatening conditions.


Puppy shots include distemper, measles, parainfluenza, and bordetella.
Many breeders and vets recommend the first set of puppy shots around 6 to 8 weeks after birth.
Puppy shots should be administered several days before a puppy is homed., This is a key development stage for any puppy. During this process, puppies will learn important behaviors and traits that will influence the way they act for their entire lives.


The socialization period for a puppy begins around 3 weeks and extends through at least the 6th week.
Puppies should be allowed to fight, play, and engage in other activities with their littermates.
Puppies will learn a variety of things, including dominance, submission, and communication skills., Separating the puppy from its littermates for part of the day (and during bedtime) is an important first step in the socialization process. This is because it allows the puppy more time to be socialized with humans, rather than just dogs.


This usually happens between 6 and 8 weeks.
Provide the puppy with a separate crate of its own.
Mixing with its littermates is okay during this period, just make sure that the puppy is crated and sleeps by itself.
After separation, puppies will need a lot more individualized care., After separation, the puppy needs intense human socialization. During this point, you need to make sure that the puppy is allowed to be around humans for a majority of the day. Without human socialization, the puppy will have a much harder time adjusting to its new home.

Provide the puppy with at least some one-on-one time.
Make sure to play and interact with the puppy for a couple hours every day. Allow it to follow you around.
The socialization process will continue at the puppy’s new home."

Consider the benefits to your puppy.Spaying or neutering your dog can help the dog's health over the course of its lifetime.,
Consider the benefits to your household.,
Consider the benefits to society.",How to Know if a Puppy Is Old Enough to Neuter or Spay2," In addition to avoiding unintended reproduction, spaying and neutering can reduce the risk of a variety of cancers and infections.


Spaying reduces the risk of uterine cancer, uterine infections, and reduces the tendency to fight with other animals.Neutering can reduce a male dog's chance of getting testicular tumors and prostate inflammation.

, Having a pet that has an accidental pregnancy, or a pet that accidentally impregnates another animal, can complicate your and your families lives. Additionally, the positive impacts to your dog's health and personality that often go along with spaying and neutering not only affect your dog, but your family as well.


Deciding what to do with additional, unexpected pets can be a serious issue. Finding homes for more puppies can be easily avoided with a prompt spay or neuter at a young age.
Neutering your male dog also reduces the likelihood of it marking its territory, including your home, with its urine.In general, neutered dogs are also less aggressive due to a lack of sexual competitiveness and the chance of inappropriate ""humping"" will also be reduced., While you may have reservations about getting your puppy spayed or neutered, it is in the interest of your community and your society that you do. There are thousands of homeless and neglected pets out there that need homes, and adding to the pet population with an unintended pregnancy only exacerbates that problem.There are numerous homeless pets that live on the streets or in shelters and pounds that are desperate need of a good home. If you are considering keeping your puppy's sexual organs intact, think about all the dogs out there that don't have a loving and caring home. If your dog has puppies, they will take homes that could go to dogs that are in need.

Monitor puppies closely.",How to Keep Newborn Puppies Warm and Clean," When picking a place to keep your puppies, choose a warm area of your home. The area should be away from drafts and vents for optimal warmth. If you're keeping the puppies outdoors, store them in an area away from the elements like a shed or the garage., Insulation is important for adequate warmth, especially if you're keeping your puppies outdoors. Make sure to properly insulate any shelter you use so your puppies stay warm.Lay several sheets of newspaper at the bottom of the box. In addition to preserving warmth, these will help collect droppings and other messes.
You should also lie plenty of fresh, clean towels and blankets at the bottom of the crate.

, You should invest in a thermometer in the room or area where your puppies are kept. The temperature should always be between 85 and 90°F (29.5 and 32°C) for the first four days. After this, the temperature can be reduced to 80°F (26.7°C). Indoors, a heating lamp can be used to achieve this temperature. You do not need to keep the entire room at these temperatures.Outdoor heating is important if you're keeping your dogs inside. Heating pads, heating lamps, space heaters, and water bottles can all be used for outdoor heating., It's important the sides of the shelter are low enough that the mother can hop in and out as necessary. You want the shelter to be clean, so the mother should be able to leave to urinate and defecate., Puppies will make messes in their shelter, so regular cleaning is important. Each day, replace the newspaper, blankets, and towels. Wash blankets and towels completely before returning them to the shelter., For the most part, the mother will take care of cleaning newborn puppies. However, if the mother rejects the litter, that task is left to you. It's important that you keep newborn puppies clean to prevent infections and other complications.Use a warm and wet washcloth to clean the puppies. Use gentle wiping motions to clean your puppies.
Clean the puppies around their faces. You should also clean around the anal area after they eat, as this will encourage them to eliminate.

, When cleaning a puppy's cage, take this as an opportunity to check the stools. Healthy stools are a sign your puppies are developing safely. In general, stools should be brown and firm. Loose or discolored stools should be evaluated by a doctor., As puppies get older, have different areas of the cage for eating, sleeping, and eliminating. This will help the puppies stay clean on their own.Use a low board to separate the sleeping and eating area from the bathroom area. Lay down newspaper or cedar pines to encourage the puppies to eliminate here.
Move stools to the bathroom area to encourage the puppies to eliminate here.

, If you notice anything abnormal while cleaning, such as discolored or bloody stools, consult a veterinarian. You should also consult a vet if puppies seem cold or shivery despite your efforts to keep them warm.If you need to keep your puppies warm because their mother has rejected them, talk to a vet about this as well. A vet can give you advice on how to best keep orphaned or rejected litters warm and safe.

, When cleaning out the crate or box, make sure all puppies are accounted for. Puppies can sometimes slip under towels or blankets and they can get injured if you accidentally disturb them while cleaning., You want to make sure your puppies are developing at a normal rate. Keep an eye on the puppies to make sure they're showing normal signs of development.During the first two weeks of life, it's normal for puppies to sleep for about 90% of the time. Their eyes will be closed during this time. As they get older, their eyes will open and they will become more active.
Weigh your puppies regularly. Puppies should continue to gain weight over time. If your puppies are losing weight, consult your vet.

Make sure you have adequate funds to adopt a dog overseas.,
Seek out international adoption agencies.,
Consider your lifestyle.,
Visit the dog first if possible.",How to Adopt a Dog from Overseas1," Adopting a dog overseas is not cheap. In addition to an adoption fee, there are costs like travel, veterinarian exams, and fines and fees for transporting a dog in or out of the country. On average, it can cost anywhere between $150 and $2,000 to adopt a dog overseas. Make sure you can get this money together before committing to the adoption process., You may find a dog you want to adopt while traveling overseas. For example, you may find a stray you want to take in or meet a dog at a local shelter. However, if you simply want to adopt a dog in need from another country, you will have to find an agency to work with that will help you find a dog that works for you.Try seeing if there is a branch of the Humane Society operating in the country where you're thinking of adopting a dog. You can also look into Humane Society International, which can help pair you with dogs in need from a variety of countries.
There are also organizations that can help with cost of transportation, if that's an issue. The nonprofit Pilots N' Paws, for example, works with pilots and other airline officials to help with transportation costs.

, If you're thinking of adopting a dog, whether from overseas or locally, you should always consider your lifestyle first. Do you truly have time for the responsibility? If you're going to put the time and money into adopting a dog overseas, make sure you are up for the task first.Do you have the time and money to dedicate to a dog? Can you provide a rescue dog with the time and attention it will need? Rescue dogs may have special needs, and if you're transporting a dog from another country the transition may be rough. Be honest with yourself as to whether you have the extra time necessary to care for a rescue dog.
If you already found a dog to adopt, think about whether that dog's personality matches with your lifestyle. A very energetic dog, for example, may not work great for you if you tend to stay in a lot and live in a small building. However, if the dog in question is more of a couch potato, it may be a good match for you.

, The best way to tell if a rescue dog works for you is to visit in person. Interacting with the dog will help you tell whether you and the dog are able to bond. If a trip to the country where you're adopting is possible, make this trip first. It's always better to meet a dog in person before committing to an adoption.If you can't meet the dog in person, read as much about it as you can prior to adopting. The more information you have, the more likely you will be to find a dog that matches your lifestyle.

Remove the amniotic membrane.,
Snip the umbilical cord.,
Clear away mucus.,
Avoid using water.",How to Keep Orphaned Newborn Puppies Clean1," In the event of the mother dog’s death or absence, she will not be able to perform several crucial actions at the time of delivery. This first of these is to remove the amniotic membrane, or the clear sac that the puppies are born in. It is necessary to remove this immediately in order for the pups to breathe. Simply break this membrane with your fingers, and slide the puppies out.Be certain that your hands are clean before touching the newborn puppies.;
, Next, you will need to remove the umbilical cord. Normally, a mother dog would bite this. Use a pair of sharp scissors to snip this cord, leaving approximately ½ an inch of cord on the puppy. Then use a piece of thread or string to tie this off., Mucus must be cleared away from each puppy’s mouth, nose, and throat. This can be done with a rubber bulb syringe (the same kind you would use for a human baby). Simply depress the bulb syringe, place it close to the area you want to cleanse, and then release the depression. This should suck the mucus out. Cleanse the bulb syringe after each puppy, or as needed.To clean the throat, wrap your non-dominant arm around the puppy, and use that hand to hold their mouth open. Then, holding the bulb syringe in your dominant hand, place it as close to the back of the throat as you can. Depress the bulb, and suck out the mucus.

, Although the puppies will be bit a sticky, do not place them in water or bathe them. It is extremely crucial for the puppies to stay warm, and this will be especially difficult without their mother. You can wipe them down with a warm towel, and then place them near a heating pad to stay warm."

Choose a potty place.,
Choose a cue word to train your Pomeranian to go potty.,
Show your Pomeranian where to go potty.",How to House Train a Pomeranian Puppy1," Before bringing your Pomeranian home, decide on the place where you want your Pomeranian to toilet. Make sure that you choose a place that is convenient for you and your Pomeranian to get to. Your dog will need to be taken to the potty spot regularly in order to reinforce good habits. The options are a patch in the yard, or puppy pads by a door, or a litter box. If you are often gone for long periods of time (more than eight hours), puppy pads or a litter box will be necessary.The patch in the yard should be a place where you don't have special or prized plants, because you want to encourage the dog to pee and poo here.

Puppy pads are like a flat diaper, and they are made from the same absorbent material. Your dog can pee or poop on them and then you throw them away.

Litter boxes also work for Pomeranians. Choose a tray with low sides so the pup can hop in without problems, and put some absorbent cat litter in the tray. Scoop out the solids and soiled areas once a day, and clean the whole tray with pet disinfectant once a week.;
, Before you start training your Pomeranian to go potty where you want him to, decide on the cue word you are going to use each time your Pomeranian goes potty. This builds an association in the dog's mind between the word and toileting, so that eventually he may even go on demand.Use a single word, such as “potty” or “business.”

, Take your Pomeranian to the spot that you want him to go potty when you are house training him.Don't let him have the range of the house or he might squat and go to the toilet where he pleases. This scent marks the house which means he returns to those same spots and you have an uphill task house training him.


If you are training your Pomeranian to go potty indoors, try placing the puppy pads or litter box in a spot where your dog has already gone to the bathroom several times. This might make it easier to get him to use the pads or litter box.
You may need to take your Pomeranian outside or to the puppy pad or litter box several times before he gets the idea. Be patient and gentle as you do this.

You can usually find the information online through a website associated with your government. Organizations like the Centers for Disease Control provide information on overseas adoption for many different countries.

, Most countries require a health certificate at the airport. When your dog travels through customs, a veterinarian or customs worker will need to view this certificate to assure your dog is healthy and will not bring any contagious diseases into your country.Locate a reputable local vet to perform a basic exam on your dog. Have them fill out any required paperwork assuring your dog's health.
If you're working with an adoption agency, they may have their own vet that provides exams and health certificates.
Always check requirements in your own country in regards to paperwork. Some countries may not require a veterinary exam, or may require more than one exam before a dog may enter the country.

, Rabies is still a problem in the United States. While rabies has been more or less eradicated in countries like Australia, there are still cases of rabies in the US each year. When bringing a dog into the United States, you are required to get your dog a rabies vaccination.If your dog has never been vaccinated before, it needs to be vaccinated at least 30 days before arriving in the United States.

Puppies cannot be vaccinated until they're at least three months old. Therefore, a puppy will have to be at least four months old before it can enter the United States. If you're trying to adopt a puppy younger than this, you may need to wait before officially completing the adoption.

, Screwworm is a parasite that is an issue in certain countries. If you're bringing a dog into the United States from a country where screwworm is an issue, you will need a certification stating your dog is screwworm free.Screwworm is present in countries such as Kenya, Iraq, Jamaica, Peru, and Nigeria. You can find a full list of countries where screwworm is an issue on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.You need to have a certificate filled out by a full-time salaried veterinarian stating your dog has been inspected for screwworm and is screwworm free. This certificate should be filled out at least 5 days before your dog has been shipped to the United States.

, Microchips are small chips embedded into your dog's skin that provide identification in the event your dog gets lost. Not all countries require microchips. For EU countries, however, a microchip is required for all dogs entering the country.Your dog will need to be microchipped before you travel into an EU country. You will also need documentation verifying your dog has been microchipped.

Contact your state animal health officials once you get home.",How to Adopt a Dog from Overseas3," If you're taking a dog back with you from vacation, or bringing a dog back after visiting, talk to your airline. Make sure you're allowed to bring your dog on the plane and figure out the cost and requirements for air travel with a dog.Airlines often charge extra for you to bring a dog with you. It can cost anywhere between $200 and $2,000 to transport a dog from overseas.
If cost is an issue, reach out to a charity organization like Pilots N' Paws to see if they can help with some of the cost. If you're already working with an adoption agency, they may be able to have the dog transported for you at a reduced rate.

, If it's not possible to have a dog on an airplane with you, you may be able to check the dog as baggage or unaccompanied cargo. The dog would still be on the plane, but not in the cabin with you. Explore these options if your airline does not allow dogs on the plane., The majority of countries will have some form of airport inspection. This is usually conducted by a veterinarian at the airport. The purpose is to make sure your dog is disease free before it enters your country.You may also have to present paperwork, such as a proof of rabies vaccination, at this point. Make sure you have your paperwork ready to go when you meet with an airport veterinarian.
You want to make sure you enter the country when the airport vet is ready to conduct an inspection. Some airports may not have vets on staff all the time, so getting your dog past customs may require some waiting.

, Local regulations for overseas pets vary, even within the same country. Once you and your dog get home, contact state animal health officials. They can help you complete any remaining paperwork to finalize the adoption process."

Manually stimulate each puppy.,
Wipe away any mess.,
Repeat this before and after each feeding.,
Continue this for around 21 days.",How to Keep Orphaned Newborn Puppies Clean2," Newborn puppies are unable to urinate or have bowel movements on their own. Normally, the mother dog’s grooming and licking of the anal area activates this. With orphaned puppies, you must stimulate them. Simply moisten a cotton ball with warm water, and gently rub the genital area for 1-2 minutes.Puppies should urinate/defecate on the cotton ball.

, If the puppy does urinate or defecate, most of it should be absorbed by the cotton ball. However, you should keep some paper towels nearby to clean up any additional mess., Some puppies will respond best to this prior to feeding, and others will do better after feeding. In order to ensure that all puppies are going potty, you should repeat this procedure before and after each feeding.Newborn puppies will need to eat around every 2 hours.

, It usually takes about three weeks for puppies to be able to urinate and defecate on their own. Keep stimulating them for around 21 days."

Develop a good daily routine.,
Encourage your Pomeranian to use the same spot every time.,
Monitor your Pomeranian while house training him.,
Stop your Pomeranian from eliminating where he should not.,
Clean up messes as soon as they happen.,
Praise your Pomeranian when he goes potty where you want him to go.",How to House Train a Pomeranian Puppy2," Having a solid daily routine may help your Pomeranian learn where and when to go potty. Make sure that you feed your Pomeranian and take him outside (or to his puppy pad or litter box) frequently — remember that puppies have tiny bladders and will need to go outside often. For instance, an eight- to 12-week-old puppy should be taken to the toileting spot every 30 minutes.If the puppy toilets, reward him and then give him another chance in 30 minutes. If he does not toilet, keep a very close eye on him. As soon as he shows signs of sniffing for a place to do his business, pop him onto the toileting spot.

, Taking your dog to the same spot every time you want him to go potty may help you to housebreak him as well. Use your cue word, such as “potty,” to let your Pomeranian know what you want him to do when you get to that spot. The repetition of going to the same place and hearing the same words will help your Pomeranian understand what you want from him.Remember to offer your dog lots of praise after he goes to the bathroom outside or on his puppy pad or in his litter box.

, Watching your dog for signs that he might be about to urinate or defecate in the house can help you to house train him. If your Pomeranian is prone to eliminating in places you don’t want him to, find a way to keep him in your sight at all times. Monitoring your dog’s whereabouts will help you to train him to go potty where you want him to go.


Try keeping your Pomeranian on a six foot long leash that is attached to you. This will prevent him from going off to another room to eliminate and it will also help you to observe his behavior and determine when he needs to go.If you cannot keep an eye on your Pomeranian during the day, you can use a crate or baby gate to confine your Pomeranian to a small area for short periods of time (less than four hours)., As soon as you notice that your Pomeranian is getting ready to urinate or defecate somewhere that is off limits, get his attention by clapping your hands together loudly. Do not yell at your dog or use physical punishment to change his behavior. Just clap your hands to get his attention and then lead or carry him to his potty spot (outside, puppy pad, or litter box) right away.


Be kind and encouraging to your Pomeranian as you lead him to his potty spot. If you yell or act like you are angry with him, he may begin to associate going potty with punishment., The smell of a prior mess can prompt your Pomeranian to want to eliminate in the same place again. The best way to prevent your Pomeranian from soiling an area again is to clean up his messes right away by using an enzymatic cleaner made especially for cleaning up pet messes.Don’t yell or punish your Pomeranian for going potty where he is not supposed to go. It will not do anything to discourage him and it may even lead to more problems by increasing his fear and anxiety., Positive reinforcement is the best way to teach your Pomeranian a new behavior. Make sure that you reward your dog with lots of praise after he urinates or defecates in his potty spot. You can also reward your dog by giving him treats, some playtime, or a walk.Give the praise, treat, or other reward right after he goes potty where you want him to go. This will help your Pomeranian understand that he has done something good.

If your veterinarian has identified a medical condition that requires special treatment, medication, or other interventions, make sure that you follow the veterinarian’s instructions.If your Pomeranian’s elimination problems are related to a medical condition, they will not improve until he is cured. Contact your veterinarian immediately if your Pomeranian’s condition worsens or does not improve despite treatment.

, Some dogs just don’t like to go outside when the weather is bad. You can help make the experience more tolerable for your dog by getting cold and/or wet weather gear for your dog. For example, if your dog does not like the feel of his paws in the snow, consider getting some boots for your dog to wear when you take him outside. Or, if your dog doesn’t like to get wet, consider getting him a raincoat to wear when it is raining., To make sure that your dog does not have to hold it for long periods of time, ask a friend or neighbor to come by and take your Pomeranian out or encourage him to use his puppy pad or litter box. If you are training your Pomeranian to go potty outside, forcing him to stay in the house for several hours will lead to messes because he will not be able to hold it for that long.Even if you are training your Pomeranian to use a puppy pad or litter box, he may need some guidance and encouragement to do so.


If you don’t know anyone who is willing or able to take your Pomeranian out for you during long periods away, consider hiring a pet sitter to stop by when you have a long day away from home.

, If your dog does not respond to your house training efforts and there is no medical reason for your dog’s issues, you may want to consider hiring a certified professional dog trainer to help you house train your Pomeranian."

Rub peanut butter on chew toys.,
Give your puppy an ice-cold rag.,
Avoid thin plastic or rawhide.",How to Help Teething Pups1," Chew toys help satisfy the puppy’s urges. When new teeth are putting pressure on a puppy's gums, chewing is a natural reaction.

The best chew toys are made of sturdy materials. Toys made out of hard nylon, thick plastic, or durable rope are best.Good toys include KONG toys, chewing ropes, interactive puzzle toys, hard plastic bones, and teething sticks.
Choose a toy that is appropriate for your dog’s size. A small breed may not be able to chew a large toy while a large breed may choke on a small toy.;
, If your puppy is hesitant to chew their toys instead of your furniture, you can put a little peanut butter on the toy. A small spoonful is enough. Do not put too much on the toy, or it may keep your dog from eating more nutritious food.

, Freeze a clean dishrag after dipping it in water and wringing it out. Twist the damp dishrag into a tight, rope-like shape and let it freeze that way.

Every day, walk the puppy for about five minutes for every month of age. For example, a three month old puppy will go out for fifteen minutes while a four month old puppy will go out for twenty.Use a puppy harness and leash to walk the puppy to prevent injuries. You may have better luck if you let the puppy get used to the harness first. Place the harness on the puppy twenty minutes before the walk, and let them wander around their home with it on.;

, Puppies cannot hold their bladders as long as older dogs. You will need to keep a regular schedule to take the puppy outside to eliminate. You might take the puppy on a short walk, or you can just let them run out to relieve themselves. Write your puppy breaks into your schedule so that you remember to take them out., If your puppy has separation anxiety, leaving a TV or radio on can make them think that someone is nearby.

Play it cool.,
Keep them occupied with chew toys.,
Avoid punishing bad behavior.,
Consult an expert.",How to Help Puppies Learn Separation Skills1," When training puppies, it is best to approach them individually to keep them from distracting each other. At around 7-9 weeks, puppies start to learn how to be part of a human home and must bond with their owners to do that. Too much time spent with a sibling or other pet will run the risk of making its relationship with you secondary, or less important, making training very difficult., Much of a puppy's separation anxiety comes from a need for direction. Once puppies are about 12-16 weeks old, try teaching them basic commands by means of correction and reward. To start, this training should only last for 10-15 minutes a session, and it should be an enjoyable and bonding experience.


You can also visit the American Kennel Club website at http://www.akc.org/content/dog-training/articles/teach-your-puppy-these-5-basic-commands/ for instructions on how to teach your puppies the five basic commands: ""Sit,” ""Stay,"" ""Lay down,” ""Heel,” and ""Come here.""

, Condition your puppies out of the anxiety they experience when you leave the house by way of treats. Every time you are on your way out, give your puppies (one-on-one) a ""high value treat"" - i.e. something that each puppy loves and only gets on special occasions. Over time, your puppies will associate you leaving with reward, as opposed to stress., Dogs are very in tune with human emotions and tend to reflect them back in their behavior (e.g. a dog getting overexcited around a boisterous group of people). Puppies with separation anxiety will be even more sensitive to the emotional influence of their owners or people around them. When leaving your puppy (by exiting a room or going out of the house for a while), and when you return, stay calm and avoid exuding excessive excitement., Leave puppies with puzzle and chew toys when you're away to keep them occupied. Teething puppies love to chew, and an assortment of five to ten chew toys will keep them physically and mentally engaged in your absence. Choose digestible chew toys (e.g. Puppystix) or hollowed out toys that you can put food in the middle of (puppies will have to work hard at chewing to get the food out of the toy).Visit a pet store to choose from a variety of chew toy options.

, If puppies misbehave while you are away, punishing them afterwards will have no effect. Dogs live in the moment, and puppies in particular will not make the connection between a punishment (e.g. scolding) and something they did earlier. Stay calm, and be sure to avoid leaving your puppy alone until you are sure it will not misbehave again.For instance, if you come home and see that your puppy has chewed a shoe, stay relaxed, remove the shoe, and avoid leaving it alone with access to your shoe rack again.

, If separation anxiety persists and your puppy continues to exhibit bad behavior, consult an expert for help. Visit your vet to see if there might be any medical reasons behind the problems. If there are no health related issues affecting your puppy, your vet may be able to recommend a Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT) to help train your puppy and resolve issues tied to separation anxiety."

Purchase crates.,
Make the crates comfortable.,
Try closing the door.,
Go out.,
Crate your puppies overnight.",How to Help Puppies Learn Separation Skills2," Crate training is a method that works with the natural denning instinct of dogs to adjust problem behavior, though it should not be used as a punishment. Your puppies' crates should become their individual refuges, and help them curb their separation anxiety. Purchase crates that will accommodate puppies when they grow to adult size. Visit the Association of Professional Dog Trainers website at https://apdt.com/pet-owners/crate-size/ to see a list of dog breeds and the right sizes of crate for them.While dogs are still puppies, separate the crate with dividers so that they aren't too big for them.

, Line the crates with soft blankets and throw in some toys to make them inviting. Leave crate doors open so the puppies can explore them, and put sleepy puppies in crates to nap to build comfortable associations with them. Start feeding your puppies inside the crate (both treats and meals) to get them used to the idea of being inside, but leave the doors open., With each puppy, start closing the crate door with the puppy inside of it for a few seconds at a time during meal time. Stay close to the crate until your puppy seems okay with being inside with the door closed and doesn’t whine to be let out. Leave the room for a few minutes while your puppy is inside, then give it praise and treats as a reward once you come back to let it out.Leave the room for longer periods of time once your puppy starts to seem more comfortable.

, Once puppies seem okay with being left in their crates for up to 30 minutes, try leaving the house with them crated. Puppies can have anxiety about being unsupervised in a big space, so crating your puppies while you are out can keep them calm and behaved. Lead puppies into crates about 15-20 minutes before you leave to prevent associations between crate time and you going out without them. Keep your departure and arrival calm and quiet to avoid getting the puppies riled up.Keep crating regularly. Puppies should be crated while you are home as well, but in short periods. Avoid leaving puppies younger than 6 months old in their crate for more than 3-4 hours at a time - they need to relieve themselves more often than older dogs.

, Once they're over 6 months old, try crating your puppies overnight. At first, keep the crates in your bedroom, so that you can let your puppies out for bathroom breaks if necessary during the night. When the puppies get more comfortable with sleeping in crates, try moving them out of your room..To get puppies used to being alone, try moving the crates into separate rooms.

It’s best not to give puppies extra space because they’re liable to do their business in one corner of the crate instead of asking to go outside.Crates often range in size from 18"" x 12"" x 14"" for small breeds all the way up to 48"" x 30"" x 33"" for large or giant breeds. For maximum convenience, get a crate that’s the right size for your full-grown dog and insert a temporary physical divider into it to create a smaller space for your puppy. Move the divider back as your puppy grows.
Both crates and dividers are available at most pet stores.;
, Before you train your puppy to sleep in their crate, it’s important to familiarize them with it and establish it as a positive place. Introduce your young pet to their new crate by putting it in a social space, like your living room, with the door open. Drop treats and/or toys into the crate to encourage your dog to explore inside it.You want your puppy to think that going inside the crate is their idea, so don’t force them in it. Let them explore it at their own pace while you praise them in a happy voice.

, The fastest way to get your dog used to their crate is to relocate their meals to inside of it. Feeding them in their crate helps establish it as a safe, happy place.If your puppy is wary of going into the crate at first, start by feeding them just outside the crate. Then, put their dish right by the door so that they’re eating with their head inside the crate. Keep moving the food bowl further and further back with each mealtime until their entire body is inside.
Once your dog is comfortable feeding in the crate, close the door while they eat and let them out immediately afterwards.
Then, gradually extend the time they are in the crate with the door closed after eating from a few minutes to a quarter of an hour. This will help them become comfortable with being confined in their crate.

, Playing crate games teaches your puppy to stay in their crate while associating staying in it with positive rewards. Start by leading your pet inside their crate and closing the door without latching it. Have a handful of treats in one hand and hold the door with the other.Now, open the door with one hand while feeding your dog treats through the side of the crate with the other. If they stay in their crate, they get the treats. If they try to run out, quickly close the door before they can and start again.
Once they have this routine down, it’s a good thing to do each morning when you’re letting them out of the crate since it rewards them for staying in the crate during the night and teaches them to wait for your command to leave the crate.
Playing this crate game will give your dog positive associations with their crate.
It will also teach your pup that they have choices. Their good behavior and decisions will result in a reward while their bad behavior and decisions will lead to restrictions.

, If you want your puppy to sleep well in their own bed, you need them to associate their crate with rewards and relaxation. Confining them to their crate as a disciplinary measure will only reinforce their fear and suspicion of it.Since young puppies cannot control their bladder yet, you should not leave the puppy in the crate for more than three or four hours at a time., Since your puppy is bound to feel a lot of separation anxiety at first, it’s a good idea to put their latched crate inside your bedroom or just outside the door for the first few nights.It’s tempting to put them far away from you where you won’t hear their whining, but this will only make the transition harder for your puppy. They’re far more likely to settle down if they’re somewhere where they can see you.
You can gradually move your puppy’s crate further away if you prefer them to sleep elsewhere in the house. However, it’s a good idea to keep your puppy within earshot until you know that they can make it through the night without having to go to the bathroom.

, It’s very likely that your puppy will whine when you first close the door of their crate. They might continue for a long time while you try to go to sleep. Even though they’re impossible to tune out, it’s important that you do not respond to their cries.If you respond to their cries, you are teaching them that whining behavior will get them what they want. This can lead to serious issues down the road, not just with their sleeping.
Do not punish your puppy for whining. If you scold your puppy, you are still teaching them that whining will get a response from you. You do not want to give them any response.
Puppies learn from consistency. Resist any urges to “make exceptions” for one night. Wear ear plugs, close the door, or turn on white noise to help you ignore the puppy.

, No dog likes to pee where they sleep, and puppies have very small bladders. If your puppy starts suddenly whining in the middle of the night, they likely have to be let out for a bathroom break.Take your puppy out for a 3-4 minute walk and then put them back in their crate and close the door.
Puppies are generally not able to “hold it” through a full night until they reach four or more months of age.

, Your pet is much more likely to fall asleep without complaint if they have had sufficient exercise during the day. Taking them out for a good evening walk will help them settle down later.Avoid, however, revving your puppy up with energetic play (like fetch or tug) immediately before bed. Give them a half hour to wind down before you bring them to their crate.

, Puppies need to go to the bathroom a lot, so it’s important to be sure that they’ve urinated and defecated before you tuck them in at night.Keep in mind that puppies are easily distracted when you take them outdoors and may well forget to do their business. Accompany them to be sure that they have before you let them back in.

, This could be a dog bed or a pad, a blanket or old comforter. Just be sure that it’s comfortable and appropriate bedding for the weather.For instance, it’s probably not a good idea to drown your puppy in wooly fleece if it’s in the middle of the summer.

, Sometimes putting a hot water bottle in their crate can be a comfort to young pups. Besides keeping them warm, it approximates the feel of having another body to sleep next to.Be sure that the hot water bottle has a cloth covering so that it’s not directly against their skin.
Water bottles will need to be sturdy. The puppy should not be able to bite through the water bottle or tear it apart.

, Doing so will help your puppy feel secure and give them positive associations with their bed. It also gives them something to do besides whine if they can’t get to sleep or are up earlier than you.If your puppy is teething, be sure to put a chew toy in their crate. Playing with a chew toy can be a wonderful calming activity if your puppy is feeling anxious about sleeping alone.

This infection can quickly become very serious. When you notice symptoms of aspiration pneumonia, such as milk running out of your puppy’s nose, schedule an appointment with your vet as soon as possible.Look for other symptoms as well:open mouth breathing
noisy, wet breathing
blue gums (normal gums are pink)
weakness
panting;
, Your vet will examine your puppy and run different tests to confirm an aspiration pneumonia diagnosis. During the physical exam, your vet will listen very closely to your puppy’s lungs to detect abnormal lung sounds. The diagnostic tests your vet may perform include:chest x-rays
blood work
pulse oximetry, which measures the amount of oxygen in the blood

, If your puppy’s aspiration pneumonia is severe, your puppy may need to be hospitalized so your vet can start immediate supportive therapy. Supportive therapy will not cure the pneumonia, but will help your puppy feel better and get stronger. Examples of supportive therapy include:Oxygen therapy to raise low blood oxygen levels
Medication to make breathing easier (‘bronchodilators’)
Intravenous fluids to rehydrate your puppy
Anti-vomiting medication

, Antibiotics will be needed to treat the bacterial infection caused by the aspiration pneumonia.If your vet obtained a fluid sample from your puppy’s lungs, they will prescribe an antibiotic to target the specific type of bacteria in the lungs.


If obtaining a fluid sample wasn’t possible, your vet will probably prescribe a broad-spectrum antibiotic, which will target a wide range of disease-causing bacteria., The bacterial infection in your puppy’s lungs may take a long time to clear up. When your puppy is strong enough to go home, your vet may prescribe a few weeks’ worth of antibiotics.To ensure all the bacteria are killed, give your puppy the full course of antibiotics, without missing a dose.


Do not stop antibiotic treatment if your puppy starts looking and feeling better. If you stop the treatment early, all the bacteria may not be killed. The surviving bacteria could multiply and become resistant to other antibiotics.

, Your vet will probably want to see your puppy regularly during its antibiotic treatment to make sure the aspiration pneumonia is getting better. During these rechecks, your vet will take chest x-rays to look at your puppy’s lungs., If your young puppy has megaesophagus, it can frequently regurgitate its food. By accident, it can breathe this food into its lungs, causing aspiration pneumonia. After aspiration pneumonia treatment at your vet’s office, care for your puppy at home by properly managing its megaesophagus:Have your puppy eat and drink in an upright position.
Keep your puppy upright for 20–30 minutes after it finishes eating and drinking.
Add water to your puppy’s dry food to help it go down the esophagus more easily.
Give medications as prescribed by your vet.

, Improper tube feeding, by overfeeding or putting the tube down the trachea instead of the esophagus, can lead to aspiration pneumonia in young puppies.If you tube feed your puppy, doing it correctly can prevent another bout of aspiration pneumonia:Make sure no air bubbles are in the milk formula.
Before inserting the feeding tube, measure it from your puppy’s mouth to its last rib. Place your puppy on its side to do the measuring.
Slowly thread the tube over the puppy’s tongue and down the throat.
Run your thumb and index finger along your puppy’s neck to make sure you can feel the trachea and the feeding tube.
Do not hold your puppy by its abdomen after the tube feeding.

, When giving oral liquid medications to a puppy using a syringe, it can be easy for that medication to end up in the puppy’s lungs, causing aspiration pneumonia.To prevent aspiration pneumonia when giving liquid medication:Hold your puppy’s head in your non-dominant hand and the syringe in your dominant hand.
Place the syringe in your puppy’s mouth and angle it to the side. Do not angle it toward the back of the throat—the medication could end up in your puppy’s lungs.
Slowly empty the syringe. Place just a few drops in your puppy’s mouth at a time, giving it time to swallow and breathe.

, If your young puppy has cleft palate, it will likely need surgery to prevent aspiration pneumonia from happening again.During the surgery, your vet will close the opening in the top of your puppy’s mouth, lessening the chance of liquid or food going into the lungs.


Surgery could also be needed if your puppy breathed a foreign object into its lungs.If you decide on surgery, your vet will take special precautions to ensure your puppy does not accidentally breathe anything into its lungs before it has fully woken up from surgery.
Surgery can be expensive. If you have financial concerns, discuss these with your vet when deciding on whether your puppy should have surgery.

If your puppy is hypoglycemic, you'll first notice it moving more slowly and becoming restless. As the hypoglycemia worsens and your puppy’s brain is starved for glucose, your puppy will tremble, have a blank stare, and fall on its side.Other signs of hypoglycemia include:Wobbly walking
Shivering
Head tilt;
, As soon as you notice your young puppy looking restless, try feeding it some food.Eating a little bit of food may be enough to raise your puppy’s blood glucose back to normal levels.If your puppy does not want to eat, then you will need to feed it some sugar.


If your young puppy is still nursing, you may need to bottle feed it.

, A small dose of sugar will help to quickly raise your puppy’s blood glucose levels. Rather than giving your puppy sugar crystals, give it a liquid sugar source:Nutri-Cal® (available at your local pet store)
Maple syrup
Karo syrup
Molasses

, Give your puppy the sugar source by either rubbing a small amount on the gums with your finger or placing a few drops under your puppy’s tongue.Placing the sugar source on the gums or under the tongue will help it be absorbed more quickly by the body.One to two tablespoons of a sugar source is usually enough to revive a small dog with hypoglycemia.If your young puppy is really tiny, ask your vet about how much you should give.
You can also place a few drops of the sugar source on your puppy’s tongue.If you’re going to give drops of the sugar source, use a medicine dropper.
To prevent your puppy from choking, do not put the sugar source directly down its throat., In many instances of puppy hypoglycemia, just a small amount of sugar will be enough to revive the puppy.If the hypoglycemia is not severe, your puppy should perk back up in one to two minutes.If your puppy does not respond, contact your vet immediately.


Be aware that the sugar source is just a quick fix. Your puppy’s blood glucose levels may drop again, causing another episode of hypoglycemia.If your puppy becomes hypoglycemic again, give it more of the sugar source and contact your vet.

, If you needed to give your puppy a sugar source to handle its hypoglycemia, feed it a small amount of high-quality canned puppy food once it perks up.The food will give your puppy more glucose and help it recover.


If your puppy refuses the canned food, try feeding it some tasty treats., Even if your puppy looks fine after getting a little bit of sugar, your vet should still examine your puppy to determine if a health problem has caused the hypoglycemia. If your puppy did not respond at all to the sugar, then a vet visit is essential to get your puppy the intensive care it will need to recover.


Your puppy will also need to see your vet if it responded to the sugar, but became hypoglycemic again., Your vet will need to confirm that your young puppy has hypoglycemia. They will first perform a physical exam of your puppy. Then, they will take a small blood sample to measure your puppy’s blood glucose levels.Intestinal parasites can rob your young puppy’s body of important nutrients like glucose. Your vet may also perform a fecal exam to look for intestinal parasites., If your puppy has severe hypoglycemia, it will need immediate and intensive treatment by your vet. To administer this treatment, your vet will need to hospitalize your puppy for at least one day. Examples of intensive treatment for young puppies with hypoglycemia are:Intravenous dextrose (a type of sugar)
Deworming (kills intestinal parasites)
Heat therapy
Fluids

, A young puppy’s body cannot regulate its blood glucose levels very well. Feeding your young puppy multiple times a day, at the same times each day, can help prevent hypoglycemia.Puppies should eat three to four times a day.Leave the food out for 10 to 20 minutes. This will help prevent your puppy from becoming a picky eater—it will learn that it should eat right away, rather than pick at the food for a long time., A healthy puppy diet, when fed multiple times a day, will help keep your young puppy’s blood glucose levels from dropping too low. Also, high-quality puppy food will give your puppy the nutrients it needs to grow into a healthy adult dog.Many types of puppy diets are available. If you are unsure which one is right for your puppy, talk with your breeder or vet for guidance.
Puppies have specific nutritional needs. Do not feed your puppy an adult dog diet.
Canned foods tend to be tastier than dry foods.Your puppy may prefer canned food.
Realize that the feeding guidelines on the food label may not work for your young puppy. Talk with your vet to determine how much you should feed your puppy at each meal.

, A puppy should gain a little bit of weight every day. Daily weight gain means it’s eating enough food and getting enough nutrients, including glucose. Try weighing your puppy using a gram scale, which you can purchase a kitchen supply store. Record the weight on a piece of paper.If your young puppy is too big or wiggly for a gram scale, try this: Weigh yourself on a regular scale, then hold your puppy in your arms. To get your puppy’s weight, subtract your weight from the weight of you and your puppy.
If your puppy is not gaining weight, or is losing weight, it could be sick. Take your puppy to your vet.

, A cold puppy will use up extra glucose to stay warm, causing a condition called juvenile hypoglycemia. To prevent this type of hypoglycemia, wrap your young puppy in extra blankets to keep it warm. Also, keep your home at a warm temperature., Stress can cause a young puppy to become hypoglycemic. Examples of stressful events are vaccinations (or vet visits in general), over-handling, illness, and changes in a puppy’s environment.Minimizing your puppy’s stress can help prevent hypoglycemia.


Give your puppy treats when it behaves well at the vet’s office. That way, it may not get so stressed when it’s there.
Do not try to handle your puppy all the time. Give it some alone time so it can rest.
Keep your puppy’s routine the same from day to day.

It is important to assess your puppy’s health and a bonus to get it used to vet visits and socialization. Ask your vet what vaccinations your puppy needs, and if there are any potential health problems you should know about.Keep your puppy calm and happy by feeding it treats and bringing a toy along to play with in the exam room.;
, Weaned puppies under 4-6 months old should be fed three times a day to meet their nutritional needs, while puppies 6 months or older only need to be fed twice a day. To establish a solid routine, feed your puppy at the same time every day, and take the food away between meals if it is not touched. Note the times when food is left behind, how much is eaten, and when your puppy begs for food or seems hungry.Adapt your feeding schedule accordingly, if possible, or see a vet if your pet refuses to eat.

, Keeping track of when your puppy relieves itself can help you anticipate when it will need to go again and prevent future accidents and messes. Keep a notebook tracking when your puppy whines to go out, or makes a mess, and see if a clear pattern is evident. Try to bring your puppy outside, or to its designated bathroom area (e.g. a spot on the floor covered in puppy pads) around the same time, or a few minutes before, your puppy usually need to evacuate.Note that house training can take 4-6 months, but it is not uncommon for accidents to happen with puppies under a year old., To really understand your puppy’s day-to-day experience in your home, lower yourself onto the ground at its level to observe its environment. The rooms in your home will be incredibly different from your puppy’s vantage point – plants tower over it, forbidden items like electrical cords and shoes are right in front of it, and comfortable furniture is begging to be climbed onto. Seeing things from your puppy’s eyes will make its bad behavior more understandable and may help you reorganize your environment to be more puppy-friendly.For instance, keep power cords and outlets covered as much as possible, and store shoes on high shelves or on shoes racks where they will be less accessible.

, There are many smartphone apps available to help you care for and monitor your new puppy. These apps can help you track your pet’s weight, allergies, medications, vet appointments, and exercise. Also, you can store cute photos, videos, and anecdotes about your puppy. To help you get to know your puppy, try one of these apps:My Pet Diary, a free app that allows you to store your pet’s information, chart its growth, organize pictures, and record diaries about it.Pet Minder, an app (costing 0.99) that records important days and events related to your puppy (e.g. when you started giving him a specific kind of food, when he last visited the vet).
Pet Phone, an app that lets you track all of your pet’s health-related information (e.g. vet appointments, allergies) and syncs with your calendar to give you reminders.

Teach your puppy its name.,
Play with your puppy.,
Train your puppy.,
Keep your puppy groomed.,
Cuddle your puppy.",How to Get to Know Your Puppy2," Help your puppy learn its name by making positive associations with it. Call your puppy’s name and give it a treat when it responds; if it doesn’t respond, toss a treat its way every time you say its name regardless. Similarly, call your puppy’s name before giving your puppy its dinner, or petting it– it will start responding to its name very quickly., All dogs respond differently to games, teasing, and roughhousing – some enjoy it tremendously, while others get scared or bothered. To test this, try playing a particular game then stop, back up, and call your puppy to come sit with you. If it comes over happily, with its head high and tail wagging, it is likely enjoying the game; if it comes over with its head and tail lowered, walking uncertainly and not sitting when prompted, it is likely unhappy with the game and losing trust in you. Be sure to respect you puppy’s limits and play the games it prefers.To regain your puppy’s trust, continue prompting it to come and sit, and feed it treats and it complies.

, Training your puppy can be an excellent way to bond with it, in small, regular doses. At around 12-16 weeks old, puppies can be trained to respond to basic commands (i.e. “Sit”, “Stay”, “Come”, “Heel”, “Lie down”) in short session lasting 10-15 minutes each. For guidelines on how to train your puppy, visit the American Kennel Club’s website at http://www.akc.org/content/dog-training/articles/teach-your-puppy-these-5-basic-commands .

, Puppies are groomed regularly by their mothers during the first couple of weeks of their lives, so they associate gentle grooming with being cared for.It is also important to start grooming your new pet young so that it gets used to be handled by its owner, groomers, and veterinarians in the future. To start, use a gentle brush, and lightly stroke its back, giving it a treat every few strokes.If your puppy resists, try brushing it when it is sleepy and less likely to wiggle away or attack the brush.

, Puppies in a litter naturally cuddle together to keep warm, as huddling close prevents heat loss. Away from its litter, you puppy will be inclined to huddle up to you, other family members or pets to stay warm. Indulge your new pet and make time to cuddle it, which will heighten your bond."

Look for signs of bloating.",How to Stop a Dog from Eating Too Fast," Rather than dump the food into a dog dish, turn a metal non-tip bowl upside down. Spread the food in the ring surrounding the center. For your dog to get all the food, he has to circle around the bowl as well as pick his head up to shift to the other side.Even something this simple can slow your dog down a bit when it comes to eating and doesn't require any new equipment.;
, If you do want to purchase a commercial plastic bowl, try the Brake Fast Bowl or Slow Feeder. They are non-tip bowls with plastic knobs in the center. They don't have grip rings, so they can slide as dogs eat, requiring them to 'chase' their food.


You could also purchase a puzzle feeder. These make your dog work to uncover food by moving pieces of a puzzle aside.

, Either split the food between several small saucers and spread them around the room, or divide the food among the individual dips in a muffin or cupcake tin. This way at least the dog comes up for air between mouthfuls or has to find the saucers.

, Only use a large rock because some dogs will swallow stones if they are small enough. For small dogs, place 2 or 3 golf balls in a bowl and spread food around them. The dog will have to move the balls aside to eat, slowing him down.Be aware that this is only suitable for small dogs where a golf ball is too large to swallow.

, When all else fails, place the food bowl on a low table or chair. This forces the dog to put his paws on the surface and it slants his gullet downhill, which can help decrease the amount of air swallowed. It will also position his head up to make burping easier., Do you have more than one dog? You may find that your dog eats quickly because he fears the other dog will steal his food, or maybe he eats quickly in order to race over and eat the other dog's food. This behavior is called competitive eating., Feed your dogs from separate bowls placed at either end of the room. This gives each dog a chance to eat from his own bowl without the pressure of the other dog breathing down his neck. If the greedy dog is determined to steal food, then feed him in another room, out of sight of the other dog.This takes the pressure off the victim dog and removes the temptation of extra food for the greedy dog.

, You may find that your dog will still rush over to eat the rest of the other dog's food purely out of habit. This could be a result of food insecurity. Feeding him on time will create a sense of food security.


The dog might have had an unfortunate experience that made him feel this is necessary. For example, the owner was late home and the hungry dog found leftovers from an uneaten meal. When the next meal appeared, he bolted his food and went in search of leftovers (from his pal's dish) out of a sense of food insecurity.

, If he loves fuss and attention, distract him immediately after he finishes his food. Get him to sit and reward him with lots of positive attention. If this is done consistently, he will come over to you for attention, rather than dash over to the other dog's bowl., Persevere with the changes in feeding. While not everything may work, you might find something that helps your dog. Remember, it's going to take time for them to learn to slow down when eating.


If you still find that your dog is greedy or aggressive over food, it may be a possessiveness problem, rather than a speed eating problem. Dogs are most likely to be aggressive over food if one dog has something the other dog wants.

, When feeding your dog is more like throwing raw chicken at an alligator, it can be frustrating. But more than that, gulping down food can lead to several potentially harmful issues.


Never ignore a habit like eating too fast. Address the issue while keeping an eye out for developing health problems.

, When a dog races through his food, he is also swallowing a large amount of air. This can result in something simple like burping or passing gas, which is not enjoyable for those around but is relatively harmless., The faster the dog eats, the less he chews. This can cause him to choke if something large that needed to be chewed down to size passes down his esophagus., These include: bloated or swollen belly, walking hunched over, unsuccessful attempts to vomit, listlessness, and pacing. Always call your veterinarian if you suspect bloat. This is an emergency, and it is better to waste a phone call than miss a life-threatening problem.Bloating from food can increase the chance that your dog's stomach will twist, cutting off blood supply to the stomach. This can cause irreversible damage to the stomach or death. A dog suffering from this must be seen immediately by your veterinarian. There is no home remedy.

Figure out the correct dosing.,
Consult with your veterinarian about dosing for an older or unhealthy dog.,

Be on the look out for the possible adverse effects of fish oil.",How to Use Fish Oil for Dogs," Fish oil contains two types of omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA.) EPA and DHA are considered essential fatty acids (EFA) in that the body needs a dietary source of these fatty acids. They cannot be produced by the body.There is one other type of omega-3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is derived from plants. Dogs can only efficiently use EPA and DHA, as ALA needs to be converted by the body to fatty acids and the dog’s body inefficient at this conversion.;
, If your dog suffers from skin allergies, or painful arthritis, fish oil could help your dog's condition. It takes about 3-4 weeks for the levels of fish oil to build up in the body, so you need to keep giving a daily dose for at least a month to decide if it has helped your dog.If you’re supplementing a visibly healthy dog, you may not see any outward sign that the fish oil supplement is working.

, When dogs get older, their joints can get weaker. Fish oil tablets can help the tissue in the joints become stronger allowing an older dog to walk easier.


Heart attacks are also more common in older dogs and fish oil will help keep there heart healthy.
In both young and old large dogs, hip dysplasia can happen. However, adding fish oil to the dog's diet, in addition to exercising it with gentle swimming, can help build back the ligaments in the hips.

, While your veterinarian is the best source for dosing advice for a older or sick dog, general dosing instructions will work on a healthy dog. For healthy dogs, doses can range from 50 to 220 mg per kilogram of weight or 22 to 100 mg per pound of body weight. This range of dosages are usually well tolerated.Do not use any higher doses than these, as adverse effects can start at higher doses.
To make dosing easier, particularly for small dogs, manufacturers have made small capsules, chews and liquid forms. Generally the oil is placed on the food and most dogs readily eat it this way.

, If your dog is unhealthy or suffers from any disease ask your veterinarian for advice before using fish oil supplements. In some cases they can make a condition worse.

, If you are giving the fish oil in pill form, and your dog won't eat the pill, smear it with peanut butter before you give it to the dog. Follow with a dog treat to make sure the dog has swallowed the pill.

, Fish oils can cause some negative effects on a dog’s health if doses are not calculated correctly or if they are given to dogs with chronic health problems. In lower doses fish oil is usually well tolerated even by dog’s with health problems, but adverse effects can include:Increased bleeding
Stomach upset and diarrhea
Pancreatitis
Slower wound healing
Insulin sensitivity (use with caution in dogs with diabetes and only under a veterinarian’s guidance)
Weight gain
Toxin exposure (due to the problem with contamination of fish)

Be aware that dry dog food can spoil.,
Leave dry food in the original bag.,
Store dry dog food in a cool, dry place.",How to Store Dog Food1," Dry food isa convenient and cost effective way to feed a dog and requires minimal storage space. However, if the dry food is not stored properly, it can spoil and make your dog sick. The fats in the food can go rancid while vitamins can be destroyed if the proper conditions are not met., The original packaging for your dog’s dry food has a fat barrier that helps to keep it fresh. Although some people like to keep dry dog food in plastic storage containers, it is best to keep the food stored in the original bag.Bags of dry food can also be stored in the freezer if it takes you a long time to go through a bag.
If you prefer to use a storage container, make sure that it is air tight and that it is made from opaque material to protect the dry food from light. Stainless steel containers are also a good option., Dry dog food should be kept somewhere where the temperature is under 100 °F (38 °C)and where the food will be protected from moisture. For the most part, the best place to store dry food is in the house. Storing dry dog food in garages and sheds makes it hard to regulate the temperature unless these structures are insulated and temperature controlled."

Ask the shelter what they feed the dogs.,
Find a new type of food.,
Determine how much food you need to feed the dog.,
Find a comfortable area to feed the dog.",How to Transition a Dog from Shelter Food to Different Food1," When you adopt the dog, you should ask the shelter or rescue what type of food that the dogs eats. Make sure they tell you what brand and type of food (puppy, large breed, mature, etc.) that they gave the dog. Some shelters may even be able to provide you with a few days’ worth of the food. You will need at least a two week supply of it. You can ask the shelter:


""What type of food did you feed the dog? Is there a particular brand or formulation that you used?""
""How much did you feed them a day?""
""What times of day did you feed the dog?""
""Do you know where I can find the same brand of food? Is there a local store that sells it or can I buy it from you?"";
, Start researching what type of food you want to feed your new dog. Decide whether you will be feeding them wet canned food, dry kibble, or a raw diet. Different sizes and ages of dogs require different types of foods. You should look for a food that is formulated for your dog’s specific needs.



Puppies, pregnant dogs, and nursing dogs should eat specially formulated puppy food.
Dogs over the age of seven years should be eating a formula designed for older or mature dogs.Dogs over twelve months of age should be eating an adult dog food that is appropriate for their size. Dog foods are often labeled for “small,” “medium,” or “large” breeds. A good adult dog food will contain at least 18% protein and less than 350 calories per cup of food., The amount of food you need to feed your dog will vary based on the dog’s size, activity level, and health. The instructions on the side of the food bag or can should tell you how much is appropriate to feed your dog. You can also consult your vet.


You can calculate an estimate of your dog’s caloric needs. Weigh the dog in kilograms, and multiply that number by thirty. Add 70 to this number to get a rough idea of how many calories they need a day.For example, if your dog weighs nine kg (or twenty pounds), they should be eating 340 calories a day. Measure out the right amount of calories by consulting nutritional information located on the food's packaging.
If your dog is very active, you may need to feed them more. Older and less active dogs may need to be fed less.
It is generally advised to feed the dog twice a day., When your dog comes home from the shelter, they may be stressed, anxious, or uncertain about their surroundings. Make sure that the dog is comfortable in their new home. Place the dog’s food bowl in a quiet area out of the way of children and other pets. Do not make loud noises while the dog is eating."

Consider the food transition when your dog is approximately one year old.,
Switch sooner if your dog is spayed or neutered or becomes overweight.,
Take your dog's breed into consideration.,
Assess your dog's weight.,
Discuss an appropriate new food with your veterinarian.,
Make the transition to adult food gradually.,
Be willing to slow down the food transition.,
Try a different food if necessary.,
Adjust the frequency and amount of food your dog is receiving.",How to Transition from Puppy to Adult Dog Food," As a general rule, most dogs should transition off of puppy food and on to adult food when they are around one year old. This is when most dogs reach their full adult size and no longer need a huge amount of calories to support growth.Changing your dog's food when it is one year old is a general rule. Depending on other factors, your dog may need to switch a few months earlier or a few months later than its first birthday. The most common reason you might need to switch your puppy to dog food early is if he has gained too much weight or has been neutered.;
, Keep a puppy on puppy food until they are 12 months old, or change earlier if they are neutered or if they become overweight.


Depending on how old your dog is when it gets fixed, you may want to feed it puppy food for a few months afterword.

, Different dog breeds should be switched off of puppy food at different times. This is due to the differences in periods of growth for different types of dogs and when they reach their full grown size. In general, large dog breeds should be kept on puppy food for longer than small or toy breed dogs because they take longer to reach their full size.In general, large breed dogs, such as great Danes, should be kept on puppy food until they are 13 to 14 months old.
In general, small breed dogs, such as Chihuahuas, should be kept on puppy food until they are 7 to 9 months old.

, A puppy that is overweight may need to be switched off of puppy food sooner than expected. A puppy that is underweight may need to stay on puppy food until it gets its weight up. Discuss your dog's weight with its veterinarian and come up with a plan to get the dog to an ideal weight. This could be done by switching the dog to adult food, giving it fewer meals each day, or simply lowering the amount of puppy food it gets.Most often, your puppy will be weighed when it goes to the veterinarian. Your vet will tell you its weight and whether that weight is within a normal range.

, Once you have decided to switch your dog's food from puppy food to adult food you will need to find an adult food that is good for your dog. The easiest way to pick an adult food is to discuss options with your veterinarian. There are so many choices out there that it can be overwhelming without a little guidance.


When discussing adult food options with your veterinarian, be honest about your financial situation and what you can afford to pay for dog food. Your veterinarian may then be able to give you a few options that will be within your budget.

, If you try to switch your dog's food too abruptly it can get very sick due to a lack of bacteria that can digest a different food.Its system is simply not prepared to digest a new food. With this in mind, you will need to switch your dog's food gradually, adding a little bit more of the new food and a little bit less of the old food for every meal over the course of a week.This means that for the first couple of days transitioning food you mix a quarter new food with three quarters old food.
On the third and fourth days you mix half new food and half old food.
On the fifth and sixth days you mix together three quarters new food with one quarter old food.
On the seventh day you give the dog just the new food.

, While in most cases the food transition can happen over the course of one week, some dogs have delicate systems that require a longer period to get used to new food. If your dog is having difficulty digesting its new food, then slow down the pace. Mix less of the new food in to its previous food and wait until it is easily digesting a mixture before moving forward with transition.Signs that your dog is having a hard time adjusting to its new food usually include digestive problems, including vomiting or diarrhea.

, There is the chance that your dog will simply reject the new dog food that you have chosen. If your dog refuses to eat the new food, even when mixed with the old food, then you may need to find a new dog food.


This is common if you are trying to transition between wet and dry dog food. A dog that is used to one or the other may have a hard time eating a different consistency of food. In general, however, wet food is often more palatable to dogs and you may have a hard time getting your dog to eat kibble once it has eaten wet food., Once your dog is on its new adult diet, you will need to adjust the amount of food that it is receiving. The new food will have a different caloric content and you will need to take that in to account. To begin with, follow the directions on the food packaging, which usually suggests a serving size based on your dog's weight and age.As with the type of adult food you are feeding your dog, you can discuss serving size with your dog's veterinarian. They should be able to suggest how many calories your dog should be eating per day.

Keep unopened cans of dog food in a cupboard or pantry.,
Store opened cans in the refrigerator.,
Follow USDA guidelines for storing homemade dog food.,
Freeze wet food that will not be used within five days.,
Throw away food that has been left out for more than four hours.",How to Store Dog Food2," Canned food will last a while as long as they are stored in a cool, dry place. The best place to store canned dog food is in a cupboard or pantry inside of your home.Do not store them where they will get wet or in a humid or moist environment as the cans may tarnish and the inner seal may degrade and cause the food to spoil.

, Once you’ve opened a can of dog food, it can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two days. Just make sure to use a plastic can lid (many veterinary clinics give these out) or a tight-fitting aluminum foil temporary lid to keep the food from drying out.Try writing the date that you opened the can on the label so that you can be sure that you are using the food within the appropriate time range.

, Homemade foods can consist of a wide variety of food: different types of meat, eggs, vegetables, grains, and fruits are often used. As a general guideline, follow the recommended storage times for meats, which are the most perishable foods in homemade diets. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) meats should be stored at refrigerator temperatures (40 °F or 4 °C or less) for the following days:Raw ground meats, all poultry, and seafood may be refrigerated for one to two days.
Raw roasts, steaks, and chops may be refrigerated for three to five days.
Cooked meat, poultry, and seafood may be refrigerated for three to four days.

, Homemade dog food and canned dog food can also be stored in the freezer. Just make sure to put the food into freezer bags or storage containers first. Canned food and homemade food will keep in the freezer for up to four to six months.Try portioning your dog's food so that you only need to defrost one baggie or container of food at a time for his meals.

, Canned and homemade dog food can spoil if left out of the refrigerator for too long. If an open can of dog food or some homemade dog food has been sitting in a dog bowl or on a counter, be sure to throw it away after four hours.Do not give your dog food that has been sitting out for long periods of time. Doing so may cause your dog to get sick, which could result in some expensive veterinary bills.

Add a little bit of new food to the old food.,
Mix equal amounts of the old and new food.,
Increase the amount of new food to 75%.,
Stop feeding the dog the old food.",How to Transition a Dog from Shelter Food to Different Food2," You will need to start introducing the new food gradually. To start, feed the dog a mixture of old food and new food with a ratio of 75% old to 25% new. For example, if your dog needs two cups of kibble, you should feed them one and a half cups of the old food and half a cup of the new food. Continue this for between one and three days.If you are switching the dog from dry to wet food, you can simply stir the wet food into the bowl with the dry food., If three days have passed without problem, you can increase the amount of new food that you feed the dog. Mix equal amounts of the old food and the new food together. For example, if the dog is eating two cups of kibble, mix one cup of the old food and one cup of the new food. This period should last for up to three days., If the dog is still eating the new food without problem, you can start feeding even more of the new food. At this point, the dog should be eating meals that are 75% new food and 25% old food. For example, one and a half cups of new food should be mixed with half a cup of old food. This period should last for up to another three days., If the dog has not experienced any trouble with the new food, you can stop feeding the dog their old food entirely. This typically happens at around day ten of the transition."
"
Watch for signs of stomach problems.,
Slow down if the dog gets sick.,
Transition slowly back to the old food.,
Consult a vet.",How to Transition a Dog from Shelter Food to Different Food3," Gas, vomiting, and diarrhea are symptoms of a problematic diet for the dog. If the dog is exhibiting any of these symptoms, they may not be adjusting to their new food. To ensure that they are in good condition, you should inspect the dog’s feces after they eliminate. Look for runny or loose stools; these indicate that the dog is having gastrointestinal distress.Consult your vet to find a better food.

, If at any point at the process the dog starts vomiting or having diarrhea, you should give them a few extra days on the last step of the process. For example, if you just increased the ratio of new food to 75% and they are having problems, return to feeding them a 50-50 ratio of old and new food. After a few days, try increasing the amount of new food again.Because different dogs adjust differently to food transitions, it is important that you keep extra food on hand. While most dogs may take ten days to transition to new food, you should have at least a two week supply of the old food, if not more, just in case the dog does not transition well.

, If you have tried slowing down the feeding transition and the dog is still sick, they may be allergic to an ingredient in the new dog food. Slowly transition the dog back to their old food by gradually increasing the old food and decreasing the new food., If the dog’s stomach problems continue or if the dog is refusing to eat, you should visit their vet for advice. The vet may be able to diagnose an allergy, find a balanced food that benefits the dog, or recognize another underlying condition that may be causing their problems."
"
Limit treats.,
Change foods if the dog refuses.,
Move the food to a different area.",How to Transition a Dog from Shelter Food to Different Food4," If you are giving the dog too many treats once you bring them home from the shelter, they may not eat their meals, delaying the transition to the new food and damaging their overall nutrition. You should try to avoid giving the dog too many treats between meals to encourage them to eat their food.


You can give the dog dental chews or bones in between meals if the dog wants something to chew., The dog may refuse to eat the new food or they may eat around it to get to their old food. If this happens, you can try another brand of dog food. If this continues for a couple days, switch to a different dog food. Transition to the new food using the same method that you tried with your first attempt. You should not change the brand every time the dog refuses. Rather, only switch the food if the dog consistently refuses the food over several days.
The dog may fast for a day, but they normally should start eating the food again after that. If they fast for longer than a day, you may want to consider changing the brand, flavor, or type of food.

, If the dog is not eating, they may not be comfortable in the area where the food is placed. Try moving it to another, quieter area. Make sure to guide the dog to the bowl so that they know where you have moved it. Leave the dog alone while they eat."

Add flavor and electrolytes to the water.,
Use a syringe if necessary.,
Exercise the dog.,
Feed the dog wet food.,
Make food only available at mealtimes.,
Let the dog out to pee whenever necessary.,
Give the dog constant access to water.,
Change the water frequently.,
Consider a pet fountain.,
Add ice cubes on hot days.,
Make the water more exciting.",How to Make Your Dog Drink Water," Most healthy dogs are pretty good at managing their own water consumption. Check for the following signs of ill health or dehydration before you get too concerned:


Gently pinch a fold of the dog's skin at the back of the dog's neck or between the shoulder blades, and let go. If the skin doesn't immediately return to the original position, your dog may be dehydrated.
Gently press your finger against your dog's gums until the color lightens, then lift your finger. If the gums don't immediately return to the original color, your dog may be dehydrated.Other possible signs of dehydration include lethargy, loss of appetite, or a change in the amount or color of your dog's urine. By themselves, these are not cause for urgent concern unless they are severe or last more than a day.;
, Life stages and medical issues can increase the frequency and severity of dehydration. Err on the side of caution if any of the following apply to your dog:


Vomiting, diarrhea, or excessive panting or drooling can all cause dehydration if the dog does not drink more water to compensate.
If your dog is diabetic, pregnant, nursing, very young, or very old, take the dog to a veterinarian at the first suspicion of dehydration.

, If your dog demonstrates one of the above symptoms, and refuses to drink water, visit a veterinarian as soon as possible. The veterinarian may give the dog a saline IV or a subcutaneous fluid injection to rapidly restore fluids to the dog.


A veterinarian will also be able to test for medical problems that could be causing dehydration, such as kidney stones. After diagnosis, the vet may prescribe medication or a special diet.

, If your dog shows symptoms of dehydration and you can't get to a veterinarian immediately, dilute Pedialyte rehydration fluid with an equal amount of water and give about 1 cup (240 mL) of the mixture to your dog once an hour.Pedialyte is available at drug stores.


Do not mix this with any other ingredients, or you could cause further damage to the dog.
While other rehydration fluids are available, consulting a veterinarian before using them is recommended whenever possible.
Inhabitants of the US can use the Pedialyte website to locate the nearest store that carries it.

, If you can't find any Pedialyte, pour in a little low-sodium chicken broth or diluted carrot juice to the water. This can help replenish electrolytes lost to dehydration, and may make the water more enticing to your sick dog.

, If your sick dog completely refuses to drink, fill a plastic, needle-less syringe with water and squirt it into your dog's mouth. Squirt in the dog's cheek, not directly down the throat, to prevent choking.

, Dogs need daily exercise, such as a brisk walk or playing in a park or backyard. If your dog doesn't get enough exercise, it may not be losing much moisture to panting, and so won't be as thirsty as a healthily active dog.


On long walks, bring along water and give the dog a swallow every ten minutes or so. This can help get the dog in the habit of drinking regularly at home.

, Wet food contains a great deal of water already, usually marked on the can as ""% moisture content."" Replace some or all of the dog's dry food with wet, checking the label or a vet's recommendation to determine how much food the dog needs.


Alternatively, soak dry food in a bowl of water for 30–60 minutes before giving it to your dog.

, Feed your dog once or twice a day, according to your vet's recommendation or the label of your dog food. If food is constantly available, some dogs will mistake thirst for hunger.

, If your dog is stuck indoors for eight hours at a time, it could be avoiding water because it's learned that causes an uncomfortably full bladder. Let your dog out to pee whenever it whines at the door, or train it to use an indoor litter box.

, In a multistory home, put a bowl of water on each floor the dog has access to. If the dog spends part of the day outdoors or shut in a room, put an additional bowl of water in these locations.


Try to keep these ""water stations"" in the same place so your dog knows where to look for water.
A dog tied outside may get its chain or rope tangled, preventing it from accessing the water dish.If there is no alternative to tying it up, keep the area free from obstructions and place the water dish next to the stake.

, Empty the water bowl daily and rinse out any debris before refilling it, then wipe the sides with a paper towel. Change the water again whenever you notice hair or dirt floating in it, or whenever the water level is getting low. During hot weather, you may need to check the bowl every couple hours.

, These bowl-sized fountains may be more attractive to dogs that prefer running water, or young puppies who aren't used to drinking from a bowl. These are also easier to find for dogs with vision problems.

, Many dogs prefer drinking cold water. Toss in a couple ice cubes. Do this while the dog is watching, and it may come over to investigate.

, If you don't want to buy a fountain, try shaking the bowl of water instead, or waving a toy over it. Dropping blueberries or other small treats in the water can also convince a dog to drink as it fishes them out.


If the dog still isn't interested, try again after replacing the doggie bowl with an ordinary cup or bowl with a different shape or color.

Buy a puppy formula.,
Purchase a puppy bottle.,
Use an eyedropper or syringe if the puppy is too small.",How to Safely Formula Feed Puppies1," When feeding your puppy formula, you need to make sure that you buy the right kind of formula. Puppies have specific nutritional needs, so you need make sure the formula is specifically for puppies.You can get puppy formula from the vet or from a pet store.
There are dry or canned varieties. Either type is fine, but dry is more cost-efficient in the long run.;
, To feed your puppy, you should get a puppy nursing bottle. This holds a small amount of formula. You can purchase one of these bottles at a pet store.When you get the bottle, you will need to put a hole in the nipple. Use a flame-heated needed. Put two small holes in the point of the nipple.
Make sure the holes are only big enough to let a few drops of milk to come out. Holes that are too large can lead to the puppy getting formula in the lungs. Holes that are too small will lead to too much air.

, Toy or tiny breeds may be too small to feed from a bottle when they are first born. If this is the case, you should use an eyedropper. If the puppy can’t suckle yet, you can gently squeeze the formula into the side of the mouth.You can also use a syringe to squeeze the formula into the mouth.
Don’t squeeze the milk directly into the back of the puppy’s mouth. It could lead to choking.

Blend the formula well.,
Get the formula to the right temperature.,
Store the formula properly.",How to Safely Formula Feed Puppies2," When you are preparing dry formula, make sure that you mix it together very well. Get rid of all clumps or pockets of dry formula. It should all be blended and smooth.Wait for the bubbles to get out of the formula before feeding it to the dogs.

, Before you give the puppy formula, you need to get it to the right temperature. Place the bottle in a mug or bowl of hot water. Don’t heat the formula itself in the microwave or in a pot.Put the formula on your wrist to test the temperature. It should be warm, but not hot.

, Make sure to keep your formula stored properly to keep your puppy safe. After mixing or opening formula, you keep it in the refrigerator and use it all day. However, you should throw away the leftover formula at the end of the day.If you use dry formula, you can keep the canister in the freezer. Don’t place the cans in the freezer.

Record the symptoms.,
Track how long they have had the issue.,
Consider what the dog has eaten.,
Inspect their feces.,
Take the dog to the vet.",How to Treat Digestive Problems in a Dog You Just Adopted1," Write down all of the dog’s symptoms as they occur. Not only should you record what symptoms the dog is having but also note when they are occurring and what you think might be causing them. For example, if the dog vomits after eating food, there may be a problem with what you are feeding them. Some symptoms you should look out for include:Vomiting
Gas
Diarrhea
Constipation
Regurgitation
Blood or mucus in their feces
Weakness or lethargy;
, If the dog has only been home with you for a few days, call the shelter, and ask them if the dog has had the same problems in the past. Explain the dog’s symptoms to them. They may be able to check the dog’s record to see if the problems are chronic or not. You can ask:


”Do you know if the dog has had vaccinations in the past? If so, which vaccinations did they receive?”
“Are there any issues with parasites at your kennel?”
“Have you noticed these symptoms in the past with this dog? How about with other dogs in the shelter?”
“Is this a common problem when dogs return home?”
“What did you feed the dog while they were in your shelter? Can you tell me the brand and type of food? Is there somewhere nearby I can find this food?”

, One common digestive issue that affects recently adopted dogs is a sudden change in diet. When a dog switches to a new type or brand of food, their stomachs may need a few days to adjust. Furthermore, dogs in a new home may be curious, and they may eat things that they shouldn’t.


Changing a dog’s diet too suddenly can cause them to have an upset stomach with diarrhea or gas. Normally, you should transition their diet by mixing their old shelter food with their new food. If you did not do this, revert to the dog's old diet. Feed them whatever food they were fed in the shelter, and watch to see if symptoms disappear.Dogs who are fed “people food” or table scraps may have problems with the high fat content found in these foods. Furthermore, some foods that are safe for humans to eat, such as chocolate or garlic, are not safe for dogs to consume., When the dog eliminates, take a careful look at their feces. Normal dog stool should be brown and shaped like a log (although if the dog is on a raw food diet, the feces may be white and crumbly). You should be able to pick it up without it crumbling, falling apart, or running through your fingers.If the dog’s stool is liquid, runny, or loose, they may have diarrhea or a related problem. If their stool is small, crumbly, and dry, they may have constipation.


If the dog has blood or discolored mucus in their feces, take them to a vet immediately.
If the dog’s feces are yellow, green, black, or orange, tell your vet.

, If the dog’s symptoms last longer than 24 hours, take the dog to the vet to be tested. Or, if the dog is vomiting for more than four hours or can't keep fluids down, then take them to the vet right away. There are a number of problems that could cause digestive issues in a dog, including parasites, bacterial or viral infection, inflammation, or allergies. The vet can do a number of tests, including fecal tests, blood tests, electrolyte tests, x-rays, and endoscopies.Be sure to tell the vet:


Any symptoms you have recorded
How long the symptoms have lasted
When the symptoms typically appear
What the dog has been eating recently
If the dog has swallowed an inedible or poisonous object

If you have a very big dog, such as a Great Dane, consider getting a 6-gallon (227-liter) paint bucket instead.If the bucket has a handle, be sure to take it off.

, You want the bowl to be small enough so that it will fit inside the trashcan's opening. At the same time, you want it to be big enough so that its rim will sit comfortably on the trashcan's rim. If the bowl is too big, it will roll around on top of the trashcan instead. This can lead to spilled food and water.

If you can't find a bowl the right size, find a plastic lid that can sit on top of the trashcan, then cut a hole in it for the bowl to fit through.
The bowl must have a rim; it is what will hold it up.

, The extra length will allow you to make a nice, finished seam. The extra height will cover you if the fabric starts to go on crooked. Remember, it is always easier to cut off excess fabric than to add more on.

If your trashcan has tapering sides, you might want to add several more inches to accommodate the sloopes., Choose a fabric that suits the decor of your home. It can be solid-colored or patterned. Cotton would work best for this, but canvas or linen would also look nice.

If your bowl is made out of metal, consider a solid-beige color. This will work great with the rope you'll be adding later.
For a sea-side theme, choose a solid-blue color. This will work great with white rope.

, If your trashcan has a seam, place the edge of the fabric against that seam. Use your fingers to smooth out any wrinkles. Try to leave an equal amount of fabric to the top and bottom of your trashcan.

Use a wide paintbrush or foam brush for this. You will be working in small sections at a time, but a tiny paintbrush will take too long.
If you can't find any Mod Podge, you can use another type of decoupage glue. You can also use watered-down white school glue (3 parts glue to 1 part water).

, Once when you are back to where you started, you will find that you have a few inches of extra fabric leftover. Do not glue this fabric down yet., Folding the fabric under by ½ inch (1.72 centimeters) would be ideal. If you don't have enough fabric for that, don't worry; just fold the edge under as much as you can. Paint on a thin stripe of Mod Podge, then press the seam down onto it., The fabric will be much easier to cut once it is dry; you also won't have to worry about ruining your scissors.

If the trashcan has a rim, you can run a craft blade right along it; this will cut off the excess fabric neatly.If the glue is taking too long to dry, set it out in the sun.

, The design can be as simple as a dog bone, a word (ie: FOOD or WATER), or your dog's name. You can also make it more ornate by painting on a small background first, such as an oval with scalloped edges, letting it dry, and then writing your dog's name on top.

This is not completely necessary, but it can make your raised dog bowl look nicer.

, This will help seal your design, and protect the fabric. Make sure that the finish you are using is waterproof or weather-resistant. This way, if the can gets dirty, you can just wipe it clean.

Alternatively, you can also coat your entire bucket with clear, acrylic spray sealer.

, You will need enough rope to wrap around the top and bottom of your trashcan. Something that is the same thickness as your finger would work well, but keep proportions in mind. The larger the trashcan, the thicker your rope should be; the smaller the trashcan, the thinner your rope will be.

If you went with a metal bowl and beige-colored fabric, thick, hemp rope will work great.
If you went with a sea-side theme, hemp rope or white cord would look wonderful.
If your fabric has a pattern on it, consider using white cord. You can also paint some rope black (or another matching color) with spray paint.

, Glue the rope down just above the bottom edge, so that the trashcan can still stand firmly on the ground. Glue the other rope just under the rim, so that it does not get in the bowl's way. Because hot glue sets quickly, only squeeze out a few inches of glue at a time., If the trashcan is not very stable, fill it with some heavy rocks first. Alternatively, you can fill the trashcan or bucket with your dog's food, be it canned or kibble."

Give your puppy the correct amount of formula.,
Feed the puppy regularly.,
Make sure not to overfeed the puppies.,
Feed the puppy correctly.,
Clean the materials properly.",How to Safely Formula Feed Puppies3," You should make sure to feed your puppy the correct amount of food each day. This ensures they grow at the right weight and gain weight at the proper rate. These are approximate. Make sure to only feed the puppy until the belly is a gentle round shape. Divide the total for the day by the number of feedings per day.In the first week, feed the puppy around 25 to 35 milliliters (0.8 to 1  fl oz) for every 100 grams (3.5 oz) of body weight. In week two, try 15 to 20 milliliters (0.51 to 0.68  fl oz) for every 100 grams (3.5 oz). Week three and four, give 20 mL for every 100 grams.

, You should give the puppy food every two to three hours. This is around eight to ten meals per day. At three weeks, you can feed the dog around six times each day. At five weeks, the puppy should be eating solid foods, but you can still feed them formula two to three each day.Make sure to burp the puppy after feeding. Hold the puppy with their belly against your shoulder. Gently pat the puppy on the back until it burps.

, Puppies may not know when to stop eating. This can lead to overfeeding. Overfeeding may lead to health problems, like milk in the lungs, pneumonia, or diarrhea.Feed the puppy many small meals through the day instead of less larger meals.
Make sure there are no bubbles of milk coming out of the puppy’s nose. This can point to overfeeding.

, Make sure the puppy is on their stomach. Place the nipple in the puppy’s mouth and press the bottle enough so that one to two drops of milk come out. This will help the puppy figure out that the milk is in the nipple, and they will start to suck.Don’t place the puppy upside down, upright, or on their back to feed them.

, Between each use, you should clean the materials. This ensures that you don’t contaminate the formula and make the puppy sick. Clean the bottles, syringes, eyedroppers, and other material by boiling them for 10 minutes. Do this after every feeding.If you’re using syringes, make sure to remove the plungers.

Know when to formula feed your puppy.,
Consult your veterinarian.,
Look for any problems.",How to Safely Formula Feed Puppies4," There are a few reasons why you may need to formula feed your puppy. You may need to help if you have a mother dog who is struggling to feed her puppies or who cannot produce milk. Some mother dogs will neglect their puppies. If the mother dog dies, you will have to feed the puppies.You should also formula feed runts, which are the dogs that have body weights that are at least 20 percent less than the rest of the litter.

, Though you will be doing the work of feeding your puppies, you should contact your veterinarian. Tell your veterinarian that you are bottle feeding your puppies. The vet can give you advice and help you if you run into any problems.You have probably been in contact with your vet about your puppy, so just let them know during one of your visits you are formula feeding the puppy.

, Puppies can fade fast if something goes wrong. Look for symptoms of nutritional problems like diarrhea, decreased saliva, depression, weakness, limpness, and frigid skin. If any of these things occur, you should consult your veterinarian.Pay attention to the puppy’s stool. Stools with clumps happen when the formula is too thick and concentrated. Dilute the formula and increase the frequency of feeding. You can put pedialyte in the formula if the puppy has diarrhea.

Avoid giving your dog food for a day.,
Feed them plain food.,
Provide plenty of fresh water.,
Offer the dog ice chips.,
Give the dog Pedialyte.,
Feed the dog with a syringe.,
Treat poisonous substances with cooking oil.",How to Treat Digestive Problems in a Dog You Just Adopted2," When your dog first starts experiencing diarrhea, stop feeding them for between twelve and twenty-four hours. This will prevent further episodes. If they keep having diarrhea after you have taken the food away, or they are vomiting, contact your vet.


If you have a puppy, only fast them for twelve hours. You can place a little bit of pancake syrup on their gums to make sure that they are getting a little bit of energy., If they can keep their food down or if you have already fasted the dog, you should try giving them plain, cooked foods. These foods should not be spiced, greasy, or processed. Some foods you can give your dog include:


Boiled and shredded chicken mixed with rice
Banana baby foodMashed pumpkin, Digestive issues can often dehydrate a dog, especially if they are vomiting or having diarrhea. Make sure your dog is drinking plenty of fresh water. Change the water at least twice a day. If your dog is not drinking, try leading them to the bowl or placing the bowl near them to encourage them to drink.Give the dog small amounts of water. Too much water at one time can cause them to vomit.Add a little bit of water to whatever food you give them. This can help hydrate them as they eat.

, If the dog is drinking too much water at once, they may start vomiting. This will only increase their dehydration. If you suspect this is the case with your dog, give them ice chips instead. The dog will suck on the ice chip slowly.


Try freezing Gatorade ice cubes to help restore the electrolytes your dog has lost by vomiting.
If the dog has not vomited for four hours, you can reintroduce small amounts of water. Start by giving half a cup of water, and monitor them to see if they can keep it down., If the dog is having trouble keeping food down or if they are dehydrated, you can give them Pedialyte to restore electrolytes and vitamins to their system. You can use unflavored Pedialyte bought at the drugstore or animal-friendly powder mix bought found at a farming store.If you bought powder, you can mix it with water according to the instructions on the packet.
If the dog is able to keep water down, you can add Pedialyte, Gatorade, or meat broth (with no onion or garlic) to their water bowl. Dilute the liquid with an equal amount of water., If the dog is not eating or drinking at all, you may have to feed them Pedialyte with a syringe. Fill the needleless syringe with Pedialyte, and place it between their gums and cheek on one side of their mouth. Gently press out the liquid into their mouth. It is highly advised that you get your vet to show you the proper method to do this, as sick dogs are likelier to choke or aspirate on the food., If you think that the dog has consumed a petroleum based product — such as gasoline, motor oil, or lighter fluid — or if they have swallowed a cleaning product — like antibacterial spray or laundry detergent — give them a tablespoon or two of cooking oil. Contact an emergency vet immediately. Do not induce vomiting."
"
Give the dog their medications.,
Check for dehydration.,
Take the dog outside.,
Return to the vet if necessary.",How to Treat Digestive Problems in a Dog You Just Adopted3," If the vet prescribed you a medication, you should have it filled at their animal hospital or at a local pharmacy. Follow the vet’s instructions for administering the medication to the dog.If the vet gave you a pill, ask if the pill can be given with food. If it can be, put a little peanut butter or cream cheese on the pill to encourage the dog to swallow it.
If the pill can't be given with food, place your hand on the top of the dog’s muzzle and gently squeeze near the canines until the dog opens their mouth. Place the pill on the back of their tongue, and close their mouth., Dehydration is a serious side effect of digestive problems. If untreated, it can lead to organ failure. If your dog is not drinking or if they continue vomiting for over twenty-four hours, you may need to have a vet give them fluids using an IV. You can tell if a dog is dehydrated using a few simple methods. If the dog fails any of these tests, return to the vet.


Check the dog’s gums to see if they are wet. If the gums appear dry, they may be dehydrated.
Press down on the gums with your finger until you notice a change in color. If the dog is hydrated, the original color will return as soon as you remove your finger. If it takes a few seconds to regain color, the dog may be dehydrated. Be careful with this method if the dog is still unfamiliar with you as they may bite.
Gently grasp the scruff of their neck, and tug it upwards. If the skin retracts immediately, they are fine. If the skin sticks and or does not snap into place, the dog may be dehydrated., Make sure that the dog has plenty of opportunities to go outside, especially if they are vomiting or having diarrhea. Not only will this allow them to eliminate safely, they may also start to eat grass. While the reasons that dogs eat grass are largely unclear, many nauseous dogs will eat grass to settle their stomachs or to induce vomiting. This may be a natural way to help your dog feel better.Do not worry if the dog vomits after eating grass. This is normal. Some dogs may even eat grass to help them empty their stomachs.

, If the dog is dehydrated or if vomiting and diarrhea continue, contact the vet. The vet may decide to run more tests. They may also try to deliver fluids and food via IV or syringe.

Transition the dog to new dog food slowly.,
Dog proof your home.,
Monitor what they eat closely.",How to Treat Digestive Problems in a Dog You Just Adopted4," If you are feeding the dog a different brand or type of food than they were eating at the shelter, you should try to slowly transition them to the new food. Find out what the shelter was feeding them. Mix a little bit of new food in with the old food. Over ten days, gradually increase the amount of new food that you give them while decreasing the amount of old food. In general, you can follow this schedule to transition the food:Day one to three: mix 75% old food mixed in with 25% new food

Day four to six: mix 50% old food mixed in with 50% new food

Day seven to nine: mix 25% old food mixed in with 75% new food

Day ten: feed them only the new food

, To make sure that your new dog does not get ahold of anything that could upset their stomach, you should make sure that all potentially dangerous substances, plants, and objects are out of the way. To dog-proof your home, you can:Put cleaning supplies, medicines, chemicals, and lotions on higher shelves or locked cabinets.
Cover trashcans or place them inside a cabinet or closet.
Place the toilet lid down.
Make sure food is out of reach.
Clean up antifreeze, motor oil, and gasoline from the garage floor or driveway.
Pick up small objects, such as buttons, spools of thread, or plastic toys, from the ground.

, Make sure that the dog is only eating food that is safe for them. Limit how much “people food” you give them, and make sure you never give them food that contains chocolate, garlic, or onions. Keep the dog away from trash.If the vet has diagnosed an allergy, make sure never to feed the dog food that contains the offensive ingredient. You should read the ingredients of all treats and dog food that you purchase in the future.

Set your dog's bowl into the hole and fill it with food.",How to Make Raised Dog Bowls2," This will be the height you need to look for when choosing your base.The base should be level with your dog's lower chest.

, Choose a material that is easy to cut with a jigsaw, such as wood or plastic. Avoid metal. Here are some ideas for bases to get you started:


If you have a small dog, you could use a short, wooden bench or stool. If you have a medium-sized dog, a wooden create would work great.
If you have a big dog, consider using a larger wooden crate, or even a storage unit with doors and drawers., The bowl must have a rim, as this is what will help hold it up. The bigger the rim is, the more stable the bowl will be. If you are using a wide base, you might even be able to fit one or two more bowls.

, If you don't have a compass, you can simply flip the bowl upside down onto your base, trace around the edge with a pencil, then draw a slightly smaller circle inside of it; be sure to erase the outer circle when you are done.








If you plan on adding more than one bowl to your base, remember to leave room for the rims.

, Make sure that the hole is big enough for the tip of your jigsaw to go through. Also, make sure that the hole goes all the way through your base.








If you are using a wooden crate, you may not need to drill a hole. As long as your jigsaw blade can fit between the slates, you should be fine.

, Slide the jigsaw blade into the hole, then turn the jigsaw on. Carefully cut around the line that you drew until the circle falls out.Save the cut-out disk for another project, or discard it.








, You will be placing your dog's bowl into this hole, so most of the jaggedness will be covered up.If the jaggedness really bothers you, however, or if it gets in the way of the bowl, you can sand it away. Start with a coarser grit, and finish off with a finer one.








, This is especially important if you plan on painting or sealing your base. If you do not wish to paint your base, you are done at this point. If you can either seal the base with a wood stain and sealer, or you can simply place your dog's bowl into the hole and fill it with food., This will help smooth out the texture, and help the paint stick to it better. You can use the brush-on kind or the spray-on kind. If you are using spray-on primer, make sure that you work in a well-ventilated area, preferably outside.

If you are using a storage unit, you will need to remove any hardware. This includes things like hinges and knobs., You can use brush-on acrylic paint, or you can use spray paint. Once again, if you plan on using spray paint, be sure to work in a well-ventilated area so that you don't get a headache. You may need two coats of paint; if you decide to do this, let the first coat dry for 15 to 20 minutes.How long the paint takes to dry will depend on the type of paint you are using. Most acrylic paints take about 20 minutes to dry. Some paints also have a curing time, so be sure to read the label on your paint can carefully.

, There are lots of ways you can spice up your dog's raised bowl, from decoupaging paper onto it to painting designs. Adding a design is not completely necessary, but it can make your dog's raised bowl look much nicer. Here are some ideas to get you started:









Paint on some designs using acrylic paint and stencils.
Stamp on designs using acrylic paint and painting stamps. You can also use a round pouncer for a polka-dot design.
Use stencils, acrylic paint, and a foam brush to paint on words, shapes, or designs onto the box.
Use Mod Podge to glue on some patterned paper to the top of your box. Cut the hole out again, then add another layer of Mod Podge over it when you are done., You can use the brush-on kind, but the spray-on kind will give you a much smoother finish. Choose a waterproof, acrylic sealer for extra durability. Once you have the sealer on, wait for it to dry completely; this could take a few hours.









If you removed any hardware from your base, wait until the sealer has dried and/or cured before putting it back on.Some sealers also have a curing time. While they may be dry to the touch in a few hours, they may not be completely dry for a few days.

, If you made several holes for different bowls, you can fill each bowl with something different: canned food, kibble, and water. If you used a crate or storage unit for your dog's raised bowl, you could use it to store your dog's food.

Increase the percentage of new food over the course of a week.",How to Put Your Dog on a Limited Ingredient Diet," If your dog is having health issues, it's best to consult with a veterinarian about possible causes. In the case of skin irritation, your veterinarian can rule out causes other than diet before you begin an elimination diet., The purpose of a limited ingredient diet is to eliminate allergens from your dog’s diet.Look at the ingredients of your dog's current food and any food that it has previously eaten. All of the ingredients in these foods need to be avoided.


If you no longer have the packaging of a food you previously fed to your dog, you can look the ingredients up online. Most large dog food companies have their ingredient lists posted online.

, Go to your local pet store and look at all of the limited ingredient diet options. Most limited ingredient diets consist of only two ingredients, a protein and a carbohydrate. These are usually unusual proteins and carbohydrates, so it is likely that your dog has not eaten them before.


In addition, most limited ingredient diets are grain free, keeping out common allergens including wheat, corn, and soy.Some common proteins in limited ingredient diets include duck, turkey, lamb, , In order to get to the bottom of a food allergy issue, you need to eliminate all possible allergens from your dog's diet. This means keeping it away from all foods it has previously eaten.Do not give your dog treats or even oral medications, unless directed to do so by your vet, while you are feeding an elimination diet. The goal is to be strict about your dog's eating to that you can find the source of the problem.

, Once your dog's health issues have cleared up, meaning your dog’s irritated skin or digestive problems have gone away, you will want to reintroduce the previous food to verify that it was the cause of the problem. If the health problems resurface, then you know that the cause of the problems was the initial food you were feeding your dog.Do not expect skin problems or digestive issues to clear up quickly. It may take 8 to 12 weeks on a limited ingredient diet to clear up all of your pet's health problems.

, If you want to know what exactly your dog is allergic to, not just that it was generally allergic to its previous food, then you need to do some additional testing. While still feeding a limited ingredient diet, you will need to add the individual ingredients of the dog's previous food back into its diet to find the culprit. Each ingredient is given to the dog for several weeks so that its possible effects can be seen.Dogs are usually allergic to common proteins such as beef, chicken, eggs, and to common grains, such as wheat, corn, and soy. You should start your testing with these ingredients.
Many dog owners do not do this kind of specific testing, instead opting to simply avoid the specific dog food that was making their dog sick.

, Many dog owners decide to keep their dogs on a limited ingredient diet indefinitely after they find that it clears up their dog's allergies. However, it is important to discuss this with a veterinarian so that you are sure that the limited ingredient diet fulfills all of your dog's dietary needs.

, It is important for a dog's digestive health to gradually introduce new food. If you were to switch a dog's food completely in just one meal, your dog would have a very hard time digesting it and it could make your dog very, very ill.Bacteria in your dog's digestive system help to digest its food. With a sudden change in diet, the existing bacteria may not be able to digest the new food, causing an upset stomach and other digestive problems.

, This should be the mix you use for the first couple days. Having only a small amount of the new food in your dog's diet will allow its system to gradually adjust to the new ingredients.It can be tempting to switch a dog's diet over completely if you have run out of its old food and don't want to buy any more. However, it is worth buying a small bag of the dog's old diet just to assure that it does not have adverse reactions to a sudden change.

, After a couple days of a one to three ratio of new food to old food, increase the amount of new food so that you are feeding your dog half and half new and old food. Feed this amount for several days.Then increase the amount of new food for a few day once again, so that you are feeding three parts new food and one part old food.
Finally, you can switch entirely to the new food after a week of gradual introduction.

You need to offer enough variety that your dog gets the nutrients she needs. You may provide too little or too much fat. All of these actions can lead to health problems with your dog.Additionally, you can cause problems if your food is infected with bacteria such as Salmonella or Listeria monocytogenes. Raw foods are more likely to contain these bacteria than dry or canned dog foods.However, some raw dog food followers note that a dog's digestive system is more adept at dealing with these bacteria, as it is not as long and more acidic than ours.;
, Your veterinarian can help you find the right balance, as well as help you assess whether your dog is a good candidate for this diet.For instance, most veterinarians would not recommend a homemade raw diet for puppies, as it can be difficult to get the balance of calcium and phosphorus correct. This problem can lead to bone deformities in puppies. Also, dogs with cancer should not be on this diet., Different dogs need different amounts of protein, and by reading up on the amount of protein your dog needs, you'll be less likely to cause nutrition problems.For instance, puppies who are 12 pounds (and who will eventually be about 33 pounds) need 56 grams of protein and a maximum of 21 grams of fat per day, while dogs who are about 33 pounds need 25 grams of protein and 14 grams of fat per day.Pregnant and nursing dogs need more, however: a pregnant or nursing dog needs 69 grams of protein and 29 grams of fat per day, if she is about 33 pounds with six puppies., Most dogs need about 2 to 3 percent of their weight per day--that is, 2 to 3 percent of the weight they should be for their breed. Therefore, a 30 pound dog needs 0.6 to 0.9 pounds of food per day., Research the amount of protein and fat in the food you are providing. You need to understand the nutritional make-up of the foods you are feeding your dog to make sure you are balancing his diet correctly.


For instance, 100 grams of chicken (about 3 ounces) has 31 grams of protein and 4 grams of fat., Meat is high in phosphorous, while bones are the opposite. Other types of raw foods have a balance, such as fish and eggs. Tripe is also a good source of both.This ratio doesn't mean your dog's diet needs to be 50 percent bone. Rather, it means that the amount of calcium your dog is getting should be roughly the same as the amount of phosphorous he's getting, usually about 10 percent bone to 90 percent meat., The best way to know what you're feeding your dog is to measure it out. If you try to eyeball it, what you feed your dog could vary vastly everyday.

, Tripe and chicken feet may sound gross to you, but your dog doesn't think the same way. To him, meat is meat. Plus, these cuts of meat are often cheaper to obtain. You can also try beef trachea, tails, and testicles. Beef and chicken feet are especially nutritious. , The majority of what you give your dog should be muscle meat, equal to about 3/4 of her diet. Muscle meats can be from most animals, from cows to chickens to lamb.You can also try other meats, such as duck, moose, deer, turkey, rabbit, and goat., Dogs can and will chew up bones, providing necessary calcium to their diet. Your dog should be getting about 10 percent of his diet from bone.In place of bone, you can use dried, ground eggshells. Pour 1/2 teaspoon in for every pound of meat you feed your dog.When feeding your dog bones, you can use what's known as ""raw, meaty bones,"" or bones that still have some meat on them., Organ meats such as liver are fine to feed your dog, and in fact, provide essential nutrients. However, they should only make up about 10 to 15 percent of your dog's diet. Try feeding it for a meal once or twice a week, or adding a few bits of it to your dogs meals several times a week.Liver by itself should be about 5 percent of your dog's diet, while other organs, such as heart, kidney, spleen, and gizzards should make up the other 5 to 10 percent., The other 5 percent or so of your dog's diet can come from other sources, including vegetables, fruits, and grains. When feeding grains, you should cook before you give them to your dog.If the meat your feeding your dog is corn-feed rather than grass-fed, you may need to add a flax seed oil or fish oil supplement to provide omega-3 fatty acids. You can also try feeding fatty fish twice a week to help counter this problem.You should process vegetables before feeding them to your dog to help her get the most nutrients from them. Try pureeing them or juicing them to help break down nutrients. Alternatively, you can steam the vegetables for a few minutes. Dark, leafy greens are a good choice., Some meats need to be frozen for a specific time period before you feed them to your dog. This process helps kill parasites that could harm your dog.Pork and salmon should be frozen for at least 3 weeks prior to you giving them to your dog.However, some experts recommend never feeding salmon or trout raw., The safest place to thaw meat is in the refrigerator, as it never leaves meat at an unsafe temperature. Be sure to place something under the package to catch any spills., It may be tempting to try to rid your meat of bacteria by washing it, but all that really does is spread the bacteria around. While washing it, you can splash it on the counter tops and around the sink, doing more harm than good., Keep all of the utensils you use for preparing raw foods separate from others in your kitchen. Wash them thoroughly in hot water and soap after using them, or put them in the dishwasher. Also, be sure to use disinfectant on any surface that came into contact with the raw food., You should never feed your dog the following fruits and vegetables: onions, corn on the cob, any fruits with pits, avocado pits, hops, raisins, or grapes. You should also not give your dog walnuts, macadamia nuts, raw dough, alcohol, or chocolate., When giving your dog bones, stick to raw bones. Cooked bones can splinter, causing problems for your dog., In other words, don't feed bones such as a cow's femur to your dog because they can break teeth and cause digestion problems., If your dog doesn't finish all of her food, cover it, and put in the refrigerator after she is done to preserve it., You should wash your hands thoroughly after handling any kind of dog food but especially after preparing raw dog food.Scrub your hands in warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds after handling dog food. Be sure to get under your nails, as well."

, A raised food bowl is a bowl that's raised slightly above the ground. This prevents your dog from feeling strained from leaning its head down to eat. Remember, arthritis greatly limits your dog's mobility, so the less it has to move, the better.If you can't find a raised food bowl, try setting a regular food bowl on a small coffee table or cardboard box that's on your dog's level.

, If you feed your dog in the kitchen, there's a risk of your dog slipping on linoleum or tile floors. Dogs can also slip on hardwood floors. A slip or a fall can cause an arthritic dog great discomfort. To help reduce this risk, put down runners or rugs in areas where your dog eats.You can also feed your dog on a carpeted floor, but this can get messy if your dog is a sloppy eater.

, Cold and wet environments can trigger joint pain. It's a good idea to feed an arthritic dog in an area of your home that's dry and warm. Avoid areas near doors or windows, as these can cause drafts., If a dog has arthritis, this can affect your dog's weight. Due to decreased mobility, many arthritic dogs become overweight. You should make an appointment with your veterinarian if you're concerned your dog's weight is becoming an issue.Your veterinarian can weigh your dog and let you know if your dog is a healthy weight for its height and breed.
If your dog is at a good weight, your vet can recommend a feeding and exercise routine to maintain your dog's weight. If your dog needs to lose weight, your vet can help you figure out how to safely get your dog down to a healthy weight.

, It's important to keep your dog physically active. This helps your dog maintain a good weight. However, you do not want to push an arthritic dog too hard. This can worsen the symptoms of arthritis.Dogs, especially younger dogs, will often want to keep playing even if they are feeling pain. It's important you watch for subtle signs of pain, like light limping, and discourage your dog from playing when its arthritis flares up.
Pay attention to how your dog responds to different types of exercises. If certain activities tend to make your dog slow down or limp, you will want to opt for different types of exercises.
Arthritis is a progressive disease. Younger dogs will be able to tolerate more exercise than older dogs. As your dog ages, it will naturally slow down. Adjust the amount of exercise as your dog ages.

, Things like walking and swimming are better for arthritic dogs. High impact activities, like running, can worsen symptoms. Stick to a light daily walk over a daily jog, for example, to keep your dog comfortable and happy.Aim for about 15 to 20 minutes of exercise a day., If your dog is overweight, a diet is usually necessary. This should be used in conjunction with an exercise routine. Arthritic pain will lessen greatly if you get your dog down to a healthy weight. This can keep your dog healthy while eating and engaging in other activities.Always consult a vet before putting a dog on a diet. You want to make sure you're not restricting your dog's food intake to an unhealthy degree. Your vet may also be able to recommend diet-friendly dog food that's safe for a dog with arthritis.

, Omega-3 fatty acids can help reduce inflammation and prevent cartilage damage associated with arthritis. You should seek a dog food that's rich in omega-3 acids to help your dog feel more comfortable. Talk to your vet about the right kind of diet for your dog.Many dog foods are enhanced with omega-3 acids. The omega-3 acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is particularly helpful in treating dogs with arthritis, so ask your vet about a dog food rich in EPA.

, Many owners supplement their dog's diet with These supplements contain vitamins and minerals believed to help ease joint pain and slow the symptoms of arthritis. Talk to your vet if you want to add supplements to your dog's diet.Your vet will want to make sure that supplements are safe for your dog's age, health, and breed. They may want to run blood work before recommending supplements.
While many supplements can be purchased without a prescription, never put your dog on supplements without consulting a vet first. Supplements could interfered with existing medication and may not be safe for all dogs.

, If your dog is still uncomfortable, it main need prescription medication for its arthritis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most common medications, but your vet may also try meds like Rimadyl and Metacam.All medications come with side effects, and a dog on arthritis medication should be safely monitored for side effects.
It can take awhile to find a safe combination of medications for your dog. Your vet will want to see your dog regularly when your dog is first taking meds. You may have to pay for frequent exams and blood work.

Evaluate your dog's personal daily needs.,
Examine different dog food labels.,
You don't need to ask your vet for a recommended brand.,
Sign up for free trials.,
Make notes of your dog's reaction to each new food that they try.If they have been feed a cheap brand before there may be some reluctance to try a new one as it doesn't have the addictive chemicals to make them want to eat it.",How to Pick the Best Dog Food," Every dog is unique, and needs different things from their food. Some questions to consider are:


Are they a large breed or small breed? If they are a small breed they may not be able to bite into the larger kibble like others. Large breeds should stay away from high protein as it can speed up their growth which is very bad for them.
Do they have a specific health issue that requires specialized nutritional needs? Those that have allergies should stay away from any food with grains or corn as these are the top allergy causes.
What is their energy level and do they have responsibilities that require them to expend a lot of calories and energies?;
,


Look for the list of ingredients first. They are listed from largest to smallest amount, according to the ingredients weight. The first 5 ingredients should be meat. Not corn, rice, brewers rice, potatoes or wheat. Make sure they name the meat such as chicken instead of poultry meal
Locate the dog food guaranteed analysis statement. This will give you precise information on the ingredients in the dog food and the percentages on the amounts of the ingredients. This is important because it is a much more accurate version of the nutritional ingredient value of the dog food and will help you in determining if this is the best dog food brand for your dog.
Leave certain ingredients out. Unnecessary ingredients such as corn, wheat, chemicals, fillers and preservatives add nothing to your dogs nutritional needs and can actually harm them.
Check to see if it's a commercial dog food that it has been approved by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). They have their own set of standards for quality and nutrition above and beyond the FDA. This applies to the US only.

, Your vet is not a nutritionist. They are usually only give 13 hours on different dog foods and even that is paid by high brand names that may not be healthy for your dog. A very biased opinion don't you think?

, Once you have read through the labels and are familiar with what ingredients to look for, sign up for a few free trials of dog food samples online. This way you can sample the food before you purchase a full bag.

, Remember not to introduce more than one new food at a time and to slowly increase the new food to the old food so as to avoid diarrhea and vomiting. Some things to watch for:


Do they eat the whole bowl or just a few pieces?
Do they get sick afterward?
Does their stool change consistency?
Is there any change in their skin or coat? A good food should case the coat to become glossy, smooth and soft.

Have your dog examined for a food allergy.,
Consider an elimination diet.,
Choose a food sensitivity diet to try.,
Work with the veterinarian to create a balanced diet.,
Prepare to make your dog's food.,

Mix in oil and cook.,
Add vegetables and carbohydrates.,
Portion the food and give supplements.",How to Make Allergy Food for Dogs," If you notice your dog scratching his irritated or sensitive skin, or if his ears and skin are greasy and smelly, take your dog to the vet. The veterinarian will check for causes of itchiness and irritation, such as parasites, and may suggest testing for environmental allergens or putting the dog on a trial elimination diet.Allergies are usually caused by the proteins in your dog's food, although common causes are beef, chicken, dairy, wheat, corn and soy.These also happen to be the most common ingredients that make up commercial dog foods.


Preservatives and filler ingredients can also irritate your dog's digestion.;
, Since so many ingredients, fillers, and preservatives make up commercial dog food, the vet will probably recommend a food elimination trial. To do this, you'll choose a food sensitivity diet to exclusively feed your dog.Avoid feeding any foods that aren't part of the chosen diet. This will help you determine what substance is bothering your dog.


Remember not to feed treats or rawhide bones during the elimination diet. While this may seem harsh, it will take up to six weeks for your dog's body to “clear” the offending allergens from the body. Any other food during this time could potentially cause the diet to fail.

, When you're ready to closely monitor a strict diet for your dog, you'll need to select a food sensitivity diet. This way, you know exactly what your dog is eating. After several weeks, you should notice an improvement in your dog's allergies or you may realize that something in that particular diet is causing the problem. Some food sensitivity diets to try include:


Novel protein: With this diet, you'll choose a single source of a non-typical meat that your dog has never had before. This might include salmon, venison, buffalo, or duck. Since your dog hasn't been exposed to the protein, there's less of a chance that he's developed an allergy to it.
Hydrolyzed protein: This diet is made up of proteins that are broken down into small component amino acids (which make up the protein). Since they're so small, your dog's body shouldn't notice the protein, preventing an allergic reaction.Therapeutic: These diets which use a novel or hydrolyzed protein are made with higher levels of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids which can reduce the symptoms of food allergies., Once you and your veterinarian have determined the cause of your dog's allergies, choose a nutritious diet. The vet may recommend purchasing a specific commercial product or may prescribe a detailed diet for you to make for your dog. If you do decide to make your own food, you'll need to consult a certified nutritionist or dietitian who has spoken to your vet about your dog's dietary needs.A specialized diet is important for your dog since dogs have different mineral and vitamin requirements than humans. Most dogs do well on a diet made up of 40 percent meat, 50 percent vegetables and 10 percent carbohydrates.

, Once you have a rough idea of the diet your veterinarian and nutritionist recommend, decide if you'd like to make a cooked or raw diet. This is a matter of personal preference, although dogs with certain medical conditions like an overactive immune system or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) should probably avoid a raw allergy diet.Regardless of whether you choose to prepare a cooked or raw food, buy the best quality ingredients you can afford. Once you decide on a novel protein and carbohydrate, you need to stick with that meat and not give any other.

, Wash your hands before handling the food and chop the meat into small pieces suitable for the size of your dog. If cooking, place the meat in a large cooking pot. To make a large batch, choose 4 pounds (1.81 kg) of a protein like:


Venison
Bison
Duck
Ostrich
Turkey

, If cooking your dog's food, stir 1/2 cup (120 ml) of olive oil to the pot with the meat. Cook the mixture until the meat is almost completely cooked through.

, If feeding your dog a raw diet, make sure the vegetables and carbohydrates you choose are cut small enough and are soft enough for you dog to eat without requiring cooking. If you're cooking the food, add 5 pounds (2.27 kg) of vegetables and 1 pound (0.45 kg) of carbohydrates. The vegetables can be fresh or frozen, but try to include a mix of at least two vegetables. Cook the meat, vegetable, and carbohydrate mixture until completely cooked. Some good vegetables and carbohydrates include:Vegetables:

Broccoli
Carrots
Green beans
Celery
Spinach
Squash


Carbohydrates:

Sweet potato
Lima beans
Apples
Peas
Lentils
Garbanzo beans



, If cooked, let the food cool before mixing in any recommended nutritional supplements. Mix it well and divide the food into individual servings before freezing them. If giving a supplement, you can also give the recommended amount to the top of your dog's food just before serving it.


Your veterinarian may recommend a complete dog vitamin that includes all the vitamins and minerals your dog needs. Other supplements include probiotics and omega fatty acids."

Transition the food.",How to Put Your Puppy on a Healthy Feeding Schedule," Before you make any major changes to your puppy’s feeding routine, it is important to consult your vet. Bring your puppy in for a wellness visit to allow your vet to assess your dog’s current health and its overall needs.Ask your vet specific questions like, “Should I put my puppy on a specific type of dog food?” and “How many times a day do I need to feed my puppy? How much should they eat each feeding?”
If you have concerns about your puppy’s weight, whether you believe they need to gain or lose weight, always consult your vet about the best method to implement a weight change program.;
, Your dog’s age and size play an important role in determining their feeding schedule. Puppies under five months should generally be fed in smaller portions three times a day, while older puppies can be fed slightly larger portions twice a day.Your dog’s size, generally determined by weight, lets you know how much you should be feeding your pet. For example, a toy breed like a Pomeranian might only eat 3/4 of a cup of food a day, while a large breed such as a German Shepard can eat up to 2 cups.
Since calorie count varies between brands of dog food, it’s best to consult your vet or the food manufacturer’s recommendations to determine how much your dog should eat every day.

, An important part of creating a feeding schedule for your dog is picking food that will give them the nutrients they need between feedings. Look for foods that minimize fillers such as corn and that have a high ratio of proteins such as beef or chicken.Puppies have different nutritional needs than adult dogs. Look for foods formulated specifically for puppies to ensure that your puppy has their nutritional needs met.
Keep your dog on puppy food until they are at least one year old. Consult your vet before transitioning them from puppy food to adult dog food.

, Remember that while you are feeding your dog at certain pre-determined times, clean, fresh water should be made available to them all day. Place the water bowl somewhere accessible and refill it whenever it is empty.


Clean the water dish with soap and hot water every day to two days to keep the water clean and drinkable for your dog.

, Creating a healthy eating routine for your puppy is most readily done when you establish a consistent schedule. While some variation is inevitable, try your best to find consistent times each day when you can feed your dog.Make sure you feed your puppy during times when you can consistently monitor them. Do not, for example, place food down and then immediately leave for work, as you will not be able to monitor your dog’s food intake.
Try to avoid feeding your dog right before bed or nap time. The ideal time to feed your puppy is generally when you eat breakfast and dinner, or immediately thereafter.

, When feeding time comes, fill the food dish with fresh dog food and put it down for your dog. Leave the food down for an hour or so and see how much your dog eats. This can help you adjust your portions accordingly.For very young puppies who are just past weaning, it is ok to leave the dry food down for them to pick at intermittently.
Remember that manufacturer portion sizes are suggestions. If you notice your dog eating a little less or craving a little more than what the package recommends, adjust your portions to fit.
If your dog is eating substantially less or craving much more than the recommended serving, consult your vet as soon as possible for recommendations to adjust their feeding.

, Part of keeping your puppy on a healthy eating schedule is planning out treats and excess calories accordingly. Plan to give food-based treats sparingly between feedings for specific behaviors or occasions, such as during obedience training.The number of treats you can reasonably give depends upon the nutritional value of each treat. In general, treats should account for no more than ten percent of your puppy's’ caloric intake.
Supplement food-based treats with other rewards such as positive physical and verbal reinforcement.

, If you have previously allowed your dogs to free-feed, you might find that they make noise or beg in between feedings. Consult your vet to make sure your dogs are getting enough food, and if they are, ignore their pleading. It may take time, but eventually they will adjust to the new schedule.


Watch your dogs to make sure they are still healthy and active. If they appear to be lethargic, they may be letting you know they need more food.

, Most puppies should transition to an adult dog food and feeding routine when they are between one and two. However, it is important to talk to your vet and make sure your puppy is healthy and developmentally on track before transitioning food.Take your puppy in for a wellness check at one year and ask your vet, “Is my puppy ready to transition to adult dog food?”
Work with your vet to establish a timeframe and method for transitioning the food.

, If your puppy is still on a three meal feeding routine when you are getting ready to transition them to adult food, start by adjusting them to a two meal a day routine. Feed your puppy the same overall amount of food, but divided between one morning and one evening meal, rather than three meals.Scheduling an afternoon treat may help your dog with the transition in the beginning, as does leaving the morning food bowl down for a bit longer if your dog does not eat the whole thing.

, Transition your puppy to a nutrient-rich adult food gradually. Start by mixing one part adult food and three parts puppy food to get your puppy acclimated. Then, transition one part at a time every two to three days until your puppy is eating a full bowl of adult food.Expect that even a gradual transition may cause your puppy gastrointestinal distress. Be prepared for more frequent bathroom breaks or make training pads available.

Take your Maltipoo for regular veterinary check-ups.,
Request tests to watch for breed-specific diseases.,
Groom your Maltipoo.,
Keep your Maltipoo indoors.,
Get a collar and an ID tag for your Maltipoo.,
Teach kids how to handle your Maltipoo.",How to Care for Maltipoos1," As soon as you get your Maltipoo, you will need to make an appointment with your veterinarian. Your veterinarian will need to examine your Maltipoo to ensure that he is healthy and give him a variety of vaccines and preventative medicines. Some of the things that your Maltipoo will need include:


Lyme disease vaccination
Rabies vaccination
Heartworm prevention medicine
Flea and tick prevention medicine
Spay or neuter operationAnnual exams and vaccination boosters;
, Some diseases are more common in Maltipoos than in other dogs. You will need to check with your veterinarian to determine what tests your Maltipoo should have each year at his or her annual check-up to screen for these diseases. Maltipoos are more prone to:Dental problems due to their small mouth
Hypoglycemia or low blood sugar
Patellar (kneecap) luxation
Collapsing trachea
Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease
White shaker dog syndrome

, Since Maltipoos come from parent breeds that require regular grooming, your Maltipoo will also need regular grooming to maintain a healthy coat and to avoid matting and infections. Your Maltipoo will require a visit to the groomer about once every four to six weeks for a trim, so be prepared for this expense. Your Maltipoo’s grooming needs will also include daily brushing, bathing, checking ears, trimming nails, and cleaning teeth.Brush your Maltipoo’s coat every day. Use swift, firm strokes to brush your Maltipoo’s sides, stomach, back, and chest. Check for fleas, ticks, scabs, lumps, and other skin conditions as you brush. Tell your dog’s veterinarian about anything unusual that you find. Be aware that if your Maltipoo has curlier fur (similar to a poodle) then she will need even more attention to avoid matting.

Bathe your Maltipoo once per month. You can take your Maltipoo to a groomer for a bath or do it yourself.

Clean your Maltipoo’s ears. Look for any wax buildup, discharge, or foul odors. You can clean out your Maltipoo’s ears with a small piece of damp (not wet) cotton gauze wrapped around your finger.

Clip your Maltipoo’s nails once per month. Use a guillotine style trimmer or a grinder to trim your Maltipoo’s nails. Just be careful not to hit the quick, which is a sensitive blood vessel inside of your Maltipoo’s nail. Trim only a little at a time to avoid the quick.

Clean your Maltipoo’s teeth daily. You will need to use a dog toothbrush and toothpaste meant for dogs. Human toothpaste will make your dog sick. Start by letting your Maltipoo lick some wet dog food off of the toothbrush a few times and then try brushing your dog’s teeth.

, Maltipoos are indoor dogs. Keeping your Maltipoo outside will expose her to the elements, predators, and dog thieves. Since Maltipoos are designer dogs that often cost a lot of money, an unattended Maltipoo can be an attractive target for dog thieves.


Make sure that you keep your Maltipoo indoors as much as possible and supervise her whenever she needs to go out.
Give your Maltipoo a soft, comfortable bed to sleep in. To make your maltipoo even more comfortable, you may want to provide a soft bed for your dog. You can purchase a special dog bed or use some old (but clean) blankets.

, If your Maltipoo should ever get out of the yard and wander away from home, a collar and ID tag can help someone to return her home safely to you. Make sure that your Maltipoo is wearing a collar and ID tag at all times.


You may even want to have your Maltipoo implanted with a microchip to ensure that she can be identified even if she gets lost.'

, Maltipoos make excellent family pets because they are so even tempered. However, since Maltipoos are such small dogs, they may end up getting mishandled by young children who do not know any better.If you have kids, make sure that you talk to them about how to be gentle with your Maltipoo to avoid hurting him.


Supervise children around your Maltipoo until you are sure that they know how to handle him with care. If you notice that your child is being too rough with your Maltipoo, then try demonstrating the right way to hold, pet, and play with your Maltipoo. Make sure that you explain why it is important to hold the dog in this way.

Prevent your Maltipoo from eating toxic human foods.,
Provide your Maltipoo with plenty of clean, fresh water.",How to Care for Maltipoos2," Maltipoos require a high-quality food to stay healthy. It is also important to choose a food that is appropriate for small breed dogs because food for larger breeds may be difficult for your Maltipoo to chew.


You can check the ingredients to be sure that the food is high-quality. If meat (not a meat by-product) is one of the first two ingredients, then that dog food is probably high-quality. If not, then look some more.
Consult a pet nutrition expert if you plan to make your dog’s food. Dogs have specific nutritional needs that are different from what humans require and it can be hard to meet these needs when making your dog’s food yourself.Talk to your veterinarian for advice if you want to cook your dog’s food yourself.

, Your Maltipoo’s diet depends on his weight and activity level. You can find a suggested range on your dog’s food package, but you will also need to take your dog’s activity level into account when determining how much to feed your Maltipoo.


For example, your dog’s food package might recommend ½ to one cup of food per day. If your Maltipoo is very active, then he will probably need the higher amount of one full cup of food each day. If your Maltipoo is not active, then he may only need ½ of a cup of food each day.

, Free-feeding is when you leave out a large amount of dry food and allow your dog to eat what he wants whenever he feels like it. This method of feeding is convenient, but it can also cause your dog to become overweight or obese. That is why it is better to give your Maltipoo measured portions at specific times each day.Most adult dogs do best if fed twice per day, so you can divide your dog’s total daily intake into two portions and give one in the morning and the other in the evening.
To determine how much to feed your Maltipoo at each meal, you will need to divide his total daily food intake in half. For example, if your Maltipoo is supposed to have one cup of food every day, then you could give ½ cup in the morning and a ½ cup in the evening.

, Adult dogs do well with two meals per day, but your dog may need to be fed more than twice per day if he is still a puppy. If your puppy is:


eight to 12 weeks, then divide his food into four portions
three to six months, then divide his food into three portions
six months to one year old, then divide his food into two portions, Treats are a nice way to reward your dog for being good, but the calories can add up and lead to weight gain. To prevent your dog from taking in too many excess calories, try offering:


blueberries
watermelon chunks
banana slices
cooked sweet potato slices
broccoli
baby carrots
cooked green beans, Maltipoos can also get sick from some foods, so it is important to monitor your Maltipoo’s diet as well. Foods that you should never give your Maltipoo include:caffeine
onions, garlic, and chives
avocados
chocolate
grapes and raisins
nuts
alcohol
yeast
xylitol, Like all dogs, Maltipoos need to have access to a bowl of clean, fresh water at all times.Ceramic or stainless steel bowls are ideal because they do not hold onto as much bacteria as plastic and your Maltipoo cannot chew on them.


Make sure that you change your Maltipoo’s water every day and replenish it often.

"
"
Train your Maltipoo to go to the bathroom outside.,
Teach your Maltipoo some basic commands.,
Socialize your Maltipoo early.,
Play with your Maltipoo daily.",How to Care for Maltipoos3," House training your Maltipoo is one of the most important and also the most difficult things that you will need to do when you first get her. House training involves developing a regular toileting schedule for your dog, cleaning up when your dog has an accident, and praising your dog when she goes to the bathroom outside.


Try placing some puppy pads or newspaper in a few places around the house in case your Maltipoo has an emergency and you are not around.
Make sure that you take your dog out after he eats as well as a few more times in between. If you are often gone for long periods, then consider having a neighbor or friend stop by to let your dog out.
Never yell at your dog, hit your dog, or rub your dog’s face in urine or feces. These methods of house training do not work and they will only frighten and confuse your dog.You may also want to consider crate training your Maltipoo. Crate training can help with housetraining and it is also a good way to teach your Maltipoo not to chew on furniture, shoes, and other off-limits items.

, Training your dog is an excellent way to make sure that he is well-behaved and that he listens to you. Training is also a great way to provide some mental stimulation for your dog and it can even serve as a bonding activity. Some good basic commands to teach your Maltipoo include:


Sit
Stay
Speak
Down
Heel

, It is important to socialize your Maltipoo so that she will be calm in all sorts of different situations. After your Maltipoo’s first round of vaccinations at about eight weeks old, you can start to socialize her.


Be sure to expose your Maltipoo to people of all ages genders, races, and sizes, other dogs, cats, people dressed in unusual attire (hats, raincoats, boots, etc.), loud noises, crowds, and vehicles.
Always keep your Maltipoo on a leash when you take her out in public.
Give your Maltipoo lots of praise and petting for being curious and calm around new people and situations.
If your Maltipoo gets scared, try to reassure her as much as you can or remove her from the situation if she becomes too nervous (trembling, barking, hiding, etc.)

, Your Maltipoo needs lots of love, attention, and affection. You can provide her with these things by remembering to take time to play with your Maltipoo every day. Try heading out in the back yard for a game of fetch each day or take your Maltipoo with you on a walk around the neighborhood.


Provide fun toys. Maltipoos are smart dogs, so they enjoy toys that will challenge their problem solving skills. Try giving your Maltipoo a variety of interesting toys including puzzle toys, balls, and rope toys.
Pet your Maltipoo. Sometimes your Maltipoo may just want some affection. Make sure that you pet your Maltipoo every day.

Have a backup plan if you run out of food.",How to Prepare Home Cooked Food for Your Dog," Yes, wolves or wild dogs can survive in the wild without balanced meals. But, their average lifespan is considerably shorter. They also eat very differently than your dog is used to. While you might feed your dog pure protein, dogs in the wild eat organs like kidney, liver, brain, and the contents of the guts. This makes for a more complex nutrition than simply feeding meat (protein) and rice (carbohydrate) from the store.If you feed your dog an unbalanced home prepared diet, it can take years for the problems to appear. This is because it's the micro-nutrition (vitamins and minerals) that are probably lacking, instead of the calories.
For example, a dog might do fine for weeks or years, but some time later the dog may get a fractured leg because of long term calcium deficiency in his diet.;
, Unfortunately, you can't simply look at recipes that look tasty. Since there's no ""one size fits all"" option for canine nutrition, you'll need to feed a diet that's been designed for your individual dog by a doctor of animal nutrition.For example, a growing puppy needs up to double the calories per pound of body weight of an adult, while a senior dog needs 20% less than an adult.Basic diets, even those designed by veterinarians, often lack nutrition. A study analyzed 200 recipes created by veterinarians. The majority of the recipes were deficient in at least one key area of nutrition.

, Once you've gotten a recipe specific to your dog, correctly process the food to maintain vitamins and minerals. Always be sure to follow the directions exactly. If the recipe states chicken plus the skin, then that's exactly what it means. Do not remove the skin since this could throw out the fat balance. You should also weigh the ingredients out carefully, using a kitchen scale rather than cups, which could vary.To preserve nutrients, don't over boil veggies. Instead, try to steam and serve them partially raw in order to preserve vitamins.Don't improvise or substitute ingredients. These can throw off the nutritional balance., Dogs have a very high requirement for calcium and while you could give your dog a bone, there are health risks. Bones can splinter, scratching the lining of the bowels and causing painful inflammation and septicaemia (blood infections). Instead, you can add calcium carbonate, calcium citrate, or eggshell crushed into a fine powder. 1 teaspoon is equal to around 2,200mg of calcium carbonate, and a 33 pound adult dog needs 1 gram a day (half a teaspoon).Bones can also knit together within the gut and cause blockages that need surgical removal. It's also very difficult to know when the dog has gotten enough calcium from the bones he does eat.

, A 33 pound adult dog needs a minimum of 25 grams of pure protein a day.This can include egg (which has a high amount of the essential amino acids required by dogs), followed by animal protein, such as meat from chicken, lamb, or turkey. High-quality vegetarian sources, like high-protein pulses, seeds, and eggs, can also supplement the diet. Try to make sure that a minimum 10% of your dog's diet is coming from quality protein (meat).Protein is made up of small building blocks called amino acids. There are 10 amino acids which dogs cannot make for themselves and must be supplied in their diet.

, A 33 pound adult dog (about the size of an average Staffordshire bull terrier) needs at least 14 grams of fat a day.You can make sure your dog is getting fat in his diet by including meat or feeding chicken skin. It's recommended that a minimum 5% of your dog's diet comes from fats (by weight).Fat contains fat-soluble vitamins which are essential for good health. They also play a role in creating new cells proper cell functioning.

, Carbohydrates are where most of your dog's calories should come from. Specifically, half of your dog's diet should come from carbohydrates. An active 30 pound dog needs around 930 calories a day.To make sure he's getting them, include wheat, rice, oats, and barley in his diet.


Carbohydrates provide energy (while some is given from protein and fat). They also give fiber for healthy gut function.

, Dogs need calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, selenium, iron and copper to mention but a few. Mineral deficiencies can lead to a variety of problems, including weak bones prone to fracturing, anemia, or poor nerve conduction which can lead to seizures. Different foods contain varying degrees of minerals, especially fresh vegetables which require careful research to make sure your dog's diet is getting enough of each.Try to include the following high-mineral vegetables in your dog's diet:


Green leafy vegetables (raw or cooked), such as spinach, kale, spring greens, brussel sprouts, Bok choy, and chard
Butternut squash (cooked)
Turnip (cooked)
Parsnip (cooked)
French beans (cooked)
Okra (cooked)

, Vitamins are an important part of your dog's diet. A vitamin deficiency can lead to problems like blindness, poor immune systems, skin lesions, and susceptibility to infections. Since vitamins are found in a varying degrees in several foods, offer a variety of vegetables. Green vegetables are generally a good source of vitamins and minerals, but some dogs don't like the taste and tend to leave them. Green vegetables can be served raw, but be aware there's a risk of the dog becoming flatulent.


Avoid overcooking vegetables since this will destroy the vitamin content.Vegetables that you wouldn't ordinarily eat raw yourself (like turnip, swede, parsnip, or potato for example) should always be cooked to prevent the risk of bowel obstruction and to make them digestible.

, You'll need to research how many calories your dog actually needs to keep him from becoming overweight or losing weight. The calorie requirement for a dog isn't a linear arrangement. For example, a 40 pound dog doesn't need twice as many calories as a 20 pound dog just because he weighs twice as much.You can look up several charts for basic daily calorie requirements for dogs. That will give you a general idea of how many calories your dog needs based on his weight.Once you've found a general guideline for your dog's weight, take into consideration any lifestyle differences that require an adjustment (such as pregnancy, obesity, age of your dog, and whether your dog is neutered or spayed). For example, a 10 pound puppy under 4 months old needs 654 calories while an older neutered 10 pound dog only needs 349., Many people are familiar with the warning that chocolate is harmful to dogs. But, there are several other foods that are fine for people but toxic to dogs. When trying out a new recipe always double check that the ingredients are safe for your dog. Never feed your dog:Raisins
Grapes
Onions (including shallots and chives)
Garlic
Tomato
Chocolate
Avocado
Yeast dough
Caffeine
Alcohol
Artificial sweeteners
Xylitol
Macadamia nuts

, If you're cooking for your dog every 4 to 5 days, you probably won't experience major problems. But, you may occasionally run out of food or have a dog with a stomach ache, which requires a gentler diet. In both these cases, a home-prepared diet of chicken and rice is gentle on the bowels and serves as a short-term solution to when you run out of regular food. Avoid feeding a chicken and rice diet in the long term, since it's lacking in minerals and vitamins.


To prepare chicken and rice, use 1 cup of boiled chicken breast meat mixed with 2 to 3 cups of boiled white rice. Don't add fat or oil to the chicken.
Give a similar volume of food to what you'd normally give; use your judgement.Typically this would be around 1 1/3 cups of chicken and rice per 10 pound body weight.

Look for chicken that is raised without hormones if possible.;
, Avoid quick-cooking rice for this dog food recipe, since this product has lower nutritional value than its long-cooking counterpart.


Brown rice may be used, but it must be cooked longer so that it is fully cooked and soft enough to avoid irritating the dog’s stomach or intestine.
Some sources may say to avoid brown rice because it has too much fiber, but this is a myth. Fiber helps promote and regulate normal bowel function. Veterinary nutritionists believe that fiber shortens intestinal transit rate in dogs with slow transit time and prolongs the rate in dogs with rapid transit time (in other words, it makes constipated dogs poop, but firms the stool in dogs with diarrhea).There is no need to buy organic or non-GMO labeled rice; there has been no evidence to tie these products to change in nutritional quality or arsenic levels in rice.

, Chicken can be cooked bone-in, but the meat must be removed from the bone after cooking. However, the chicken will cook faster and more thoroughly if you de-bone and cut it prior to cooking or purchase boneless chicken.


Cut the chicken off of the bone (or buy boneless chicken) and cut away fat.
Cube chicken into half-inch cubes for small dogs or 1-inch cubes for medium or large breed dogs. Dogs that are missing many teeth may need to have even smaller pieces of food.

, Fill with enough water to cover the chicken. Bring to a boil then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook the chicken until the meat is fully white inside.


The cook time will vary between 10 and 30 minutes, depending on the size of the pieces. Bone-in chicken will need longer.
If the chicken is not fully cooked, your dog could be at risk for increased diarrhea and vomiting due to the bacteria found in raw or under cooked chicken.

, Reserve the broth for later use. You can help the chicken cool more quickly by spreading it out on a baking sheet or by placing it in a colander and running cool water over it.

, Separate the meat and discard the bones. Then cut the chicken into pieces that are a half inch or smaller for small breed dogs or one inch or smaller for medium or large breed dogs.


Be sure that your dog cannot access the chicken bones, either in the chicken pieces or from the trash can. Chicken bones can splinter and become lodged in or puncture your dog’s throat, stomach, or intestines. This could be fatal.

, If you cut the fat off of the chicken prior to cooking, there may be little or no fat to skim off. Measure 2.5 cups (591.47 ml) of the chicken broth and pour it back into the pot.

, While waiting for the broth to boil, you can begin to prepare the rice, which you will cook in the broth.

, and rinse it thoroughly. Rinse the rice in a pan, a rice cooker insert, or in a bowl. Use plenty of water and stir the rice around with your fingers while it is submerged. Rinse several times until the water runs clear; this step helps remove excess starches and arsenic from the rice.

, Once the chicken broth is boiling, pour the cup of rice into the broth. Return to a boil, and then lower the heat to a simmer. Cover with a tightly fitting lid and cook for 20 minutes (brown rice will likely need 40-45 minutes). The rice will be slightly soggy and soft when done, and all of the water should be absorbed.

, The process can be expedited by spreading the rice out on top of a baking pan and fanning it with a sheet of cardboard.

, Your rice to chicken ratio should be between 2:1 and 3:1. For example, 2 to 3 cups of rice should be mixed with 1 cup of chicken.

, Follow your veterinarian’s instructions about feeding the dog, but generally, you would feed a little at a time to a dog that has been vomiting. If your dog holds the food down, give him a bit more the next time, working your way towards a full portion at your dog’s regular meal times.

, After several days of successful chicken and rice food, you can begin to add the dog’s normal kibble into the chicken and rice mix. Add more kibble each day, reducing the amount of chicken and rice, as you gradually transition back to a normal diet over a period of 4-5 days.Be sure to consult your veterinarian about the transition back to normal food. Depending on the dog’s specific condition, you may need to feed the dog a chicken-and-rice diet longer than a few days.

, The chicken and rice diet is meant to be a temporary at-home treatment. If your dog’s diarrhea is not cleared in the expected time frame given to you by your veterinarian, or the diarrhea stays very watery for 3 days or more, call your veterinarian immediately. Your veterinarian will tell you if you need to bring your animal in for a recheck and may send home additional medication or give you some advice over the phone of what to do next, such as adding in canned pumpkin or other easy things to try.

Bake the treats.",How to Make Grain Free Dog Treats1," You make grain free treats by using a flour made from something other than wheat flour. Wheat flour contains gluten, which is stretchy and accounts for many of the properties of grain that make it so popular. Because you are not using wheat flour, don't expect your grain-free treats to rise or expand, the finished treat are likely to be denser than treats containing grain, and they will be more crunchy. For this super easy grain-free treat you will need:3 tablespoons of smooth peanut butter
1 large egg
1 ripe banana, mashed
1¾ cup of garbanzo bean flour;
, Preheat the oven to 300 F. Get out two bowls, a fork, and a cookie sheet. Line the cookie sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.

, In a bowl mash the banana with a fork and then mix it with the peanut butter and egg. Combine until they are completely mixed together.


Put the garbanzo flour in another bowl. Stir the wet ingredients into the flour and combine until it forms a dough.

, Either use a silicone sheet or use more garbanzo flour and roll out the dough until it is ¼ inch thick. Use a knife or use a cookie cutter of your choice to cut out the individual treats.

, Place the treats on baking parchment on a baking tray. You can put them close together, as the treats do not spread while cooking.


Place the tray on the middle shelf of the pre-warmed oven. Cook for 30 - 40 minutes until golden.

Balance and combine the meal.",How to Prepare a Healthy Meal for Your Pet Dog," Ideally, your dog should have a meal plan that's tailored to his or her specific dietary needs. What is nutritionally appropriate for one dog may not be what's best for your dog. This is especially true if you're feeding a growing puppy, instead of an adult dog. Work with a veterinary nutritionist to develop a meal plan for your dog.While your veterinarian may be able to suggest some healthy options for meals, a study that analyzed veterinarian-created recipes found that the majority of recipes lacked at least one key area of nutrition.;
, It's easy to fall into a routine if you regularly prepare food for your dog. If the meal you usually make is missing a certain nutrient, your dog could develop a nutritional deficiency over time. To prevent this, feed your dog a variety of meals over the span of several days.For example, you may feed your dog a mixture of chicken, rice, and vegetables for three or four days. Then, you may feed a meal of grains and seafood for another three or four days. Your dog will get a variety of nutrients over the course of the week.

, Some foods we humans safely eat are actually toxic to dogs. In many cases, your dog would need to eat a large quantity or small amounts regularly before developing health problems, but it's not worth the risk. Monitor your dog for several weeks if you fear he's eaten something he shouldn't. If you are not sure if a food is safe, speak to your veterinarian. You should avoid feeding your dog:Garlic: The more concentrated the garlic is, the more dangerous it is to your dog. Make sure any chicken or vegetable broths you cook with don't contain dried garlic.
Onions in any form (fried, baked, raw, or dried)
Grapes, raisins or sultanas: These cause kidney failure.
Avocado: This has contains persin which dogs can't tolerate. Persin toxicity causes a range of problems, from mild stomach upset to fluid in the chest and breathing difficulties.
Chocolate
Bread dough
Xylitol (artificial sweetener found in low sugar cookies, cakes, and sweets)
Alcohol
Macadamia nuts

, If you're just feeding one homemade meal for your dog, you can skip the supplement. However, if you're planning to regularly feed your dog homemade meals, you'll need to give him a dietary supplement. A supplement will ensure that your dog gets enough calcium, vitamin D, vitamin E, and other essential minerals. You can find calcium supplements at your pet store. Choose one that will give your dog 800 to 1,000 mg of calcium for each pound of food feed.Ask your veterinarian to recommend a vitamin and mineral supplement specific for your dog's needs.

, Meat should make up the majority of your dog's meal. However, meat should not make up more than half of the meal. Choose a lean meat that has the bones and fat removed. Most dogs don't need the extra energy or calories that come from fatty meat. Instead, fatty meat could cause your dog to gain weight (unless he's very active).For example, your dog's meal could be 50% chicken, 25% rice, and 25% vegetables.

, Since half of your dog's meal will come from meat, the other half should be made up of equal parts carbohydrates and vegetables.Carbohydrates can come from cooked rice, pasta, or boiled potato. Good vegetables include cooked:Green leafy vegetables (such as spinach, kale, spring greens, brussel sprouts, Bok choy, and chard)
Butternut squash
Turnip
Parsnip
French beans
Okra

, Fish is a great way to add protein to your dog's meals. It also has high levels of omega fatty acids which are essential for a healthy coat. Fish is also rich in vitamin D which helps your dog convert calcium into strong bones. You can offer your dog a small amount of fish every day or a fish meal twice a week. Add about one ounce of fish for every pound of other meat. Good fish choices include tinned:Tuna
Mackerel
Sardines (packed in water, not oil)
Pink salmon

, Eggs and dairy can provide a variety of nutrients your dog needs such as protein and calcium. Take care not overfeed your dog though. You should typically only feed one egg for every 20 pounds your dog weighs. If your dog weighs less, you'll need to scale this down appropriately. If you decide to give your dog dairy, consider offering cottage cheese or goat's milk.Since not all dogs can digest the lactose in most dairy, watch for upset stomach.

, Depending on how many meals you're making, cook a small amount of rice (for one meal) or a pot of rice that you can use for several meals. Once the rice is completely cooked, set it aside while you prepare the rest of the meal. If using other vegetables as the source of carbohydrates, be sure to cook them well. Good carbohydrates include:Sweet potato
Lima beans
Apples
Peas
Lentils
Garbanzo beans

, Wash your hands and trim the meat of any fat, tendons, skin, or bones. Chop the meat into bites that your dog can manage (larger bites for larger dogs and smaller bites for smaller dogs). Cook the meat in a little bit of oil over medium heat until it's completely cooked.

, Wash your vegetables and chop them into bites that your dog can manage. Saute the vegetables in a pan with oil until they're soft enough for your dog to easily eat. Good sources of vegetables include:Broccoli
Zucchini
Carrots
Green beans
Celery
Spinach
Summer or winter squash

, Once the components of the meal are prepared, combine the appropriate balance. You'll need to mix half of the meat with one-quarter vegetables and one-quarter carbohydrates. Stir the mixture well and portion out enough for your dog's meal. Store the rest in the refrigerator.


For example, mix 1 cup of cooked chicken with 1/2 cup of zucchini and 1/2 cup of cooked rice.

Avoid giving your dog foods that are bad for it.,
Rotate the foods you make for variety and a balanced diet.",How to Make Your Own Dog Food1," Your dog may have specific nutritional needs that your vet can explain to you. Your vet may even have some great suggestions of key ingredients that will help your pet's health.


After you have been feeding a homemade diet to your dog for a couple of weeks take your pet to the veterinarian to make certain it is not gaining or losing weight. If weight loss or gain has occurred discuss the diet with your veterinarian to determine how your feeding should be adjusted.;
, If your veterinarian doesn't know about homemade meals for dogs, consult with an expert in animal nutrition. He or she will help you to construct a homemade diet suitable for your particular dog. This is vital if your dog has any chronic health conditions.


Your local veterinarian can help you locate a nutrition expert in your area or you can find one at http://www.balanceit.com/ or http://www.petdiets.com/.

, For example, puppies need more calorie and nutrient dense foods than adults, as their bodies are rapidly growing and forming their bones and muscles. Elderly dogs require fewer calories than adult dogs, as their metabolism has slowed.


Older dogs still need good quality food with plenty of nutrients. They also need more fiber to keep the food moving through their digestive tract properly.
Pregnant and nursing dogs need more calories to meet the demands of the pregnancy on their bodies.
Small breeds of dogs have a higher metabolism (on average) than do large or giant breeds of dogs. Therefore smaller dogs require a more nutrient and calorie dense food than the big dogs.
There is also a difference in foods fed between small breed puppies and large breed puppies. Large breed puppies are more prone to orthopedic problems and need careful balancing of nutrients such as protein, calcium and phosphorus in order to form their skeletal systems.

, Feeding your dog the wrong foods can make it sick; in some cases it can even cause organ damage to the point your dog could die. Under no circumstances feed these foods to dogs:Alcohol
Avocados
Candy, especially chocolates
Garlic, garlic powder, onions, onion powder
Grapes
Macadamia nuts
Mushrooms
Mustard seeds
Raisins
Salt
Walnuts

Follow an especially healthy recipe.,
Scoop the dough onto parchment paper.,
Never use canned pumpkin pie mix.,
Puree raw pumpkin flesh.,
Try a simple baked pumpkin treat.",How to Make Pumpkin Dog Treats1," The American Kennel Club favors a particular pumpkin dog treat recipe that’s easy to follow and especially healthy for your dog. Before mixing your ingredients, preheat your oven to 350 degrees F (177 degrees C).You’ll need a cup of flour, an egg, half a cup of 100% pure canned pumpkin puree, and a 4-ounce jar each of 100% carrot baby food, and 100% green bean baby food.
After mixing all the ingredients, add a bit more flour if it’s wet and sticky, or a bit more water if it’s not sticking together.
Substitute coconut flour or potato flour if you so desire, but expect your batter to be more crumbly.;
, This recipe will yield about two dozen treats. Use a spoon or spatula to place individual dollops onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. If you want, you can shape them in a way you think your dog might enjoy.Bake the treats for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the edges brown.
Don’t offer any to David Barkie until they’re cool to the touch.

, For this and any other pumpkin treat recipe, take care to avoid using pumpkin pie mix, which will contain additional sugar and spices Make sure whatever you’re using, if canned, is 100% unsweetened pumpkin.A sweetener called xylitol is especially important to watch out for, as it is dangerous to dogs.

, For the freshest flavor, make your own pumpkin puree instead of buying it canned. This homemade puree can be used exactly like the 100% pumpkin puree you can buy from the store. To begin, remove a pumpkin's stem, peel and quarter the pumpkin, and cut the meaty portion into chunks.Boil the chunks of pumpkin flesh in water in a covered sauce pan for about twenty minutes.
Once the pumpkin pieces are tender, drain them and allow them to cool.
Use a food processor of potato masher to puree the pumpkin.
Use the pumpkin immediately, or store it in the fridge or freezer. The puree will last three days in the fridge, and three months or so in the freezer.

, If you don’t want to subject Scruffy to vegetables, there are plenty of recipes that are more neutral. For a twenty treat batch, grab two eggs, half a cup of canned pumpkin puree, half a teaspoon of salt, two tablespoons of dry milk, and two and a half cups of flour.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (177 degrees C) while you blend the eggs, pumpkin, salt, dry milk, and flour together.
Add water until the dough is workable but still somewhat dry and stiff.
Roll the dough into a ½ inch (1.3 cm) thick sheet and cut however you'd like. Space individual treats at least an inch (2.5 cm) apart.
Bake them for 20 minutes, flip them over, and bake them another 20 minutes.

Include peanut butter.,
Make no-bake peanut butter pumpkin treats.,
Craft an extra large batch with banana.",How to Make Pumpkin Dog Treats2," It’s well know that pups particularly favor peanut butter. For a batch of treats your dog will love, gather two and a half cups of whole wheat flour, two eggs, half a cup of canned pumpkin, two tablespoons of peanut butter, and half a teaspoon each of salt and ground cinnamon. Don’t forget to preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).Whisk all the ingredients together, adding water until the dough is workable.
Roll out a sheet as thick as a dime is wide, and cut into small pieces.
Bake until hardened and allow to cool.

, If you want to forego baking, try another peanut butter and pumpkin dog treat recipe that can simply be prepared and served. You’ll need half a cup of peanut butter, a cup or 100% pumpkin puree, a teaspoon of cinnamon, three tablespoons of honey peanut butter, and two and a half cups of oats.Mix all the ingredients except the oats in a bowl. Spread the oats on a plate.
Roll the batter into balls, then roll the balls in the oats.
Store the balls in an airtight container in your fridge. They’ll last for three weeks, or three months in the freezer.

, To make about 40 treats and put an overripe banana to use, gather half a can of pumpkin puree, a tablespoon of honey, one and a half cups of whole wheat flour, and half a teaspoon of baking powder. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).Mix the banana, pumpkin, and honey. Work the flour and baking soda in bit by bit.
The dough should be relatively dry, but add some water if it’s too crumbly.
Roll the dough and cut it into shapes, as desired.
Bake on a parchment papered baking sheet for about ten minutes, or until golden brown.

Prep a batch of multi-species treats.,
Prepare a muffin tin.,
Bake for about fifteen minutes.,
Snack on pumpkin seeds together.",How to Make Pumpkin Dog Treats3," Believe it or not, there is a recipe for pumpkin treats that you’ll love as much as your dog. You’ll need half a cup of canned pumpkin puree, one cup of whole wheat flour, a cup of quick cut oats, a tablespoon of coconut oil, an egg, and a quarter cup of Greek yogurt.In terms of spices to make these more palatable to humans, you’ll also need half a teaspoon of vanilla, one tablespoon of honey, and a teaspoon each of ginger and ground cinnamon.
Pulse or otherwise blend the oats until they’re half powder.

, In addition to preheating the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), you’ll also need to grease a muffin tin to bake your treats in. A mini muffin tin works best, and will yield more treats overall. After mixing all of the ingredients in a large bowl, thin the mixture with water until it’s malleable.Fill individual cups in the tin two-thirds of the way with the batter.

, The muffins are finished when their tops are golden brown. For added aesthetic appeal, feel free to sprinkle oats on top of the muffins right when they come out of the oven.Allow the muffins to cool in the tin. Store your muffins in the fridge for a few weeks, or fin the freezer for up to three months.

, Raw pumpkin seeds are also good for both you and your dog on their own. The seeds’ fatty acids may be especially beneficial for dogs with joint, skin, or coat conditions. Only give your dog one seed at a time, or crush them completely and add them to your dog’s food."

Add remaining ingredients before each meal.",How to Make Homemade Dog Food2," While dogs are naturally omnivorous, it is possible for them to develop sensitivities, allergies, and other stomach troubles. Frequent culprits for doggy food sensitivities include the proteins found in chicken and eggs, beef and dairy, wheat, and soy. In such cases, switching your dog to a vegan or vegetarian diet may be the solution.


Allergy symptoms to look out for include itchy skin, hair and fur loss, ear infections, and frequent vomiting and diarrhea. Consult your veterinarian if your dog is exhibiting any of these signs., When it comes to a boil, add the rice, lentils, and sweet potatoes. Lower the heat enough to reduce the pot to a simmer, and cook until everything is soft, about 40 minutes to an hour.

Provide the necessary vitamins and nutrients.,
Feed your dog a balanced diet.,
Make small changes to the recipes.,
Avoid toxic foods.,
Allow some foods only in moderation.,
Look for the signs of good health.",How to Make Homemade Dog Food4," Making your own dog food has many benefits, but it’s important to make sure your dog gets everything he needs from his food. A proper diet will contain the right balance of protein, fat, carbohydrates, calcium, and essential fatty acids, all of which come from a variety of sources.Protein comes from meat, eggs, seafood, beans, lentils, grains, and legumes.
Fat comes from meat and healthy oils.
Carbohydrates come from grains and vegetables.
Calcium comes from eggshells.
Essential fatty acids can be found in egg yolks, oats, and plant oils such as hemp and flaxseed.

, Your dog’s daily nutritional requirements will depend on several factors, including age, size, activity level, sex, and for females, whether or not she’s pregnant or nursing. In general however, any dog’s diet requires:Between 16 and 24 percent protein.
Between 10 and 32 percent fat.
Between 44 and 32 percent carbohydrates (pregnant females and puppies need a higher percentage of protein and lower percentage of carbohydrates).
Between 20 and 28 percent of their calories from protein.

, Just like humans, dogs get different nutrients from different foods, so they need to eat a variety of foods. This doesn’t mean feeding him a different recipe at every meal (which could upset his stomach), but make slight changes to the recipes you do make. Try adding new ingredients to each batch of food, such as:1/8 cup honey or tahini
500 to 1,000 mg of vitamin C powder
1/4 cup kelp powder
1/4 cup parsley or oregano
1/8 cup turmeric powder

, There’s a long list of foods that dogs shouldn’t have, and while some are acceptable from time to time, others are dangerous and should always be avoided. For a more complete list, check out the humane society’s website. Toxic foods and foods to avoid include:


Onions, garlic, and chives
Salt and sugar
Acidic foods like tomatoes and citrus fruits
Most dairy products
Chocolate
Grapes and raisins
Bread
Coconut
Avocado
Apple seeds

, Some foods are acceptable in a canine diet in small quantities only. Cultured dairy products are one example: while many dogs cannot digest dairy products and lactose, cultured dairy products like yogurt don't contain a lot of lactose, and are safe in moderation.


Bacon and ham are another example, as these foods are excessively fatty and should only be given to your dog in small amounts.Liver should also only be given in moderation, as it contains high amounts of vitamin A, and can cause an overdose., A healthy diet means a healthy dog, and there are signs of good health that you can look for. If you suspect any issues, talk to your vet right away. Signs of good canine health include:Proper weight
Shiny coat
Healthy skin
Appropriate energy levels
Firm, brown stool

, Use your hands to knead the dough until it becomes stiff and pliable. Turn it out onto a floured counter or work surface.

, Use a rolling pin to roll the dough to the thickness you desire. For larger dogs, keep the dough thick, about 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm), and for smaller dogs, roll it thin, about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm).

, Use a bone-shaped cookie cutter to cut the dough into bone shapes. Lay the bones on a greased cookie sheet.


Once you've cut as many bones as you can, gather the dough scraps and roll them into a ball, then use the rolling pin to flatten the dough again. Cut more dog bone shapes from the dough using the cookie cutter.
If you don't have a dog bone-shaped cookie cutter, use another fun shape for your dog's treats. Go for a holiday themed cutter, like a tree or a snowflake, or use a classic shape like a star or a circle.

, Place the cookie sheet in the oven and bake the cookies for 50 minutes. Check them periodically to make sure they don't burn.


If the cookies seem to be turning brown quickly, reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees.

Baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat
Bone-shaped cookie cutter (or any other shapes you desire)
Cooling rack
Rolling pin

, Crack the eggs into the mixture and beat for one to two minutes until fully combined. It’s important to use sugar-free ingredients, because too much sugar in a dog’s diet can lead to the same health issues it would for a human, including obesity and diabetes.To add some different flavors into the cookies, you can:Substitute sweet potato puree for some or all of the pumpkin.
Substitute a quarter of the pumpkin or sweet potato puree with apple sauce.

, Add one-half cup of flour at a time and mix to incorporate. When you have added 2 ½ cups of flour, only add more if the dough is still sticky. Add flour in one-quarter cup increments until the dough isn’t sticky.


For a dog with wheat sensitivities or allergies, try rice, chickpea, oat, quinoa, or amaranth flour. Avoid corn or soy flour, as many dogs cannot properly digest these ingredients either., Sprinkle the flour on the table or countertop space that you cleared and sanitized earlier. Knead the dough for one to two minutes, until it comes together in a ball.

, Place the cookies on the baking sheet. When you run out of dough to punch cookies out of, collect the remaining dough, knead it back into a ball, and roll it out again so you can punch out more cookies. If you don’t have cookie cutters, you can:


Make regular cookies. Take tablespoon-sized balls of dough and flatten them into quarter-inch thick patties.
Mold shapes with your hands. For traditional bone-shaped cookies, roll a tablespoon-sized dough ball into a cylinder. Mold the ends of the cylinder so each end has two protruding ball joints. Flatten the bone so it's about one-quarter inch thick.

, When you don’t have enough dough left to punch out any more shapes, form tablespoon-sized balls of dough into patties.

, When the edges of the cookies are golden brown, remove them from the oven. Place the cookies on a cooling rack and allow to cool before serving to your pup.

,, In the meantime, grab what you’ll need, including your ingredients, one medium mixing bowl, one small mixing bowl, a whisk and large spoon, a greased (or parchment lined) cookie sheet, a rolling pin, cookie cutters, and a cooling rack., In the medium bowl, whisk together the flour, oats, and wheat germ. Use wheat flour or a wheat-free flour of your choice.

, In a small bowl, stir together the tomato paste, applesauce, and broth. You can also use chicken, turkey, or any other sodium-free broth.


Instead of tomato paste, you can use barbecue sauce, but make sure it's sugar-free, salt-free, and doesn’t have any spices that are unsafe for dogs (most spices should be avoided).

, Stir to combine, and continue stirring until the mixture forms into dough.

, You want this dough to be a quarter- to half-inch thick. Cut out your cookies with the cookie cutter shapes of your choice and place them on your greased baking sheet. Re-roll your dough until you can't punch out any more cookies, and form the remaining dough into patties.

, In the bowl, mix the ground beef, cooked rice, carrot, celery, spinach, parsley, egg, and turmeric.Stir until all the ingredients are fully combined.


You can add two tablespoons of cheddar or Parmesan cheese, but be warned that milk products are not recommended for dogs because the lactose they contain can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and gas., For a larger dog, this mixture should make about 10 meatballs. For a smaller dog, make about 15 smaller meatballs. Use your hands to form them into balls and place them on the baking sheet.

, Be sure they are cooked through. Allow to cool completely before serving.

, Sealing away warm food in a container will allow bacteria to flourish, and the condensation that will form can cause mold to grow.

, Some of the best air-tight containers are ones with snapping or locking lids, or ones that are specifically designed to create a seal with the lid and the container. You can also use re-sealable plastic bags.

, The fridge will help preserve any treat for longer, but anything containing meat, meat juice, or dairy must be kept in the fridge. In an air-tight container, treats can last up to two months in the refrigerator., You can make larger batches of dog treats and store the majority in air-tight containers in the freezer for up to eight months!Be sure to thaw them before letting your pup chew on them

Know what nutrients dogs need.,
Decide whether to feed your dog raw or cooked meat.",How to Make Dog Food1," A dogs digestive system is different from the human one and the balance of ingredients in homemade dog food needs to be tailored to the dogs special needs. When you cook for your dog, keep the following in mind:


Dogs are carnivores, so at least half of a dog's diet should be composed of protein, which provides dogs with the nutrients and minerals they need to be strong and healthy.Chicken, turkey, beef, lamb, and fish are all acceptable sources of protein for a dog. Dogs can also be fed eggs and vegetables that contain protein.
Organ meat, such as liver and kidney, should only be given to your dog a few times a week.Dogs may also eat grains, root and green vegetables, as long as they are thoroughly cooked.Feeding dogs a vegetarian or vegan diet can hurt their digestive system, since it's tough for dogs to break down large amounts of vegetables.
Supplement your dog's homemade meals with vitamins made for dogs, to make sure they get everything they need. Talk with your vet about supplements you can buy. Be especially careful to make sure your dog has enough calcium, or she may suffer bone injuries as she grows and ages. ;
, Some say that raw meat is better for dogs, since they aren't susceptible to the organisms that make humans sick from eating raw steak or chicken.Other sources claim that cooked meat is a safer choice.A raw meat diet often also include bones, which provide dogs with necessary calcium and other nutrients.Conduct research to decide what type of meat you want to feed your dog. Ask your vet if you want more information on the subject.

"
"
Cook 2.5 cups meat.,
Prepare 2 cups of cooked starch.,
Cook 1.25 cups produce.,
Add calcium.,
Mix the ingredients.",How to Make Dog Food2," You may use ground beef, chicken, lamb, turkey or any other type of meat your dog likes. Cook it by frying, boiling, baking, sauteing or otherwise heating it through.


Add a small amount of organ meat to this recipe every other week, to ensure your dog gets the vitamins she needs.
Olive oil is safe for dogs to eat, so feel free to use it to keep meat from sticking to your pots and pans.
There is no need to season the meat with salt and pepper. Dogs don't have the same taste buds that humans do, and too many spices can upset their stomachs.

, Use white or brown rice (brown rice may be helpful if your dog has digestive problems), oatmeal, barley or cooked pasta. Cook the starch a few minutes longer than you normally would to make it easier for your dog to digest.

, Use fresh or frozen fruit or vegetables, such as green beans, squash, broccoli, spinach, peas, carrots, bananas, or berries. Boil them until they're completely soft, then transfer them to a blender and puree until smooth.


Dogs have trouble digesting vegetables, so it's important to make sure they're completely smooth before serving them to your dog.
If you don't have the time or inclination to puree vegetables and fruits, you can substitute baby food or frozen pureed food. Just make sure it's sugar free.

, Dogs need a lot of calcium to build healthy bones, so its important to add it to their daily diet. Prepare 1/2 teaspoon crushed eggshells or one teaspoon bone meal, which is available at pet stores.

, Place the meat, starch, pureed vegetables, and calcium supplement in a large mixing bowl. Stir the mixture thoroughly, then divide the dog food into serving-sized portions. Place the portions you don't serve right away in airtight food storage containers and refrigerate them until serving time.

"
Buy raw meat.,
Prepare the extras.,
Add greens.,
Serve the raw meal.",How to Make Dog Food3," Go to your grocery store or butcher and purchase one of the following types of raw meat. Buy it with the bone in, since uncooked bones are soft enough for your dog to chew and eat.


Chicken without bones. Poultry bones are brittle, they can get stuck in the dogs throat and can therefore be very dangerous to eat for your pup.
Pork meat, bones, head and tail.
Cow meat (not bones, since they are too hard) or calf meat and calf bones.
Lamb meat, bones and heads.

, Raw meat can be supplemented with other flavorful sources of vitamins and minerals your dog needs to be healthy.


Liver, heart, and tripe.
Whole eggs.
Tinned or whole fresh fish.

, Dogs eating a raw food diet get almost everything they need from meat, but including some vegetables in their diet is a great way to add variety. Puree one or more of the following vegetables in the blender:

Spinach, carrots, collards or parsnips.
Apples, pears or other fruit your dog likes.

, Fill your dog's bowl with the proper amount of food according to her weight. It should be composed of mostly raw meat with a few extras and a dollop of vegetables or fruit. Store leftover meat and other dog food in an airtight food container in the refrigerator.

, Tear it into small pieces that you will be able to fold into your dough.

,, If the dough is too thick, add a little more chicken stock or water and stir again. If it is too sticky, add some more flour.

, Roll out the dough to the thickness you desire and cut out as many biscuits as you can, being careful not to waste too much of the dough. It's up to you how big or small you make the treats. Larger dogs prefer bigger, thicker biscuits with a more satisfying crunch, whereas smaller dogs won't be able to fit their jaws around big biscuits. Make the biscuits whatever size and shape is best for your dog.

, Grease a baking tray with a little butter or line with parchment paper. Lay the biscuits on the tray and place in the oven which has been preheated at 200°C for 10 to 15 minutes until golden brown.

Gather your ingredients, and set out your utensils.,
Combine the yogurt, mashed bananas, and peanut butter in a large bowl.,
Pour into 3-oz Dixie cups or muffin cups.,
Freeze overnight.,
Remove the treat from the cup when giving it to your dog.","How to Make Banana, Peanut and Yogurt Dog Treats1"," By making sure that you are prepared to make your treats, you reduce the possibility of mess and cross-contamination that might occur as you reach around in your kitchen for a tool or food item. Be prepared, and make it easy on yourself.


Make sure none of the ingredients contain the artificial sweetener xylitol, which is deadly to dogs.
Dogs with a history of pancreatitis should avoid this treat because of the fat content in the peanut butter.;
, Make sure you to mix your ingredients well. This will make sure that your dog isn't getting too much of one thing. Peanut butter is great for dogs, but in small doses.

, A dozen or so cups should be enough, but keep a few more handy, just in case. Make sure to keep in mind how big you want your treats to be.


Think about the size of your dog. If your dog is little, you should put less of the mixture in each cup.
Don't put popsicle sticks or toothpicks in them. These will hurt your dog.

, By letting the treats sit overnight in freezer, you can make sure that they are frozen all the way through. Because these are frozen treats, not only will they help cool your dog down on those dog days of summer, they take longer to eat. If your puppy popsicles aren't frozen, they're not as much fun for your dog.

, Your dog might eat the cup. The treat should pop out if you just squeeze it. But if you're having trouble, just tear the cup away.

In a separate bowl, add the mashed banana, yogurt, eggs, and vanilla extract.,
Add the wet ingredients to the rice flour, and fold together with a spatula.,
Distribute evenly among cupcake tins.,
Bake until a toothpick can be inserted in the center and comes out clean.","How to Make Banana, Peanut and Yogurt Dog Treats2"," If you don't preheat your oven, it will take longer to cook your food. You have to make sure your oven is the correct temperature when you put the treats in, so that they cook properly.

, This is so that your treats don't stick to the pan. By greasing the pan, you make sure they don't break apart when you take them out of it.

, Rice is much easier for dogs to digest than other grain flour. Unlike most other grains, dogs can absorb most of the carbohydrates in rice.It also will help to stabilize you treat, so it doesn't just fall apart once out of the oven.

, Mix and let cool, but not too much. You should be able to put your finger in it, without hurting yourself. If you do not, you might cook your eggs prematurely, causing them not to mix with the other ingredients.


On the stove-top, use a small pot. Warm with low heat. This should not take long. Be careful not to burn it. Butter burns easily.
In the microwave, make sure that your bowl or container is microwave-safe. Try 20 to 30 seconds at first. Nuke it longer only if needed. You can burn butter in the microwave just like on the stove.
If the butter is mostly melted, give it a stir and wait a minute. It will likely melt more.

, Then slowly mix in your melted butter mixture, before the butter firms up.

, Do this until the mixture is evenly combined. Don't worry about little lumps of flour. Your dog won't mind. Do not over-mix.

, You don't want to fill the spaces in the pan fully. These are for a dog, and they are treats.

, This is because, when fully cooked, the batter will not be sticky, as much of the water cooks out. Don't worry if they are a little over-done. Check after 20 minutes.


The most important part is to cook the treats all the way through. Not only can it be dangerous to eat under-cooked eggs, your treat will fall apart.
A softer treat, maybe for older dogs, will take less time to cook than a crunchier treat for a dog with stronger teeth.
Make sure that no matter what size or crunchiness you wish of your dog treats, you fill each cup of your cupcake pan to the same point, otherwise they will cook unevenly.

Combine your ingredients in a bowl.,
Place evenly distributed dollops of your mixture on your sheet.,
Dehydrate overnight at 125 degrees.,
Separate treats from tray or parchment, and store in a cool, dry place.","How to Make Banana, Peanut and Yogurt Dog Treats3"," A sheet of parchment paper on a regular dehydrator tray will work for this as well. Placing these treats on a regular dehydrator tray, without an additional solid layer, will cause a big mess. It will be a hassle, and you'll waste all that perfectly good dog food.

, Rub the paper towel on the fruit leather sheet or parchment. A thin coating will suffice. You just need to keep the treats from sticking to the tray or the paper.

, Make sure to mix them well.

, This kind of distribution helps to ensure that your treats all dehydrate at the same rate. They don't have to all be exactly the same. Just think about the size of each treat you wish to give to your dog.

, There is a delicate balance between the speed and temperature you dehydrate your treats. Like freezing, but unlike baking, dehydrated yogurt can retain its pro-biotic properties. At temperatures above 130° Fahrenheit (55°C), the good bacteria in yogurt will die.To be safe, keep your dehydrator running between 115 and 130° Fahrenheit (45 and 55°C).

, Dehydrated treats such as these are shelf-stable. Though they will eventually expire, they should last quite a while in your cabinet or pantry. They do not need to be refrigerated.

It should be the size of a normal piece of paper, but the long sides are longer. After rolling, pour the cinnamon into different spots of the dough then rub it gently so it will not tear. If you'd like, pour the 2 tbsp of honey on it. Then roll the long side of the dough like rolls of toilet paper so it looks like a real cinnamon bun.

Look for other common diseases.",How to Care for Great Danes," Since your Great Dane is considered a large or giant breed of dog, you need to feed him food specifically designed for this. This will ensure the he gets the proper ratio of nutrients for him to grow properly and maintain a strong skeletal system for his large body.


If you aren't sure what food to get your Great Dane, ask your vet or the breeder you got him from. They will be able to help you decide. A good rule of thumb is if the first two ingredients are meat (not meat by-products), then it’s probably a good food.;
, To help your Great Dane avoid a life-threatening condition known as bloat and otherwise keep him healthy, you should give him the best high-quality food you can get. Look on the label of any food you are considering for the list of ingredients. The concentration of protein should not be more than 23 to 25%, especially when your Great Dane is a puppy. This can cause growth problems because he won't be able to metabolize too much of it.Meat should be one of the first two ingredients. It should also have vegetables in it as well.
Meat by-product is okay really far down on the list, but it shouldn't be in the first five ingredients., You should never feed your Great Dane large meals. He needs small meals throughout the day instead of large meals, since these can cause bloat. This means you need to look at the recommended daily amount on the back of the dog food bag and then split that up into three to four meals a day.


You should also not change his food abruptly, because this can also cause intestinal issues., There are certain foods that you should never feed your Great Dane. These can cause health issues and even kill him. These foods include:Chocolate
Avocados
Grapes or raisins
Alcohol
Fatty meat scraps
Various nuts
Onions, garlic and chives
Cooked bones or chicken bones
Yeast dough
Xylitol, a substance found in sugar free foods

, If you want to use human food as a treat for your Great Dane, there are a few you can feed him. These include:Small chunks of cooked sweet potatoes
Frozen peas or blueberries in small amounts
Baby carrots

, In order to stay healthy, your Great Dane will need access to water. Since he is so big, he will need a lot of water throughout the day. Make sure you check his water bowl often.


Remember to limit his water drinking after he eats, which will help avoid bloat.

, A good brushing every week or two will help keep your Great Dane's short coat soft and healthy.This will also help cut down on shedding and encourage skin circulation. Use this time to check for fleas and ticks. If you find them, you should use topical treatments to fight against them.


You can also use this time to look for bumps, lumps, skin irritations, or scratches. Keep a check on these and take him to the vet if you notice any issues or if they get worse., When you are brushing your Great Dane, you can also check his nails. He may not need a lot of trimming since he is so large. His size and his level of activity will keep then worn down, but he may have one or two that might get too long. If this happens, you will need to trim them.


Buy dog nail clippers from the pet store. When looking at the nail, make sure you look on the back side of the nail for a triangle shaped area, which is the quick of the nail that houses blood vessels and nerves. Cutting this will hurt your dog and may cause infection.
If you aren't sure how to do this, ask your vet or a vet technician to show you how to do it at home or take him to have them cut., To ensure your Great Dane doesn't have teeth issues, you need to brush his teeth regularly, which is about once a week. You need to get him used to you brushing his teeth, so let him lick some dog toothpaste off your finger first, then wipe some along his gums. The next day, rub some toothpaste into his gums with your finger so he gets used to the feeling. The next day, you can try a toothbrush on just the outer side of his teeth. The inside takes care of itself.You may have to use your fingers a few times before he will allow the brush.
Never use human toothpaste because fluoride is poisonous to dogs.
You can also use dental formulated treats to help remove plaque.

, In order for your Great Dane to be friendly and happy, he needs to meet other animals and people. This means you need to take him to communal places, such as dog parks, rides in the car, neighborhood walks, pet stores, or obedience classes.


Your Great Dane craves human companionship, so make sure he has plenty of interaction with you and your family., Your Great Dane needs to be exercised every day. This will help keep him healthy and happy, but make sure the exercise isn't too strenuous. You should not use your Great Dane as a running partner or do other really intense exercise because it can cause injury to his skeletal system. He can run and play, but not for long periods of time.


You should not do any harsh running or strenuous play for long periods of time when he is younger than 18 months. At this point, his body is still growing, which means too much strenuous exercise can put too much strain on his growing bones and cause malformations.
Make sure to wait at least an hour after he eats to for exercise. This will help prevent bloat., Although your Great Dane is large, he is fine living inside with you and your family. He will be happy being near you curled up on a bed every day, as long as you exercise him enough. His bed should be cushy enough to keep him from rubbing against the floor, which can cause joint damage.


Keeping your Great Dane inside will also allow you to provide him with enough love and affection, which is essential for this breed. He will act out if he doesn't receive enough love and affection.
Your Great Dane can live outside, but you have to make sure you spend enough time with him outside or he will act out., When your Great Dane is six weeks old, he needs to have a checkup to have an overall examination. If you get your dog from a breeder, the breeder should have already taken the pup for a checkup. The vet should look at the:Heart and lungs
Eyes and ears
Mouth, where the vet will look to ensure no opening in the palate
Belly and groin, where the vet will check for hernias
Skin, to check for mites, fleas, and ticks

, When your Great Dane is a puppy, he should be dewormed. This should start at the six week checkup, but he needs two to three additional deworming treatments. These should be two weeks apart, which will help kill any additional worms., During his first checkup, your Great Dane will also need to have a vaccination for distemper. This should be followed three to four weeks after this by a booster for the vaccine. These may fall under the responsibility of the breeder if you adopt your Great Dane at eight weeks, but you should make sure he has this vaccine when you get him.Your Great Dane will also need a Lyme disease vaccine at nine weeks old, with a booster when he is 12 weeks old.
He will also need a rabies vaccination at 12 weeks old.

, Once your Great Dane is eight weeks old, he needs to be started on heartworm prevention medication. This will prevent him from getting heartworm, which can cause serious health problems and even death. Once you start this medication, it should be given to him once a month.

, Between the ages of six to 10 months, you need to neuter your Great Dane (or spay if female). This will help prevent unwanted puppies, help prevent some infections or cancers, and cut down on aggressive behavior.If you plan to breed your Great Dane, don't have him neutered.

, After the early series of vaccines, boosters, and deworming, your Great Dane will need to go to the vet for a yearly checkup starting at one year old. When he turns five, it is best if you take him for two checkups a year to ensure he doesn't have any medical issues., The number one killer of Great Danes is bloat and gastric torsion. This is a life-threatening disease that affects his gastrointestinal system. You can combat bloat by:Feeding small, frequent meals of high-quality dog food
Avoiding all exercise for at least an hour after eating; this includes walking and rambunctious playing
Limiting water intake after eating to a small amount
Feeding him from a bowl at floor-level, since elevated bowls may cause bloat
Investing in a slow-feeder dish that will force him to eat slower, especially if he gulps up his food

, Because of your Great Dane's size, his average lifespan will be about eight years. He is also susceptible to some diseases and conditions, such as Wobbler syndrome, also called cervical spondylomyelopathy (CSM). This condition is a malformation of the neck vertebrae of the spine that causes drunken or wobbly gait and spinal compression, which may cause paralysis.


Your Great Dane may be born with this condition, which will present young, or it may form with age or because of trauma., Other than bloat and Wobbler syndrome, your Great Dane may be susceptible to a few other diseases and conditions. These include:Cancer
Heart disease
Hypothyroidism
Cataracts

Train your dog.,
Exercise your dog.,
Socialize your dog.,
Microchip your dog.",How to Care for Labradoodles1," Your Labradoodle is a wonderful breed for training. To get the best results, start training him early, at least within the first six months that you have him. Start by teaching him basic commands with a reward-based system.


Start by using treats to gain his attention, show him how to do a command such as ‘sit’, then give him a treat. Continue to do this until he can do the trick on your command on his own.
This will work with most basic commands, with additional commands such as ‘come,’ ‘stay,’ or ‘roll over.’
You can start as early as eight weeks, but his attention span may be short. Be patient with him and he will eventually learn.;
, Your Labradoodle will need high energy exercise every day. He is a great pet to powerwalk and run with. He is sturdy and energetic, so he will make a great running partner. You can also play fetch and other high energy activities with him. This will keep him active, happy, and help burn off some of his energy.


If you don’t exercise him enough, he may be more likely to act out his energy in other ways, such as chewing, barking, or digging.Wait until he is older than nine months to run with him. If he is any younger, his legs will not be developed enough.

, In order for your Labradoodle to be well behaved and nice to other people and animals, you need to socialize him within the first eight to 18 weeks. This means you need to take him around people of all ages, genders, and sizes as well as introduce him to all kinds of animals. This way, he won’t be scared or aggressive towards any one type of person or animal.


Take him to a dog park or out walking with you. This is a great way for him to see all different kinds of people.
You can also try obedience classes or puppy socialization classes. Check your local pet store or ask your veterinarian.
Wait until after his first round of vaccinations to introduce him to other dogs., In order to keep track of your dog in case he is ever lost, stolen, or goes missing, consider getting a microchip for him. This is a relatively painless process for your dog, generally costs under $50, and can be done by your vet during a normal visit."

You should also choose a food that is meant for small breed dogs. Regular dog food pieces may be too large for your Havanese to chew, while food meant for small dogs comes in smaller pieces.If you can’t decide on what to feed your Havanese, then check with your Havanese’s breeder or veterinarian.
Also, keep Havanese’s age in mind when choosing food. If your Havanese is a puppy, then you will need to feed him puppy food. If your Havanese is a senior, then you will need to feed him senior food.;
, Dogs have different nutritional needs than humans and some human foods can even kill them. If you plan to cook for your Havanese, then you should talk to an expert on pet nutrition first.


Your veterinarian is a good place to start, but she may refer you to a specialist for advice.

, The number of times per day that you will need to feed your Havanese depends on his age. Your Havanese will need to be fed often while he is a puppy and less often as an adult. Talk to your veterinarian if you are unsure about the right type of feeding schedule for your Havanese. In general, if your Havanese is:


eight to 12 weeks, then feed her four times per day.
three to six months, then feed her three time per day.
six months to one year old, then feed her twice per day.
past one year old, then feed her once per day., Your Havanese must always have access to a bowl of fresh, clean water. Make sure to you replenish your Havanese’s water as needed and clean the bowl once per day.


Place your Havanese’s water dish somewhere that he can access with ease.

Choose a food for active dogs.,
Consider your GSP’s age.,
Develop a regular feeding schedule.,
Provide plenty of fresh clean water.,
Give your GSP a few treats.,
Steer clear of foods that are toxic to your GSP.",How to Care for German Shorthaired Pointers1," German short-haired pointers are active, high-energy dogs, so they require a high-quality dog food that provides plenty of protein and fat. A good way to determine if a food is high-quality is to read the ingredients. If the first two ingredients listed are meat (not meat by-products), then the food is most likely a high quality food.


Some dog food companies make dog food that is formulated for medium-sized dogs. This might be a good option for your GSP.Check with your dog’s veterinarian or ask your breeder for suggestions if you are not sure what to feed your GSP.
If the breeder was using a specific brand of food, then it is a good idea to stick with that brand.;
, Depending on the age of your GSP, you may need to choose a special age-specific food. For example, if you have a GSP puppy, then you will need a puppy food. If you have an older adult dog, then you will need to choose a senior food.Your dog’s age may also affect the number of times that you need to feed him. Adult GSPs will need to be fed twice per day, but puppies may need to be fed more often.If your puppy is:


eight to 12 weeks, then do four feedings per day
three to six months, then do three feedings per day
six months to one year old, then do two feedings per day, Some people choose to free-feed their dogs, which can result in the dog becoming overweight or obese. Therefore, it is better to maintain a regular feeding schedule for your GSP and to measure his food portions. To determine how much to feed your dog, you will need to consider his weight and activity level.


Check your dog’s food package for a basic guideline on how much to feed your dog according to his weight. If you are still not sure if you are feeding the right amount of food to your GSP, then check with your dog’s veterinarian.
Most GSPs require between two to five cups of dry food per day. The more active your GSP is, the more food he will need. For example, a dog that is mostly sedentary would probably only need two cups per day, while a GSP that is very active will probably need closer to five cups of food per day.Divide your dog’s daily food intake into two meals. For example, if your dog needs two cups of food per day, then you could give him one cup in the morning and one cup in the evening.

, GSPs get thirsty from all of their physical activity, so they need to have access to a bowl of fresh, clean water at all times. Stainless steel bowls are ideal because these are less bacteria-friendly.Keep the bowl of water somewhere that is easy for your GSP to access.
Clean the water dish and change out the water it at least once per day.

, Treats are a great way to reward your GSP, but try to keep treats to a minimum to avoid the chance of your GSP becoming overweight. If you want to feed treats try these nutritious, low-calorie foods:


baby carrots
rinsed canned green beans
cooked sweet potatoes, sliced
a few frozen peas or blueberries

, You will need to avoid feeding your GSP certain human foods that can make them ill or kill them. These foods include:avocados
alcohol
chocolate
grapes and raisins
macadamia nuts, almonds, pecans, and walnuts
onions, garlic, and chives
yeast dough
xylitol (often found in sugar free foods)"

Brush his fur.,
Take him to the groomers.,
Look after his nails.,
Brush his teeth.",How to Care for Labradoodles2," Your Labradoodle’s curly fur coat will need to be brushed weekly to keep out the mats. His fur may be anywhere from wavy to tightly curly, so the amount of mats that may develop in it will vary depending on the texture.


If his hair is really curly, you may need to brush is twice a week.
While you are brushing him, look for fleas, ticks, lumps, scraps, scabs, bumps, or any other skin abnormalities.
When he is going from puppy to adult dog, you will need to brush out his fur more often. His softer puppy hair will start to tangle with the adult curly hair and may cause problems if left alone too long., While your Labradoodle is still a puppy, you can start taking him to the groomers every few weeks or months so he gets used to it. After he is about a year old, he will need to be taken to the groomers every four to six months to get a fur trim.


Many owners like to take their Labradoodle to the groomers in between these visits, about every four to six weeks, to maintain his coat, have his nails looked at, and have him bathed.

, Since your Labradoodle is a large dog, he may not need to have his nails trimmed every week. However, you should look at them every week when you brush him. Check for any soreness, broken nails, or any that need to be trimmed.


If his nails do need to be trimmed, make sure you watch out for the quick of the nails, which will be pink, because it is where the nerves and blood vessels are.
If you take him to the groomer every four to six weeks, they can take care of his nails when they need to be trimmed., Your Labradoodle’s teeth are important, so you need to brush them once a week. Start by using your finger with dog toothpaste, then move up to a gentle pass with a dig toothbrush the next day, then finally get to where you can brush all his teeth the day after that. It will get easier as he gets used to the process.


Never use human toothpaste on a dog because it is toxic."

Buy high quality food.,
Avoid overfeeding your dog.,
Try a raw diet.",How to Care for Labradoodles3," Your Labradoodle needs high quality food to be healthy and happy. Look at the labels of the dog food you buy him. The first two ingredients should be meat and vegetables to ensure that it is a high quality food. Make sure to avoid food with meat by-products in the first few ingredients.If you aren’t sure which brands to feed your dog, ask your vet.

, Since your Labradoodle is more prone to conditions that can cause arthritis, be more conscious about how much you feed him. If he gets overweight, his bones will have undue stress on them, which may make these conditions more possible. Look on the back of his food bag or can to see the serving suggestions for his weight.


You should also avoid feeding him too many treats throughout the day. The calories in them can add up over time and cause him to gain weight.If you want to reward him, try baby carrots or canned, no salt added green beans.

, If you aren’t happy with the commercial food you find for your Labradoodle, think about a raw diet. This is a diet you make yourself at home. Never start this diet without first consulting your vet and an animal nutrition expert. Your Labradoodle has specific nutritional needs that will not be met if you aren’t aware of how to balance his diet, which can lead to serious illness.


There are some web resources that have many different raw dog food recipes created by nutritionists, but always ask your animal nutritionist or vet first."

Start by replacing a quarter of their old food with the new food, and increase that amount by a small portion each day until they are only eating the new food.Toy Eskies should continue to be multiple fed meals throughout the day to prevent hypoglycemia. This is not a concern in miniature or standard varieties, who can be fed twice a day after they reach six months old."

Introduce the Eskie to their new family.,
Spend time with your Eskie.,
Introduce the puppy to strangers.,
Take the puppy out into public.",How to Care for an American Eskimo Puppy3," If have children or other pets, you will need to make sure that they get along with your Eskie puppy. Supervise all interactions until you are satisfied that the puppy understands how to interact with the others in the household.



Introduce dogs while they are leashed outside. Reward them both with treats if they act friendly towards one another. Afterwards, you may take them into your home. Separate them with a baby gate until they are used to each others' presence.If you have a cat, you should keep the two separated for a few days until they are used to each others' scent. When you first introduce the two, watch the puppy carefully. If the cat ignores the puppy or acts friendly towards the Eskie, you should praise the cat.Teach your children how to properly handle the puppy before the Eskie comes into your home. Inform them that if the dog nips or growls, it means that the puppy does not want to be touched or played with. Do not let the children play with the puppy unless you are there to watch them., Puppies require constant supervision, especially when they first come home. For a social dog like the American Eskimo, you should make sure that the puppy’s first days home are spent with the family. Make sure that the whole family plays and interacts with the puppy. This will begin their socialization training, and it will help them settle more easily into their new home., One of the most common behavioral problems in American Eskimos is a fear of strangers. While Eskies are loving around their family, they can act shy or aggressive when new people come too close. While your Eskie is still young, you should introduce strangers into the home to let them get used to new people. Supervise these meetings carefully., Your puppy should not be confined to your home or else they will grow overprotective of their family and territory. Bring your Eskie outside into public as often as you can while they are still a puppy. Being around people and other dogs in public will let them get used to the sights, sounds, and stimulations of new places and reduce their anxiety as an adult.


While you should never leave your dog alone in the car, you can bring your Eskie out on car trips to expose them to a wide variety of sounds, sights, and places."

Brush their coat twice a week.,
Bathe the puppy every few months.,
Trim the fur around their feet.,
Clip their nails as needed.",How to Care for an American Eskimo Puppy4," While the Eskie’s long white coat resists dirt naturally, it is prone to matting if not brushed. You should brush their fur twice a week with a slicker brush, pin brush, or metal Greyhound comb.If your dog’s fur is matted or tangled, you should spray it with a fur detangler before slowing brushing it out from the roots.
During the spring and fall, the Eskie will start to shed their fur.During these periods, you should groom them more frequently to prevent your furniture and clothing from being completely covered in fur., Eskies need baths roughly every three months.Brush your Eskie beforehand to untangle any snarls or matts. Baths can worsen matted fur, so do not bathe your Eskie if their fur is too tangled to pass a brush or comb through it.You may also consider hiring a professional groomer to bathe them. The groomer can help take of matted fur and may be more experienced with bathing a wriggling puppy.

, Your Eskie will grow plenty of fur around their feet. This fur can easily become wet or muddy. If you are worried about your dog tracking in dirt, you can clip back the fur around the foot or ask your groomer to shave between the pads of their feet.If you are planning on showing your Eskie at competitions, you should know that the foot fur is expected to be long. You can trim the fur to keep it neat, but the fur should not be shaved back., Generally, your Eskie should have their toenails clipped every five weeks. If you notice, however, that their toenails are touching the floor while standing, you should clip them back so that your dog is not in pain.To clip your dog's nails, hold their paw firmly in your hand. Trim the nails until you see a small circle develop on the cut surface.
Look for a small, red blood vessel in their nail. This is called the quick. If you clip the quick, it may start to bleed. You want to stop clipping before you reach the quick.
If you do accidentally clip the quick, stop the bleeding by putting styptic powder or corn starch on it."

Create a feeding schedule.,
Mix dry kibble and wet ingredients.,
Use a special bowl.,
Consider a supplement.",How to Care for an Akita Inu Dog1," Akita Inu dogs have a powerful appetite. Feeding them properly is key to preserving good health. An Akita Inu should be fed two meals a day.As with most dogs, it's a good idea to feed your Akita Inu at roughly the same times every day, once in the morning, once in the evening.Each meal should be approximately two to three cups of food. Start your dog off on one and half cups and see if it is all eaten. If so, increase the amount slightly next time. Do not feed the dog more than it will typically eat within 10 minutes of feeding.
Overfeeding your dog can result in bloat, a potentially fatal condition.
Some Akita Inu owners believe the dog should made to fast once a week for its health and to reduce the risk of bloat. Fasting is thought to have a cleansing effect on the digestive tract. If you decide to try this, you may still give your dog small amounts of food, such as small pieces of fruit with the skin removed.;
, The best food for an Akita Inu is a high-quality kibble with one or fresh ingredients mixed in. Look for kibble rich in fish and poultry, avoid kibble with lots of wheat and/or soy. Mix in any of the following:Rice (be careful, some Akita Inu dogs have an intolerance to brown rice)
Vegetables (carrots, peas, and cooked potatoes are best)
Eggs (boiled, never raw)
Yogurt (plain)
Canned tunaThese fresh ingredients should make up about 25 percent of the calories your dog consumes.To get the ratio correct, you will need to look at the caloric content of the dog's food and the fresh ingredients you are adding.

, Ask at your local pet store for a bowl that will slow down the dog's eating. These dogs tend to eat fast, which is bad for digestion and can lead to bloat.Slow-feeding bowls have a shape the prevents the dog from gulping down all its food in a few bites., In large part because of its thyroid gland, the Akita Inu does not naturally produce enough iodine. Consider adding a supplement to your dogs food at meal time.Akita Inu dogs can also benefit from a zinc supplement. Ask at your local pet store for a good, dog-friendly supplement to improve you Akita Inu's diet, checking to make sure it contains iodine and zinc.
Talk to your veterinarian before adding any supplements or otherwise significantly changing your dog's diet.

Know the health history of your pet.,
Take your Mastiff in for regular check-ups.,
Watch out for bloat.,
Test your dog for canine cystinuria.,
Look out for joint problems.,
Get regular heart exams.",How to Care for an English Mastiff1," Before you buy a Mastiff, be sure that the breeder provides you with independently certified genetic health screenings for the dog’s parents. Check to see that both are free from hereditary diseases and disorders, like hip dysplasia, cardiomyopathy, or retinal atrophy, that could be passed on to your pet. The breeder should also offer a health guarantee for your dog as part of the sales contract.Responsible breeders will have the parents of their litters registered in the Canine Health Information Center database. The records should be searchable and include evaluations of each Mastiff’s eyes, hips, elbows, heart, thyroid, and urine to ensure that their sire and dam do not carry any common genetic diseases that threaten the health of the breed.;
, Register your dog immediately with a nearby veterinary clinic. Having a steady vet who is familiar with the medical records of your pet will help catch any health issues that may arise and ensure that you keep up with your pooch’s vaccination cycles and parasite control treatments., Bloat or “Gastric Torsion” is a severe and potentially life-threatening condition wherein a dog’s digestive processes lead to the overproduction of gas, which fills, twists, and then blocks their stomach. Since English Mastiffs are prone to it, it’s important to know the symptoms and get your pet to a vet immediately if they show any of them.The symptoms include dry retching (without being able to vomit), excessive thirst, severe salivation, and abdominal swelling. Your dog will also likely show other signs of discomfort, such as pacing, restlessness, and hanging their head low.
The exact causes of bloat are unknown, but, there are some practices that can help minimize your Mastiff’s risk. For instance, they’ll be less susceptible if you feed them two well-spaced meals a day and plan their exercise so that it does not immediately precede or follow a meal.

, This genetic kidney disease causes bladder stones and potentially life-threatening urinary blockages. The condition is rare, but Mastiffs are at higher risk, so consider getting a urine test. If your dog is having difficulty urinating, take them to the vet immediately for screening.Since the causes of this disease are genetic, it’s impossible to prevent and difficult to control with prescriptions or dietary therapies. If your Mastiff develops this condition, it will very likely require surgery.

, Due to their massive size, structural issues are not uncommon for English Mastiffs, young or old. They can start very early in life since Mastiff puppies have a much longer development period than most dogs (from 2-3 years). If your pup is having trouble getting up and down or moving about in a natural way on all four legs, take them to the vet for an examination.Hip and elbow dysplasia as well as cruciate ligament injuries in their knees are the most common joint ailments Mastiffs face.
You can actively take steps to prevent future joint issues by ensuring that you keep young Mastiffs lean to avoid putting extra pressure on their bones and ligaments. You should do this by keeping them from overeating rather than through strenuous exercise, since playing too hard can also cause significant structural problems down the line.

, English Mastiffs are genetically susceptible to heart disease, including cardiomyopathy, pulmonic stenosis, mitral dysplasia, and subaortic stenosis. Be sure that your vet gives your pooch a heart check-up each time you go in for an appointment, to catch these conditions early when they’re still treatable."

Apply sunscreen.,
Buy a sweater.,
Treat acne.",How to Care for Chinese Crested Dogs1," Because Chinese Crested dogs have hairless bodies, their skin is prone to sunburn. If you know you will be spending an extended amount time in the sun, for example 45 minutes or more, apply sunscreen on your dog. Use dog-safe, recommended sunscreen. You can find this at pet supply stores.Apply sunscreen sparingly. Excess lotion will block your dog’s pores and lead to acne. Always bathe your dog afterwards.You can also limit sun exposure by providing shady areas or by carrying an umbrella with you whenever you go outdoors.
If you dog does get sunburned, apply an aftersun aloe lotion to soothe the skin. You can use an over-the-counter aloe vera lotion normally used by humans. If you are concerned about the sunburn, contact your vet.;
, You will also need to protect your dog during the winter months. Prevent your Chinese Crested dog from becoming too cold by buying sweaters. Sweaters keep your dog warm during the winter months.Do not purchase sweaters that are 100% wool. The wool can cause your dog’s skin to become irritated. Instead, buy a sweater that is a mix of wool and cotton or acrylic.If you live in a wet or rainy area, purchase a sweater that is rain and snow resistant. Sweaters that absorb water can make your dog colder than no sweater at all., Like human skin, the skin of Chinese Crested dogs is prone to acne. You can treat acne with the same products used to treat human acne. However, it is always best to talk with your vet about the best products to use to treat your dog’s acne.Avoid squeezing or popping pimples and blackheads. Squeezing and/or popping pimples can cause infections, scarring, and discolor the skin.
Make sure to keep your dog's hair groomed. Long hair can cause your dog's skin to breakout in acne.

Train your dog to respond to basic commands.,
Train your Doberman on a regular basis.",How to Care for Doberman Pincshers," The American Kennel Club (AKC) describes the temperament of the Doberman as energetic, determined, watchful, loyal, and fearless.This goes some way to describe the alert intelligence of the Doberman. When channeled correctly through good training, their energy and willfulness make them a potent working dog and a great pet.;
, Due to the size and power of the Doberman, if its handler is not knowledgeable and confident, the dog has the potential to become dangerous. The Doberman is not a suitable breed for a first time owner. Indeed, the ideal owner should be an experienced dog owner who is prepared to devote time and attention to the correct training and exercising (both mental and physical) of their dog. If this happens then a Doberman is likely to be a wonderful, attentive, and loyal companion who is devoted to their owner.


In the wrong hands a Doberman (through no fault of its own) could become either fearful (and therefore aggressive in order to protect himself from perceived threats) or territorially aggressive. Neither is a desirable scenario an out of control doberman is a danger to life and limb.
A well-trained Doberman can make a great family dog, but supervision is essential around small children as this dog is very energetic and if a small child gets in the way, the dog may push them over.

, Being a large dog, and an athletic one at that, Dobermans need adequate space to move around. Apartment living is not a great option for a dog this active and large unless you will give it enough exercise for your dog to spill out all of its energy. And of course, make sure your land lord allows dog, do not try to hide a dog, ever!


Indeed, the Doberman also needs access to a decent sized yard, in order to stretch its legs between walks. This yard should also be fenced, as a Doberman may become defensive if a stranger wanders over its territory; keep in mind these dogs were specifically bred to protect.

, You should be prepared to devote at least 2 hours a day to exercising your Doberman, an hour in the morning and again in the evening. Their working origins and athleticism mean they have a high requirement for exercise.

, You should weigh the costs associated with keeping any large dog. You need to provide a good quality food, since cheap foods bulked up with cereal may ferment in the dog's gut and predispose it to bloat. Obviously good quality foods are more expensive than that cheap food, and the cost of feeding the required amount can be considered.


Also, deworming and anti-parasite treatments are going to cost more than for a small dog.

, The Doberman should stand around 24 - 28 inches tall at the shoulders, with males being taller than females. The classic color is black with tan markings, but red, blue, and fawn are also permissible by the AKC.The Doberman weighs 60 - 80 lbs and the average lifespan is 10 - 13 years.In the US the ears are usually cropped, while in the UK this procedure is considered a cosmetic mutilation and frowned upon.

, There are pros and cons to both. There are lots of dogs in shelters that need homes. These dogs can be great companions but they are less likely to be pure bred dogs.


One perk of getting a puppy from a breeder is that you get to mold it into a mature adult. If you are committed to thoroughly training a dog, a puppy may be ideal.

, Never, ever buy a puppy from a puppy mill. A cardinal signs of a puppy mill is the breeder makes an excuse as to why the mother dog is not available to view. This is because in reality the mother dogs is probably hundreds of miles away, waiting to be bred to produce yet more puppies. In the meantime her litter are taken away far too young and transported large distances to places for sale.


This trade is unethical and immoral, and should not be encouraged by buying these puppies and creating a demand.

, A good breeder will make sure to socialize his or her dogs in order to guarantee they grow into confident well-adjusted adult dogs. This is especially important for the Doberman, who can be prone to anxiety or territorial behavior. Proper socialization as a puppy helps make the youngster accepting of strangers, rather than suspicious of them. This makes it less anxious and therefore better adjusted to life with people.


The breeder should make efforts for as many different people as possible to meet the puppies from around 3 - 4 weeks of age, so the young dogs are used to people of different heights, appearances, and tones of voice. The puppies should not be exclusively reared in a kennel as this isolates them from the normal sights, sounds, and activities of a domestic house, and they will find it more difficult to adjust to family life.

, The Doberman is prone to a number of genetic health problems, some of which the parents can be tested for and some not. For example, Dobermans are prone to hip dysplasia and Von Willebrand's disease.Responsible breeders will screen the parent dogs for hip dysplasia and have certification to show what their score is (the lower the better.)


A low hip score is no guarantee the puppies won't have poor hip anatomy, but it reduces the risk of this happening.
There is also a blood test for Von Willebrand's disease, so ideally it would be good to know the parents are negative.

, The Doberman breed is prone to a number of genetic health problems. These include hip dysplasia, Von Willebrand's disease (a disorder affecting blood clotting), cardiomyopathy, cervical spondylopathy (compression of the spinal cord in the neck area), and bilateral flank alopecia.


The wise Doberman owner takes out a pet insurance policy in case their dog needs health care. For example, there are some excellent drugs available which can extend the life of a Doberman suffering from cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscle) but they are costly, especially given the size of the dog., In terms of routine healthcare, your puppy will need vaccinating against various canine infectious diseases. Exactly which diseases depends on which infections are prevalent in your area. Your veterinarian should advise you about what vaccinations your dog should get.


Possible vaccinations that your vet may suggest include: distemper, parvovirus, canine adenovirus, leptospirosis, infectious canine hepatitis, parainfluenza virus, and Lyme disease. In addition, a vaccination against rabies is obligatory in many states and you will be breaking the law not to comply.
Different vaccines are given at different ages. Typically the rabies vaccine is given as a single dose after 12 weeks of age, repeated every 1 to 3 years (depending on the manufacturer) or if given earlier (some brands can be given from 4 weeks of age,) a second dose must be given at or after 12 weeks of age.
Many other vaccines are given in three doses, 3 - 4 weeks apart, with the final dose always falling around 16 weeks of age.This is so the puppy receives protection from the vaccine at a young age, but not so early that it doesn't benefit from the antibodies provided by its mother.
Your Doberman should receive yearly booster injections according to the protocol advised by your vet. The vet will select those diseases with are common in the area (core) and those less common (non-core) and discuss which are most appropriate for your dog.

, Dobermans are likely to spend a lot of time outdoors, so deworming and parasite treatment is essential. Deworming medications come in tablets, oral liquids, oral granules, and spot on treatments. Each product is slightly different, so discuss with your vet which one is best for your pet.


You should give your dog medication for roundworms (monthly) and a quarterly broad-spectrum dewormer, which stops whipworms and tapeworms.
Treatment against heartworm is also advisable, either as a six-monthly injection, or a monthly spot-on treatment at home.
Your dog also should be treated for fleas and ticks. Prevention is better than cure, so this involves using a product effective against fleas and ticks, such as fipronil (Frontline or Effipro) or the Seresto collar. Also, you should check your dog every day for ticks and remove them with a tick hook.

, The obvious advantage of neutering is that it prevents unscheduled breeding. It can also protect the female dog against mammary cancer, if surgery if performed before the bitch's second heat.


Neutering or spaying should be discussed with your veterinarian. It is usual to operate on females from 4 - 6 months of age, and males around 6 -10 months of age, however, this varies depending on the individual vet clinic.

, Look at the label on the bag and make sure a named meat is the first and second ingredient on the bag. Never be tempted to economize by feeding your Doberman on a cheaper food that is bulked up with soy or cereal. These ingredients tend to ferment in the bowel and produce gas.


Unfortunately, the Doberman is renowned for suffering from a serious condition called bloat, where gas builds up in the stomach which then flips over on itself. This condition can kill the dog. The extra gas generated by a cereal rich diet is something to be avoided.

, Wait for at least 90 minutes after feeding your dog before exercising it. Exercising too quickly could cause the dog's stomach to flip over and becoming twisted. This is a life-threatening condition called bloat.Signs of bloat include non-productive retching and restlessness or agitation. If your dog is trying to throw up but bringing nothing up, take it to the vet immediately.Feeding from an elevated bowl is also said to increase the chances of bloat, so place the dog's food bowls on the floor.
Eating quickly and gulping down food makes the dog likely to swallow air. If the dog is greedy consider strategies to slow its eating. You can purchase commercial slow-feeders, or consider putting large rocks (be sure they are too big to swallow) in the feeding bowl so the dog has to eat around them, slowing it down., Begin by following the portion sizes recommended on the package. However, regularly weigh your Doberman to make sure it is not gaining too much weight.


Make sure to know what a healthy body shape is for your dog. If you know the ideal, you can judge whether your dog is under, over, or just the right weight.

, The Doberman is short-haired and its coat actually requires minimal grooming attention. However, burnishing the coat with a rubber mitt helps add gloss and conditions the skin.

, Just be sure to check it over for ticks and awns after each walk. If you find any, remove them.


Checking your dog's body regularly will help you determine when there is something wrong with it. If you know its shape and function when the dog is healthy, you will be able to identify problems more quickly.

, Get in the habit of regular tooth brushing. Use a special dog toothbrush or a finger mitt and dog toothpaste.


To get your dog used to the process, wet the brush with water and gently rub it on the outer surfaces of the teeth. Once the dog is happy with this, you can introduce a blob of dog toothpaste onto the brush. These pastes are tasty to dogs, don't need rinsing, and are free from substances harmful to dogs if swallowed, such as fluoride.

, Dobermans respond well to clicker training. The idea of this training method is to have the dog associate the click-clack sound of the clicker with a reward. The clicker is used to mark the exact moment the dog shows a desired behavior, so that it understands that is what you want it to do and it will earn a reward for repeating the behavior.

, Good basic commands to start with are sit, stay, and recall. Once your dog has mastered those, you can build up to more complex obedience training and tricks.Given the possessive nature of Dobermans, it is also useful to teach them to fetch, carry, and drop objects. This means the dog learns to relinquish objects to you, and it is also a useful way to occupy the dog's mouth (ie by holding something) if it is in a stressful situation and you are worried about the dog barking or snapping at people.

, Begin with two 10 - 20 minute sessions per day, depending on the attention span of your dog. If your dog has a lot of energy and has a hard time concentrating, take it for a short walk before a training session. Keep training fun and enjoyable for the dog. If the dog is having a hard time with a command, and you want to end the session, go back to a command they are good at doing before ending the session. This will end things on a positive note and make the dog happier to return to training later.


Avoid using harsh reprimands or punishments with your Doberman, as this is unnecessary and may drive undesirable behaviors underground.

Check and clean your dog’s mouth, ears, and skin wrinkles regularly.,
Cut down on shedding and loose hair by brushing weekly.,
Maintain your dog’s teeth and nails.",How to Care for Basset Hounds3," Basset Hounds were bred to have wrinkles because they collect tiny particles and improve the sense of smell. However, they can form buildup and chafing, which can both lead to infection.Clean skin folds two or three times a week with a cloth and warm water, and a dog shampoo if buildup is excessive. Thoroughly dry with a clean cloth.
Basset Hounds’ oily coats give them a particular odor. If their smell bothers you, consider bathing them once every week or two., Basset Hounds are heavy shedders, and loose or dead hair tends to build up in their coats. Brushing with a rubber dog brush at least two or three times a week will keep their coat healthy. In addition, it will cut down on the hair that ends up on your clothes and furniture., Basset Hounds require nail and tooth care standard for most dogs. Brush your dog’s teeth at least three times a week using gauze wrapped around your finger, water and, if desired, dog toothpaste. Trim its nails as needed, typically once every couple weeks.If your dog is still a puppy, you need to start nail trims and toothbrushing early to train them to allow you to do it. Practicing with your puppy when it's young will make it easier to groom your dog when it's an adult.
Don’t use regular toothpaste to brush your dog’s teeth because it may contain ingredients that are harmful to dogs. You can find toothpaste for dogs in the pet supply section of your local department store or at a pet supply store.
Using an electric grinder or hand file instead of clippers reduces the risk of cutting too much nail off, which can cause pain or bleeding.
If you can hear clicking when your dog walks, it’s due for a clipping. Its nails should rest at or just above the floor so the dog doesn’t have to put too much weight on the backs of its paws.

Brush the dog regularly.,
Bathe the dog sparingly.,
Brush the dog's teeth.,
Trim the dog's nails.",How to Care for an Akita Inu Dog2," The Akita Inu's coat is short and stiff and needs to be brushed regularly. About once a week is adequate for most of the year.The breed sheds heavily twice a year, so be prepared to spend extra time grooming your dog during these seasons.
When selecting a brush for your Akita Inu at the pet store, look for one that is appropriate for the dog's double coat. Generally, a slicker brush or a flexible pin brush works well for dogs with a double coat.For most the year (i.e. when the dog is not shedding), pick the same day of the week and time of day to brush your dog. The Akita Inu has an excellent internal clock and will quickly come to recognize brushing as a ""fact of life"" if you are consistent. This goes double if you can start this regimen when the dog is still a puppy., The Akita Inu's hair contains heavy oils that are necessary for repelling water. Take care not to strip these healthy oils from the coat by bathing too often.Additionally, Akita Inu dogs will lick themselves clean like a cat. This keeps the dog clean and eliminates odors, making frequent bathing unnecessary.
A bath every three to four months is typically adequate. Of course, if your dog plays in the mud or otherwise gets very filthy, a bath is in order, even if it has had one fairly recently.

, The Akita Inu requires regular tooth brushing. Buy a dog toothbrush and toothpaste and clean its teeth twice a week. As best as you are able, brush the dog's teeth just as you would brush your own.Failing to do this can result in periodontal disease, bad breath, and discomfort when your dog eats.
Your local pet store should carry toothbrushes and toothpaste for dogs. If need be, do some trial and error to find a flavor your dog likes. Never use human dental products on a dog. Human toothpaste, in particular, can sicken a dog., These dogs need their nails trimmed once a month. Starting this regimen when the Akita Inu is still a puppy will make it more cooperative when it's time to trim.It is very easy to accidentally cut a dog's nails too short, cutting into the quick. This causes bleeding and discomfort for your dog. To begin with, cut off only very small parts of the nail, until you get a better sense of what you are doing.Pet stores sell special nail cutters for pets with a guard built in that prevents cutting off a large amount by accident.
If you are unable or unwilling to handle this yourself (e.g. because the dog is uncooperative or you are worried about cutting too much), have a professional groomer cut your dog's nails.

"
Establish dominance.,
Socialize the dog with children.,
Deal with mouthing.,
Exercise the dog regularly to avoid behavioral problems.,
Keep the dog stimulated and social.,
Be wary of aggression toward other dogs.",How to Care for an Akita Inu Dog3," The Akita Inu can be a willful, even stubborn dog. if you want it to obey and respect you, you must establish your dominance over it early. Otherwise, it can become aggressive and disrespectful.Teach your Akita Inu to sit, stay, and come, providing it a treat when it does these tasks correctly. Do not treat the dog until it obeys your command. Require it to carry out one of these tasks before you give it a meal. This establishes that you are in control of the dog's food.
Because this breed of dog is very willful, you should expect this training process to take a bit longer than it would with some other breeds. The key is persistence, consistency, and patience.
Get other people involved in this training process. That way, the dog understands that you, and others, are dominant.

, Children should also be involved in this training process if they are about 10-12 years old or older, commanding the dog to do treats and rewarding it for success.Younger children should be involved in feeding the dog and entering and exiting the home with it so they are not seen as subordinate by the Akita Inu.
Children should be told to be kind and gentle to the dog, and to avoid loud noises or sudden motions when the dog is first being socialized. This reduces the risk of the dog being spooked or hurt by the children and responding aggressively.
With particularly boisterous children, especially those that may not live in the same house as the dog, it is best to keep the Akita Inu on a leash when it first begins interacting with children.Akita Inu puppies are sometimes frightened of children. If you get a puppy, introduce the children gradually, letting the dog come to them when it is ready, and supervising all interactions between the child and the dog., The Akita Inu has a tendency toward ""mouthing,"" i.e. putting its moth around your wrist, hand, or arm. This is not the same as biting, but is troubling to some owners.Mouthing is not an aggressive act, and some Akita Inu owners find it endearing.
If you don't like this behavior, give the dog a task that involves carrying something. Akita Inu dogs are decent retrievers and can be trained to get your newspaper or slippers for you.

, The Akita Inu is an active dog. It can live well in a small space, provided it gets plenty of exercise. If it does not, it will develop behavioral problems, possibly becoming destructive.It is recommended that the dog be given two long walks (i.e. about 30 minutes) every day.If you have a yard the dog can run in at will, this is ideal, but not necessary. Do not lock the dog out in the yard if it wants to come in.
Don't overdo it. Prolonged periods outside on hot days can cause stress and illness for your dog. Do not force it to spend too much time in direct summer sun, especially when exercising., The Akita Inu is an intelligent and social animal. It will want to spend time with you and your family, and it will need varied playful activities to stay happy.Give your Akita Inu plenty of affection, and make sure it has toys to play with and carry around the house.
Long periods solitary inactivity in your home are more likely to promote destructive behavior. The Akita Inu is active and intelligent and will make up activities if it becomes bored. This might include trying to dig a hole in the floor or chew through the leg of a chair.

, The Akita Inu can be aggressive toward other dogs, especially those of the same sex.It is not advisable to walk them off leash.


Because of this trait, the Akita Inu is best suited to a one-dog household. It may also chase cats and other pets.
If your Akita Inu appears hostile toward another dog, do your best to keep it away. If you cannot, and the dogs fight, grab your dog's back legs. Have another person grab the other dog's back legs, and back them away from each other as if each dog were a wheelbarrow."

Be vigilant for signs of bloat.,
Look for signs of autoimmune hypothyroidism.,
Watch for hip and leg problems.,
Recognize other disease symptoms.,
Take your Akita Inu to the vet regularly.",How to Care for an Akita Inu Dog4," The Akita Inu is one of the most susceptible breeds when it comes to bloat, a painful and often fatal twisting of the stomach.Bloat is more likely to occur when a dog eats too fast or exercises too soon after eating.
Signs of bloat include agitation, vomiting, refusing to drink, and swelling in the torso. If you suspect bloat, take your dog to an emergency veterinary clinic. Bloat can kill a dog in few hours., A full 65 percent of Akita Inu dogs experience thyroid problems, which can affect the dog's ability to fight off disease. Get your dog checked for autoimmune hypothyroidism if you notice any of the following:Seizures
Hyperactivity
Severe and sudden weight loss
Weakness
Severe and rapid weight gain
Sudden aggressive behavior
Skin problems

, Akita Inu dogs are susceptible to hip dysplasia and luxating patella. These are both joint problems of the leg. Predisposition to these conditions is hereditary, and they may be brought on by jumping from too great a height or gaining too much weight. Seek care if you note the following:Limping or favoring other legs
Yelping in pain whenever the dog makes a particular motion
Yelping when being picked up in a particular way
Running with an odd hopping motion

, While less common, there are other health conditions that can affect the Akita Inu. Take your dog to the vet if you note the following:Nosebleeds, easy bruising, and blood in the stood or urine can be a sign of Von Willebrand's disease.
A tilt to one side, balance problems, or walking in circles can be a sign of Vestibular Syndrome.
A rusty discoloration to the dogs coat can indicate it is getting too much sun, which can be harmful to the dogs internal organs.
Dry, scaly skin and hair loss on the head, neck, and back can be a sign of sebaceous adenitis.

, Even if you don't notice any health problems, your Akita Inu, like any dog, requires regular trips to the vet. Bring your dog at least once a year for a full checkup.When visiting the vet, make sure to ask about any unusual behaviors, whether the dog is up to date on its shots, whether it is a healthy weight, and if it needs any additional dental care.If you've seen any signs of the health problems described above, always be sure to mention this.
Expect to spend, on average, several hundred dollars a year on veterinary care, and budget appropriately.If the dog has severe health problems, and when the dog becomes older, costs will increase, so it's a good idea to have an emergency fund set aside as well, unless you have pet insurance.

Feed your dog a set amount of medium-protein kibble.,
Feed your Mastiff twice a day.,
Avoid raised bowls.,
Give your pet constant access to water.",How to Care for an English Mastiff2," English Mastiffs grow so rapidly that it’s actually not a good idea to give them a high-protein diet or any extra nutritional supplements. From the time that they’re three months and older, feed them a high-quality complete and balanced adult dry dog food with a medium fat- and protein-content.Check the package to see that it’s an ideal food for your Mastiff. It should have roughly 20-25% protein and 12-18% fat. It should also include the recommended daily doses of phosphorus and calcium, plus a 3-5% iodine content.
The amount you feed your dog will vary according to its age, weight, and condition. Look to the specific guidelines suggested on your dog food’s packaging to calculate the appropriate daily serving.
Always limit your Mastiff’s meals to the recommended serving sizes indicated on the back of your dog food. Keep in mind that Mastiffs have comparatively slow metabolisms, and larger dogs need to eat much less food per pound than smaller ones.

, Create established mealtimes at morning and night, and split their daily food allowance evenly between them. This will aid your dog’s digestion and prevent it from eating too much too quickly, which puts them at greater risk of bloat., Since they’re so far off the ground, it might be tempting to raise your English Mastiff’s food bowls off the ground, too. However, the limited studies that have been done show that this practice increases their risk of bloat. Stick to a large food dish that’s on the ground.Consider getting a specialized bowl with raised partitions inside that encourages your English Mastiff to eat slower. This will decrease their risk of vomiting and bloat.

, English Mastiffs need clean, fresh water to keep their digestive systems and joints healthy. They also drool a lot, so they need to replace the water they lose through salivating. Consequently, Mastiffs are an especially thirsty breed who should always have a dish of water available to them, even at night.Because Mastiffs tend to drool into their water, be sure to rinse their dish on a daily basis. If you don’t, they’ll get dehydrated since they’re averse to drinking their own drool.

Keep your English Mastiff indoors.,
Socialize your pet early.,
Introduce them to children early.,
Train your Mastiff.,
Give your Mastiff moderate exercise.",How to Care for an English Mastiff3," Their breed is particularly social and attached to their humans, so they’ll be happiest when they’re near you. They should be kept as house dogs or not kept at all.As long as they can live amongst you, Mastiffs will be clean and undemanding pets.

, Much of a dog’s behaviors and attitudes towards humans and other animals are formed when they’re still a puppy. The sooner you can start socializing them by introducing them to new people and places, the better, especially since their large size will make them seem especially threatening should they exhibit any aggression.Make an effort to thoughtfully and gradually expand their knowledge of the world. Take them to a few new places each week, and introduce them to a few new people and dogs in each place.
Young Mastiffs are prone to phobias, so try to make sure that their experiences of new people, places, and things are as positive as possible. Don’t take them to a crowded rock concert that’s bound to be frightening. If you do encounter something that scares them, respond with calm affection and reassurance until they are at ease.

, In spite of their size, English Mastiffs can be great family pets who are excellent companions for children. However, to ensure that they’ll take to youngsters, it’s best to make sure they become accustomed to kids while they’re still puppies themselves.Be sure to prepare children for their introduction and supervise it closely. Teach children to be “dog-friendly” before they interact with your Mastiff; that is, calm, gentle, and respectful. Mastiffs can be easily traumatized by rough-housing or abuse, but they’re generally very child-friendly.

, The last thing that you want is a 150-pound dog who won’t listen to you. To make your enormous pet manageable, you should teach it at least five basic commands: sit, stay, lie down, heel, and come. The easiest and most effective way to instill these commands is to enroll your pup in formal obedience classes put on by a local kennel club, humane society, or experienced professional trainer.Repetition and positive rewards (like treats and affectionate praise) are the best ways of reinforcing commands and desirable behaviors with your Mastiff. They’re a sensitive breed and will respond to negativity with stubbornness, so be sure to keep your training attitude friendly and excited.English Mastiffs are not the most trainable breed, but if you’re consistent, patient, and firm, they will eventually catch on. Since they’re especially sensitive and don’t have the longest attention span, it’s best to reinforce commands with short training sessions several times a day., Your English Mastiff should be exercised daily with a walk to keep them physically and mentally sound. However, because they have a tendency to overheat, you should build up the amount of exercise they do gradually, and be sure to let them rest when they begin to pant a lot or show other signs of tiredness. Keep in mind that their weight means that athletic activities like running are much higher-impact for them than they would be for smaller dogs.Because their large frames are susceptible to joint issues, you should avoid excessive exercise or over-exerting your Mastiff, especially when they’re under two years old since their skeletons are still developing.
One of the best exercises for young Mastiffs is swimming in a pool, pond, lake, bay, or other calm body of water. If the weather permits, it’s a great way to develop your dog’s muscles without putting undue strain on their joints. Be sure to always supervise their swimming sessions, and keep them to 10-30 minutes a day."

Brush their coat at least once a week.,
Clean their wrinkles.,
Bathe them infrequently.,
Clip their nails every week or two.,
Brush their teeth often.",How to Care for an English Mastiff4," English Mastiffs have a short, low-maintenance coat that should not require much grooming. However, they do shed quite a bit, especially in the fall and spring. Use a rubber curry brush to comb them daily at the most or weekly at the least to control their shedding and remove any dirt or mats in their fur., Mastiffs have deeply wrinkled faces, and bacteria can sometimes hide in the crevices. Wipe their wrinkles at least once a week with a baby wipe and then towel them dry to prevent any potential infections., English Mastiffs are a naturally clean breed who should not require much extra attention. Frequent washing dries out a Mastiff’s skin and compromises the natural oils in their coats, so they should only be bathed when necessary. Use a mild, hypoallergenic dog shampoo to lather up your pooch from the neck down, and rinse with warm water.
Because of the logistical difficulties involved with bathing such a large beast, you may want to consider taking them to a professional groomer to do the job for you. Keep in mind that the rates will usually be higher for Mastiffs because of their size.

, Use a large clipper especially designed for dogs to trim your Mastiff’s toenails on a regular basis. Go paw by paw, starting with the ones in front. Be sure that your dog stands still while you do it.Always look at the underside of your dog’s toenail before you clip it to see where their nerve ends. You should only trim off the part that extends beyond the nerve, and always err on the side of leaving too much rather than painfully cutting your pooch’s nerve endings.

, Brush daily if possible, or 2-3 times a week at minimum. This will prevent bad breath, tartar buildup, and bacterial infections. Be sure to use a brush and toothpaste that are made especially for large dogs."

Bathe regularly.,
Care for your dog's teeth.,
Provide fresh water.,
Make sure it gets regular exercise.,
Socialize your dog early.",How to Care for Chinese Crested Dogs2," Bathe your Chinese Crested dog either once a week, or every 10 to 15 days. Use a mild, hypoallergenic dog shampoo to bathe your dog. When bathing your dog, make sure the water, as well as the bathing area, is warm. If not, your dog might become cold and start to shiver. Make sure to dry it well after the bath, and keep it warm. For example, put a sweater on your dog to keep it warm. Put the sweater on only after your dog is fully dry.Apply a mild, non-scented lotion afterwards to prevent the skin from drying. Use a mild dog lotion. If not, use a mild, baby lotion on your Chinese Crested dog.
Always bathe your dog after a long day in the sun to remove all the sunscreen. If you leave the sunscreen on, it can clog your dog’s pores and cause acne., Any dog needs good oral hygiene to prevent gum disease and loose or missing teeth later in life. Brush your dog's teeth and gums regularly, or use alternative treatments such as water additives or an oral hygiene spray for dogs.


Take your dog to the veterinarian’s office for regular dental check-ups as well.

, Keep fresh water readily available. By keeping it readily available, you can keep your dog hydrated. Hydration will keep your dog’s skin and teeth healthy.Change out the water frequently; at least once a day. Water that is stagnant and unclean can lead to more dental and skin problems.

, Because Chinese Crested dogs are small, 30 minutes to an hour of exercise per day is all it needs. Take your dog to the park, walk it around the block, or play fetch with it in the backyard.Keep your dog leashed until you have trained it to come promptly when called, even at a dog park.
Avoid using an extending leash, as this teaches the dog to pull. You can also train your dog to walk on a leash with good behavior.

, Early and frequent socialization will help you build a confident dog that has a stable temperament. Expose your dog to many different environments, people, and animals when they are young. If not, your dog might be timid or fearful around new people and dogs. Also, begin training your dog early with reward-based methods. Chinese Crested dogs do not respond well to negative reinforcement.Take your dog to the dog park frequently to help it get used to being around other dogs and people.

Introduce them slowly to children and pets.,
Provide a yard.,
Buy your cattle dog plenty of toys.,
Take them to the vet.",How to Care for an Australian Cattle Dog1," Cattle dogs can learn to live with children and pets, but they should be given time and space to adjust. When you first bring your cattle dog home, separate them from other animals and children with a baby gate. This will allow the other pets to get used to their presence and smell before they are left alone with one another.


Cattle dogs may have an instinct to chase or herd your cat. While many do live successfully with cats, always make sure that your cat has somewhere in the house to escape to where the dog cannot reach them. Supervise your cattle dog and your cat for the first few weeks. If your dog tries to mouth or chase the cat, distract them with a toy.If you have another dog in the house, you should introduce them outside while they are both leashed. Slowly walk them towards one another, and if they do not react aggressively, you can try taking them on a walk side by side. Inside the house, you may need to keep them separate for the first few weeks.
Always teach your children how to properly act around a dog. You may notice your cattle dog trying to herd your children, especially if your children are running around.;
, If you are adopting a cattle dog, you will need to provide a fenced yard for them to play in. Cattle dogs are an extremely high energy dog, and daily walks are not sufficient to exercise them. In a small home or apartment, the dog may grow restless and misbehave.

, Australian Cattle Dogs need mental as well as physical stimulation. Toys can provide both, keeping your cattle dog busy and out of trouble. Good toys include chew toys, food puzzles, stuffed animals, balls, Frisbees, rope toys, and rawhide bones., You should have a reliable vet who can screen your cattle dog for health problems and provide routine care and checkups. When you first adopt your cattle dog, make sure that they have all of their vaccinations. Certain health problems are more common in Australian Cattle Dogs, and you should be prepared to care for your dog if these develop.


Hip dysplasia is a deformity that can cause arthritis and joint disease in dogs.Patellar luxation is a dislocation of the kneecap. Surgery may be required to treat it.Portosystemic shunts is caused by a deformity of the blood vessels in the liver. It can cause growth problems, seizures, or strange behaviors such as circling or head pressing. This is a congenital problem that can be treated with diet, medication, or surgery.Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) causes the dog to gradually lose their sight. It is a genetic disease.Genetic deafness can also occur.Unless you are seriously considering breeding your purebred Australian Cattle Dog, you should also have them spayed or neutered.

Make sure your dog gets at least one to two hours of daily exercise.,
Vary your dog’s activities.,
Be aware of overexertion.,
Train your dog to give it mental exercise.",How to Care for an Irish Setter1," Irish Setters are active dogs and need at least one brisk, 30 to 60 minute walk per day. In addition to walks, it’s important to play fetch and other energetic games frequently, since Irish Setters were bred as hunting dogs.If you’re thinking about getting an Irish Setter, make sure you live an active lifestyle. If you’re looking for a more relaxed or lap dog, consider finding another breed.
Irish Setters do best if their owners have a good sized yard and ample space. If you live in an apartment, make sure you have the time and energy to give your dog the exercise it needs.
Since it’s such a high energy breed, Irish Setters need to spend lots of time with their owners. If they spend several hours or more by themselves, they can be prone to destructive behavior or separation anxiety.;
, When you take your Irish Setter for walks, switch up the route to expose your dog to different sights and smells. Take it hiking, swimming, to dog parks, and do other special activities as often as possible. If you have a yard, try hiding treats and toys in spots where it’s okay for your dog to dig.Like other energetic, intelligent breeds, Irish Setters love new or different activities and exercises. They can get bored and become mischievous if they do the same thing every day.

, Irish Setters, especially younger dogs, will often let out a big, quick burst of energy when playing, then suddenly get tired. When you’re playing or out and about, try not to push your dog if it needs to rest for a minute.Irish Setter puppies in particular will let out lots of energy then get tired. In addition, their joints are still forming, so take special care not to overexert your Irish Setter puppy by jogging or running for long periods of time.
Since they mature slowly, be aware that Irish Setters still act like puppies or juveniles and quickly wear themselves out even past two or three years old.
Fenced dog parks or yards are great options, since they let your dog play and rest as it feels the need.

, Intelligent dogs like Irish Setters benefit from obedience training. They do best when their owner is their alpha, and need lots of mental stimulation to keep them from becoming bored or mischievous.Teach your dog command words, like sit, come, and heel. Say the word, then physically guide the dog to help it do the command when you’re first starting out. Give it a treat as soon as it’s in the correct position, and repeat the process ten to twenty times so it becomes automatic.
Since they have relatively short attention spans, keep training sessions short, fun, and positive. They will become easily distracted and less trainable after fifteen or twenty minutes."

Be firm and consistent when training your Dalmatian.",How to Care for a Dalmatian," Among dog breeds, Dalmatians are uniquely susceptible to developing stones in their urinary tracts, a condition called urolithiasis. Protein can contribute to the development of these stones, so it is a good idea to limit the amount of protein and purines in your Dalmatian’s diet.Purines are a substance that, when not metabolized properly, contribute to the formation of urate crystals in your Dalmatian’s urinary tract.
Your veterinarian can assist you in determining which low-protein diet would be best for your Dalmatian. In fact, he or she may recommend that you feed your Dalmatian a low-protein diet only if he starts developing urinary problems.Dalmatians are also prone to allergies. Avoid multi-colored foods, since they have additives that could cause or aggravate your Dalmatian’s allergies.;
, If you have a Dalmatian puppy, feed him 3 times a day. Allow a few hours between his last meal and his bedtime to give him time to digest his food before going to sleep for the night.Remember that he will need to go to the bathroom 45 minutes after he eats.


When your puppy is 14 to 16 weeks old, start feeding him twice a day—once in the morning and once in the evening.Follow the feeding instructions on the food label to determine how much you should feed your puppy per day.
Your adult Dalmatian should eat 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dog food per day, split between two meals.Dalmatians tend to eat quickly, and, if given the chance, would eat to their heart’s content. It is better for Dalmatians to have designated feeding times, rather than being allowed to eat free choice., Since Dalmatians are prone to developing urinary stones, they need to drink water constantly to flush out their urinary system. Whether your Dalmatian is in a crate or can roam your house freely, make sure he has plenty of water to drink.Given how much water your Dalmatian has to drink, he may need to urinate more frequently.

, Dalmatians are athletic and full of energy. Without an outlet for all of that energy, Dalmatians can become bored and destructive.Make time each day to exercise and play with your Dalmatian. Not only will he be able to release all of the pent-up energy, but he will also get some much-needed attention from you.


Allot at least 30 minutes of daily exercise with your Dalmatian.For puppies, break the total exercise time into smaller segments to allow for rest., Your Dalmatian is no slouch—he would love to go on a long-distance run, hike through the woods, or even take a long swim.If you enjoy vigorous activity, then a Dalmatian is a great dog for you!


If you have a puppy, wait until he is about 18 months old before taking him for a run. A puppy’s joints need time to develop, and engaging him in vigorous activity before his body is fully developed can lead to injury and orthopedic problems.Dalmatians also do well in dog performance events, such as Agility, Coursing and Tracking.Training for these events would be great exercise for your Dalmatian.
Your Dalmatian wouldn’t mind some lower-energy activities too, such as a casual stroll., There are many playful activities to keep your Dalmatian physically active. Whichever activity you choose, make sure it allows you to have quality one-on-one time with him.For example, play fetch with your Dalmatian.Teaching your Dalmatian new tricks is another great way to play with him. Teach him tricks like playing dead, grabbing paw, and rolling over.
If you have an enclosed backyard, consider creating an obstacle course for him to jump over and run through things.Your Dalmatian has a sense of humor, so don’t be surprised if he comes up with things to make you laugh.He may come up with a trick on his own, just to see you laugh!
Don’t forget to give your Dalmatian plenty of toys to play with.

, When your Dalmatian is a puppy, you will need to take him to the veterinarian regularly to for vaccination and deworming (removing intestinal parasites). Your puppy should start receiving his vaccinations at around 6 weeks of age. Deworming starts at 2 weeks of age and continues every 2 weeks until he is 12 weeks old.Although there are core vaccinations your puppy should receive (e.g., rabies, parvovirus), your veterinarian may recommend other vaccinations based on where you live.If your Dalmatian has urinary issues, you will need to take him to the veterinarian regularly to have his urine checked for crystals.
If your Dalmatian is in good health, once or twice yearly veterinary visits should be sufficient.

, As a Dalmatian owner, you will need to pay close attention to his urinary health. If you notice your Dalmatian having trouble urinating, or if you see blood in his urine, take him to your veterinarian for further examination.In addition to feeding your Dalmatian a low-protein diet and giving him plenty of fresh water to drink, you may also need to give him a medication called allopurinol.


Allopurinol can reduce the accumulation of urate, thus preventing the formation of urate crystals.Allopurinol’s effectiveness is variable, though, so your veterinarian will need to check your Dalmatian’s urine for urate crystals on a regular basis.Urinary stones are more common in males., Dalmatians can develop different types of skin allergies (e.g., food, contact, inhalant). Many times, removing the source of the allergy is sufficient treatment. For example, a food allergy can be treated by eliminating the ingredient causing the allergy. If a certain type of topical flea medication were causing a contact allergy, then you would try a different medication.If your Dalmatian develops a skin allergy, his skin will look red and may have some red bumps., Dalmatians’ genetics make them susceptible to deafness, either in both ears or in one ear. About 8% of Dalmatians are born completely deaf, and 22 to 24% are deaf in one ear at birth.Even if you suspect deafness in your Dalmatian, it would be a good idea to have him professionally tested using the Brainstem Auditory Evoked Response (BAER) test.This test is performed in Dalmatian puppies that are at least 5 weeks old.If your veterinarian does not perform this test, he or she can recommend a facility where you can have it performed. If you purchased your Dalmatian puppy from a breeder, ask the breeder if the puppy has been BAER tested.
Do not stomp your feet or bang on something to test your Dalmatian’s hearing. Even though he would not be able to hear the loud noise, he would be able to feel the vibrations., With black spots on a white coat, Dalmatians have a distinctive look that’s easy to love. Do not be too smitten by your Dalmatian’s good looks, though. Your Dalmatian will shed—a lot. In fact, Dalmatians shed year-round. To manage the shedding, brush your Dalmatian once a week.There are a few different grooming tools you can use. Curry combs and slicker brushes work well at removing dead hair.A medium-soft rubber curry brush is another good grooming tool.Grooming gloves are also available.Brushing your Dalmatian’s coat is a good way to bond with him., In addition to brushing your Dalmatian, you will also need to trim his nails, brush his teeth, and clean his ears. Dalmatian nails to tend be very strong, so you may need to use a little extra force to trim his nails without splitting them.Guillotine-style nail clippers are good for trimming dog nails.
Trim your Dalmatian’s nails once or twice a month. Take him to your veterinarian or groomer if you are unable to trim the nails on your own.
Brush his teeth with dog-specific toothpaste 2 to 3 times/week.It is best to start brushing his teeth when he is a puppy so he can become comfortable with the process.
If your Dalmatian’s ears are smelly, or have a buildup of wax or debris, it is time to clean them. Using an ear cleaning solution recommended by your veterinarian, put some drops of the solution into his ear, hold his ear closed, and massage his ear. Next, let your dog shake his head and use a piece of clean tissue to wipe his ear., Fortunately, you will not have to bathe your Dalmatian nearly as often as you brush him. Dalmatians are very clean dogs and have very little ‘doggy’ odor. Three to four baths a year should be sufficient for your Dalmatian.Since Dalmatians can develop skin allergies, bathe your Dalmatian with a dog-specific shampoo for sensitive skin.A conditioner is not necessary, but can be helpful if your Dalmatian has dry skin.Your Dalmatian could develop a skin reaction with a new shampoo.Be cautious when switching shampoos.

, The earlier you start training your Dalmatian the better, even if it isn’t formal obedience training. Dalmatians are very eager to please, and, as puppies, will start to look to their owners for approval or disapproval. For example, if your Dalmatian is chewing your shoes, redirect him towards chewing a bone to let him know that chewing your shoes is not acceptable.Since Dalmatians like to see just how much they can get away with, start teaching your Dalmatian from an early age about what is appropriate and what is not., When you first bring your Dalmatian puppy home, take him outside once every 1.5 hours so he can relieve himself. It would also help to set up a consistent schedule for taking your puppy outside. For example, take him out 15 minutes after he drinks water and 45 minutes after he eats.With a set schedule of going outside, your Dalmatian puppy will be less likely to go the bathroom inside.
Your puppy should be housetrained by about 16 to 18 weeks of age.Although it may be tempting to rely on puppy pee pads for housetraining, your puppy should learn to relieve himself outside.
Reward your puppy for going to the bathroom outside, but do not punish or scold him if he has an accident inside. The punishment will only encourage him to go to the bathroom in the house when you’re not looking., Dalmatians do not enjoy spending time a lot of time by themselves, and could become destructive if left to their own devices for long periods of time.If you work outside of the home, and do not want it to look like a disaster zone when you return, consider crate training your Dalmatian. When done properly, crate training will help him see his crate as a place of refuge and safety, rather than confinement or punishment.


Dalmatians can also become bored easily, so you may not want your Dalmatian to have free reign of your house to relieve that boredom.With crate training, you will make the crate comfortable with treats, toys, and blankets, and encourage your Dalmatian to spend longer and longer periods of time in the crate. Eventually, he will go in the crate willingly and enjoy his time inside of it.
Since puppies cannot control their bladders very well, limit your puppy’s crate time to 2 to 3 hours at a time until he’s 6 months old. Beyond 6 months, he can stay in the crate for 6 to 8 hours.Adult Dalmatians can stay crated for 8 to 10 hours.Since Dalmatians are prone to developing urinary stones, provide your Dalmatian with plenty of fresh water while he is in the crate., A puppy kindergarten class is a great way to teach your Dalmatian puppy important socialization skills that will help him mature into a well-rounded adult dog. With early socialization, your Dalmatian will learn how to interact appropriately with other dogs, which will be helpful if you have other dogs.Puppy kindergarten will also expose your Dalmatian to new situations and experiences. Dalmatians do not always adapt well to new situations, so puppy kindergarten will teach your Dalmatian how to handle something new in his environment.Outside of puppy kindergarten, you can introduce your puppy to new people and experiences at home and when you take him out on walks.
Without early socialization, your Dalmatian could become very possessive of you and your household, making him unfriendly towards strangers.When your puppy gets older, enroll him in obedience training where he can learn such basic skills as sitting, staying, and walking on a leash.

, Historically, Dalmatians were trained to be guard dogs. In addition, Dalmatians tend to be very protective of their households.If you want to feel more protected in your home, train your Dalmatian to be a guard dog.


Make sure you understand the difference between a guard dog and an attack dog. A guard dog’s main purpose is to alert you to danger. It is an attack dog that will actually attack and bite the intruder.As a guard dog, your Dalmatian will learn how to give an ‘alert bark’ that will let you know when danger is nearby.

, In addition to being eager to please, Dalmatians love attention and will respond well to positive attention from you (e.g., treats, extra petting, verbal praise).In fact, positive reinforcement could be considered one of the best training tools you can use for a Dalmatian.Do not ever abuse or yell at your Dalmatian. Dalmatians are very perceptive dogs, and may not easily forget being mistreated.Mistreatment could lead to future behavioral problems.

, Despite being eager to please, Dalmatians can be very headstrong when it comes to training.Along with the positive reinforcement, you will need to be very firm and consistent when giving your Dalmatian commands. If he doesn’t think that you mean business, he will continue to push the boundaries to see just how much he can get away with.


The more firm and consistent you are with your training, the more your Dalmatian will respect and trust you as his leader.

Wash new bedding and clothing before use.,
Buy safe chew toys.,
Store household cleaners in high places.",How to Care for Chinese Crested Dogs3," New clothing, bedding, and home furnishings often contain harmful chemicals, like formaldehyde, that can irritate your Chinese Crested’s skin. Therefore, always wash new clothing and bedding, which will be used by your dog, before use.When washing clothing and bedding, use a pet-friendly, non-toxic detergent, like Soap Nuts Laundry Liquid or Nellie’s All-Natural Laundry Detergent.

, Buy chew toys for your Chinese Crested dog that are the right size. Your dog should not be able to fit the whole toy in its mouth. If it can, then it is too small.Do not buy toys with small parts that your dog can choke on, or toys with foam stuffing.
Buy chew toys made with softer materials, like soft rubber, since the Chinese Crested’s teeth are so fragile.

, Since Chinese Crested dogs are small and low to the ground, store your common household cleaners in high places, i.e., at or above eye level. Common household cleaners, like all-purpose cleaners, detergents, and glass and wood cleaners, emit harmful vapors that your dog can breathe in.


You can also store these cleaners in the garage."

You can make your cattle dog work for their food. This will keep them busy and provide stimulation. Hide your dog’s food around the house and make them hunt for it. You can also put food or treats inside food puzzle toys.You should also have a water bowl set out for them. Make sure that there is always clean, fresh water available, and change the water daily. If you live somewhere hot, you may even want to set a bowl outside for your dog.

, Australian Cattle Dogs have a double coat that repels dirt. You only need to brush the dog once a week with a bristle or slicker brush. Twice a year, when the dog is shedding, you may have to brush more frequently. Cattle dogs only need to be bathed when they have become visibly dirty.Check your dog’s ears often for signs of ear wax. If your dog is pawing at their ears or whining when you touch their ears, you may want to have them checked out by a vet.
You should trim your dog’s nails regularly. If the dog’s nails are tapping against the floor, they are too long.

, Australian Cattle Dogs are known to be especially close to their owners, but this means that they are susceptible to separation anxiety. Cattle dogs should not be left alone or confined for long periods of time.If you work during the day, you may want to see if a dog sitter, friend, or family member can visit the dog while you’re at work. You might also consider coming home during your lunch break.

Enroll your dog in an obedience class.,
Teach them basic commands.,
Socialize them while they are young.,
Discourage mouthing or nipping.",How to Care for an Australian Cattle Dog3," Australian cattle dogs are highly intelligent dogs, and they require consistent and strong leadership to be trained. If you do not enforce consistent rules in the household, the dog may misbehave. Obedience classes can help teach you how to keep your cattle dog in line while teaching them basic rules.


For puppies, there are special classes that will instruct them from a young age. No puppy is too young to begin training, although many training schools will require your puppy to have certain vaccinations before they can attend.
For working cattle dogs, lessons with an experienced cattle dog trainer is advised.
Some people find that clicker training works well with cattle dogs., Certain basic commands will help you communicate with your cattle dog. These commands include “sit,” “come,” “lay down, and “stay.” Show your dog the proper behavior, and reward them when they successfully do it. Soon they will associate the word with the command.If you are training a working dog, you may also need to teach them special commands such as “come by,” “away to me,” and “look back.”For cattle dogs, the ability to herd is instinctual, and they may only need commands to make them perform certain actions.

, Cattle dogs are extremely loyal to their families, but they can be shy or aggressive towards strangers. As early as possible, expose your cattle dog to strangers and other animals.


Take your cattle dog on as many car trips as you can. This will let them experience a variety of sights, sounds, smells, and people in a safe environment.Leashed walks can also help your cattle dog grow used to other people and animals.
Once your cattle dog has been exposed to a few other dogs without incident, you can try taking them to a dog park, where they can run and play with other dogs.
While cattle dogs can be very protective and loyal to children in their family, they may not react well to stranger’s children., Australian Cattle Dogs have an instinct to nip livestock as they herd them. In a household, this means that your cattle dog may try to mouth you. While this is natural behavior, you should discourage it.When your cattle dog nips you, say “no” and walk away. Ignore them for a few minutes before returning. They will soon learn that nipping is a bad behavior.


If your dog starts mouthing you, give them a chew toy instead. This will teach them to get their urges out on the toy and not on you.Do not hit or yell at your dog for nipping. By responding aggressively to natural behavior, you are only teaching them to fear you.

"
"
Play with them.,
Take them for long walks.,
Let them run off the leash.,
Take them to an agility class.",How to Care for an Australian Cattle Dog4," Interactive games are important to helping your cattle dog get rid of their excess energy. Such games increase the bond between you and your dog, and they are an important part of the socialization process. Some good games you can play include:


Hide and seek
Fetch
Catch with a Frisbee
Tug-of-War

, Your cattle dog needs plenty of exercise. While some breeds will be content with one or two walks around the block, cattle dogs need long walks at least once or twice a day.This will help make your cattle dog nice and tired, preventing them from getting bored or mischievous.


If you are a runner, you might consider taking your cattle dog on a run with you. This is a great way to get the proper amount of exercise for your dog.

, While leashed walks are important, your cattle dog should have the opportunity to run off the leash as well. In a fenced yard or park, let them run and play freely. They may enjoy playing with other dogs at a dog park or merely playing alone in their backyard.

, Agility classes offer structured games, activities, and obstacle courses that are fun for both you and your dog. Because of their natural agility and high energy, cattle dogs are ideal for agility courses.You can find local agility classes online, through your vet, or through your obedience training school.

Know breed specific health risks.,
Prevent your dog from becoming obese.,
Keep an eye out for signs of hip problems.,
Be aware that Irish Setters are at a higher risk for epilepsy.,
Be on the lookout for symptoms of bloat.",How to Care for an Irish Setter2," While Irish Setters are generally healthy dogs, they can be prone to stomach and bone cancers, hip problems, epilepsy, and other health issues. It’s important to ask your dog’s breeder if its parents were tested for genetic disorders and breed specific health problems, preferably before adopting or purchasing your dog.Screening both your dog and its parents can detect warning signs for some health issues, but make sure you also get to know your individual dog. Being familiar with your dog’s normal behavior will help you be better aware if something is wrong, especially if you don’t have access to its parents’ health records.
Taking your dog to the vet at least once a year is the most effective way to stay on top of its health. Find a good vet by contacting your local shelter or asking friends and family for referrals. You can also search online for a breed club for recommended vets. Search “Irish Setter Breed Club near” your city or county., Talk to your vet about how much food is best for your dog in order to prevent obesity. If your dog's hips become less noticeable or an exam shows that its weight has increased, take measures to improve its diet.If your dog gains weight, cut down on treats and other food you give it between meals.
One to two cups of food twice a day is generally a good amount for a medium to large sized dog, depending on its activity level. Ask your vet if decreasing a half cup will help maintain your dog's weight.
Multiple daily feedings is best for your dog's digestion and helps decrease risks of obesity and other health issues.
Look for brands marked for medium sized breeds, or for breed-specific blends. Go with the best quality brand that's affordable for you.

, Irish Setters are prone to developing a condition called hip dysplasia. It’s typically inherited, so knowing if either of your dog’s parents had it will help you maintain your dog’s health. Whether or not its parents had hip dysplasia, be on the lookout for symptoms such as limping, hesitation when jumping, and loss of thigh muscle mass.You can prevent or manage hip dysplasia by keeping an eye on your dog’s weight, avoiding overfeeding, and giving it regular exercise.
Be aware that hip dysplasia can occur at any time during a dog’s lifespan, including when it’s a puppy.

, Canine epilepsy, or frequent seizures, is an inherited trait that usually develops when a dog is between one and three years old. Signs of a possible seizure include falling over, stiffened limbs, twitching excessively, or other uncontrolled movements.If your dog seizes, take it to the vet as soon as possible. Carefully observe the seizure so you can describe symptoms in detail to the vet.

, Bloat occurs when a dog’s stomach twists, affecting blood flow and harming body systems. Irish Setters are at a higher risk than other breeds, so it’s important to be familiar with your dog’s regular behavior in order to recognize symptoms.The first signs of bloat are restlessness, anxious pacing, dry heaving or unsuccessful attempts to vomit, and stomach swelling. Give your vet a call, and take your dog for an exam immediately.
Since Irish Setters are prone to developing bloat, consider keeping a fact sheet with symptoms, action steps, and your vet’s emergency contact number handy: http://irishsetterhealth.org/files/bloat.pdf

Feeding your dog two to three smaller meals instead of one large meal can help prevent bloat.
Talk to your veterinarian about preventative surgery. Your vet may recommend gastropexy to reduce or eliminate the risk that your dog’s stomach will twist on itself in the future.

Teach your dog basic commands.,
Establish clear boundaries.,
Be consistent in your dog training.,
Try crate training.,
Socialize your dog.",How to Care for an Affenpinscher1," Teaching your dog some basic commands is an excellent way to establish your dominance, encourage your dog to be polite, and begin building a relationship with your dog. You can begin by teaching “sit,” and then move on to teaching “stay,” “lay down,” and “heel.”


Stand in front of the dog and give the verbal command.
When the dog completes the action, give them a treat and offer praise.
Wait until your dog has mastered each command before teaching them a new one.;
, Dogs are pack animals, and as such, they enjoy understanding the rules of a given situation. Decide what boundaries you would like to set for your Affenpinscher. For instance, you may not allow your dog on the furniture, or may not want them to jump on people. It will be important for you to make these rules clear, and to stay consistent with your dog.


Each time your dog does the undesired behavior, redirect their actions. (Move them off of the furniture or stop them from jumping).
Offer them praise when they do the correct action.
Avoid physical punishment or yelling.

, Affenpinschers are fun and affectionate dogs, but they are also known to be quite stubborn. It is crucial to be consistent with your dog training.Stick to a daily routine with regular feeding times, walk times, and play times.
Don’t bend the rules. If they are not meant to be on the furniture, don’t ever allow them on the furniture.
Avoid giving attention to negative behaviors. Instead, offer praise and rewards for good behaviors (positive reinforcement).

, Like other toy dog breeds, Affenpinscher dogs can be difficult to housetrain. Crate training is strongly recommended. Crate training draws on your dog’s natural instinct to find a safe den for sleeping.


Select the right crate for your dog. Your dog should be able to stand, sit, and lie down inside.
Place it in a good location. You want it to be someplace it can stay all the time.
Create a positive association. Make the crate comfortable with a soft blanket, and provide toys and/or treats that your dog enjoys. (Do not include anything that could be a choking hazard.)
Allow the dog to “find” the crate and enter it on their own. Never force the dog into the crate.
Work toward getting the dog to stay in the crate through the night. (If your dog is a puppy, give them a bathroom break every 4 hours).
Since dogs do not like to soil their “nest,” crate training is a great way to housebreak your dog.

, Affenpinschers are very friendly and sociable dogs. Frequent socialization with people and other dogs is crucial for your Affenpinscher to grow into a well-rounded dog. Allow friends and family to come over, and take your dog to a popular dog park.Expose your dog (especially a puppy) to different kinds of people. Introduce your dog to people of different ages, genders, and races. It is also good for your dog to encounter people who wear glasses or hats, or have facial hair.
Introduce your dog to other dogs. Visit the home of a friend with dogs or go to a dog park. Doing this outdoors works best.
Be patient when exposing your dog to new people or animals. Provide praise and watch for signs of stress (such as whining, growling, exposing teeth, or trying to hide).

Get the proper equipment and set aside time.,
Groom with a comb or rake first.,
Finish with a brush.,
Check for health issues while grooming.,
Bathe your Samoyed once or twice each year.,
Shampoo your dog.,
Check nails twice a month.,
Take care of your Samoyed’s teeth.",How to Care for a Samoyed1," Your Samoyed has two layers of hair: a fine undercoat keeps it warm and an outer layer of coarse hair to protects it from the weather.To maintain all of this fur, you need to comb and brush your dog several times a week with the right kinds of tools.


You will need a rake or comb with rotating teeth (to glide through the hair easily) and a pin brush with rounded ends (to prevent you from scratching your dog while grooming).;
, Use one hand to part the hair and section it. With your other hand, comb the hair in the direction of hair growth. Start at the bottom of the section you are wanting to groom and comb down in the direction of the hair growth. Keep combing each section until no more hair falls out.Because it can take a while to completely comb your Samoyed, you may want to take breaks for playtime throughout the process.
Talk to your dog throughout the combing and reassure him what a good boy he’s being.

, You can either go through all of your dog’s fur in this step, or just brush the top coat.The Samoyed breed standard calls for the outer coat to stand out from the body. If you want to do this, brush in the opposite direction of hair growth during this last step.


Only use a brush on your Samoyed’s tail, since this is a sensitive area. Hold the tip of the tail gently in one hand while brushing with the other.Samoyeds “blow” or shed their undercoats completely twice a year. During this time, brush daily to help eliminate loose, dead hair., While brushing and combing your Samoyed, check for fleas and ticks. Also, feel your dog’s body for any new lumps or bumps while grooming him. If caught early, these problems can be easily solved.

, Place a non-skid mat in the tub so your Samoyed doesn’t slip in the bath, and have plenty of towels and treats nearby. Close the door so he can’t escape. Brush your Samoyed before bathing to remove loose dead fur and to prevent knots, and place cotton balls in his ears to prevent water from entering.


Despite their stunning white coats, Samoyeds do not need to be bathed that often. Once or twice a year will suffice, unless your dog gets exceptionally muddy or dirty., After thoroughly wetting your dog, massage in shampoo from the neck down and rinse completely. Then dry with a power dryer for pets and give your Samoyed a final brushing.


Ask your vet for a recommendation for a shampoo for your dog; some suggest using a whitening pet shampoo to enhance your Samoyed’s pristine white fur.Use a washcloth to clean its face so you don’t get water in your dog’s eyes or mouth.

, Samoyed’s nails are strong and grow quickly, so they need to be trimmed regularly to avoid splitting, cracking, and overgrowth.Cut only the clear tip. The dark part that shows through the nail is a vein, and it will bleed profusely and be extremely painful for your dog if it is cut.Nails are easier to clip after soaking them or after a bath. If you aren’t comfortable cutting your Samoyed’s nails, ask your veterinarian or pet shop for a quick lesson.

, Brushing once or twice a week with a dog-specific toothpaste, and giving your dog dental chews regularly, will help prevent tartar and plague. They will also help keep your dog’s breath fresh.


Ask your veterinarian to examine your Samoyed’s teeth yearly. Your vet will be able to completely remove plague and tartar and check for loose or diseased teeth.

Consider pet insurance for your min pin.",How to Care for a Miniature Pinscher," Miniature pinschers may look physically delicate but they are mentally tough and determined. This is because they were originally bred to be working dogs tasked with the job of hunting and catching vermin, such as rats.


Consider this side of their character if you have other pets, because the min pin will believe small mammals such as pet rabbits, guinea pigs, hamster or mice are actually prey that need to be hunted down.;
, This will shape how you train it. Because the miniature pinscher is a working dog it will think for itself and make its own decisions. This can lead to problems when training the dog, unless you are either totally clear and focussed about how to train or are an experienced dog handler.


If you are a first time dog owner who wants an easy pet that you can cuddle but not invest a lot of time into training, then a min pin isn't the best dog for you.

, Most miniature pinschers have a natural guarding instinct that can make them wary of strangers. This can lead to possible behavioral issues, such as guarding the door or being territorial to visitors.


A miniature pinscher's prowess and bravery in the face of vermin also translates into this attitude to strangers. This means that if the dog feels insecure it is more likely to express that as aggression than as hiding or running away., It is also in the miniature pinscher nature to want to run free and explore. Because of this they are consummate escape artists.


The min pin is adept at dodging between your legs when you answer the door and escaping outside, so you need to be prepared for this.
If you have a yard then you need to make sure it is utterly escape proof, as a min pin will seek out the smallest gap or loose fence panel and run away., Miniature pinschers are not an ideal dog if you have very young children. This is because the dog has relatively delicate legs and if rough-housed by a boisterous child, it could result in physical harm to the dog.


Another factor is the min pin's tendency to displays of aggression should it feel threatened. Young children do not always recognize the subtle early warning signs of discomfort that dogs give off. If the child ignores the signs and approaches a fearfully aroused dog, the dog is then more likely to attack.

, Because of the miniature pinscher's suspicion of strangers, it is essential for the dog to be well-socialized as a puppy with all manner of people, dogs, and experiences. If you are getting the dog from a breeder, make sure the breeder has regularly exposed the dog to men, women, and children, and a wide variety of sights, sounds, and smells.It is also best to choose a puppy that has been raised inside the home, rather than outside in a kennel. This will assure that the pup is confident about the noises associated with a house, such as the vacuum cleaner, washing machines, TV, and the general noises people make.

, When you take your puppy home, be sure to keep up this socialization and take your new dog out and about so that it becomes confident it different situations. If the puppy is not yet fully vaccinated and cannot be put on the ground yet, then carry it under your arm or use a small pet carrier, so it can experience being alongside a busy highway or being outside a school when the children are playing.


Lack of socialization and experience can lead to an anxious dog, and in the case of the min pin, this can lead to aggressive behavior.

, These dogs need companionship. They do not do well when left alone for long periods. Make sure your dog has plenty of mental stimulation. Provide it with toys, puzzle feeders, and a stuffed KONG for times when you can't be with it.

, Older children can be taught the body language associated with warning of arousal and so are a better match than young children. Signs that a dog is increasingly outside their comfort zone and about to attack include:


The dog staring directly at the person
Excessive yawning.
Excessive lip licking.
Hunched and cowering behavior, which then becomes more upright with the head raised and weight on the forequarters.
Tail held stiffly, but may wag in a slow beat (Not all tail wagging indicates friendliness).
Raised hackles or hair on the dog's body.
Snarling, raised lips, and growling.

, The independent mind of the miniature pinscher means you need to be prepared to give firm, fair, and consistent training so that it takes you seriously. Reward-based training methods, especially clicker training is appropriate because this rewards the dog's good behavior while minimizing its levels of stress or anxiety.

, Teach it all the basic commands, such as sit, stay, and lay down. Be prepared to train your min pin twice a day for 10 - 20 minutes at a time, depending on the level of its concentration.


Always end the session on a positive note, so if its attention is wandering, give it a simple command, such as ""sit"" and reward when it does it. Then resume the session another time.

, In light of the min pin's love of running away to explore, it is vital to teach the dog to come back to you on demand. This will allow the dog to have some freedom to explore without a huge risk of it running off.


Remember the vital rule that if it gives you the run around and takes a long time to come back, never vent your frustration on the dog. To do so only teaches the dog that it is punished when it comes to you. This will make the dog less likely to listen next time., The dog should have a safe den to retreat to when strangers come in your home or when it needs alone time. Again, do this training with rewards, so treats in the open crate and feed the dog in the crate, so that it associates the crate with positive experiences.


Never use the crate as a prison or punishment for the dog, since this will stop it from thinking of it as a safe place and defeats the idea behind a crate.

, The miniature pinscher is an active dog but does have a tendency to put on weight. Taking care of your min pin means feeding it responsibly so that it is neither under or over weight.


You should be able to identify the bones of the dog's ribs by feel, without pressing fat out of the way. Likewise it should have a tucked up waist when viewed from the side, and a curve in at the waist when viewed from above.

, The food should list a named meat as the main ingredients (the first one to three ingredients on the label). Consult with your vet about good brands to feed your dog.


Don't forget to give your min pin access to water at all times. A clean source of water is important for all dogs.

, The min pin is a deep-chested breed which means it is at risk of bloat and gastric torsion, which is a life-threatening condition. To reduce the risk of GDV (Gastric dilation and torsion) always leave at least 90 minutes between feeding and exercise., The min pin has a short coat that needs minimal grooming, although regular brushing is always a good idea. It stimulates the circulation to the skin and coat, and helps condition it.


Brushing also helps bond you and the dog, promoting a strong relationship.

, The min pin's short coat and lack of body fat mean that it does feel the cold. Thus, in colder weather it will appreciate a jacket and make sure it has a warm bed to snuggle into at night.

, Being a responsible owner and caring for your miniature pinscher means having regular check ups with a veterinarian to make sure it is healthy. Annual vaccinations are also recommended, including against rabies.


Your vet can advise about which diseases are prevalent in your area, and therefore which to vaccinate against.
Also use preventative healthcare, such as parasite control and deworming, as advised by your veterinarian.

, If your dog is a pet, rather than a breeding animal, then consider desexing it. It is best to get a dog ""fixed"" before it is 6 months old.This will help eliminate the risk of some diseases, such as breast cancer in female dogs, and it will help the overall behavior of your dog, whatever its sex., They are a pedigree dog, which means there are certain genetic conditions that are statistically more likely to occur in this breed than other breeds or a mixed parentage dog. These conditions include Legge-Perthes disease (a hip problem), luxating patellas (a kneecap problem), under active thyroid glands, and epilepsy.These problems can be corrected or managed, but the costs involved can be large. Either make sure you have the financial capacity to cope with the unexpected or take out a pet insurance policy.

Consider getting your pet microchipped.",How to Care for a Maltese Dog," Maltese do like company and can bark or suffer anxiety related problems if they are left alone for long periods of time. Think about whether you can structure your day so that the Maltese is not left alone for more than 4 hours at a time.


Be aware that because Maltese like to be with people, they can easily become over-dependant on human company and suffer from stress or ""separation anxiety"" unless trained from a young age to cope in solitude. To train the dog to do this means deliberately spending small periods of time away from the dog so that it learns to be alone. Be careful not to over pamper the dog as this can make it even more difficult for it when you're not there to fuss it.Most Maltese are friendly, outgoing, and relatively fearless but because they are small (4-7 lbs) and have delicate bones, they are easily injured. As a result, they can become fearful or aggressive. Keep an eye on them around larger animals, and show children how to hold the Maltese properly without squeezing or dropping him. If you have very young children, you might want to consider a sturdier breed like a Shih Tzu, Havanese, or Bichon. ;
, Be aware that the Maltese feel the cold easily. If your home is chilly or you live in a cold environment, then reconsider your choice of dog. Also be aware they have long silky coats, which needs daily grooming and will need to have their hair trimmed regularly because Maltese do not shed like most other breeds. Although this is an added expense (unless you learn to do it yourself), the upside is that the Maltese (like the Poodle) is a relatively hypoallergenic breed., If you can't commit to such a long term undertaking, or you expect your circumstances to change, then reconsider getting a dog , especially one that can live to be 14 or 15. Adopting a dog is a long-term commitment, not something to take lightly.

, There are thousands of Maltese breeders out there, but there are also plenty of purebreds in animal shelters. If you know someone with a Maltese ask where that person got it. Make sure that before you bring your Maltese home, that it gets along with other pets or children you may have.


Make sure you see the Maltese puppy with his mother. If for whatever reason the mother is not present, walk away. This is a give away sign that the puppy is from a puppy mill and such immoral breeding programs should not be encouraged.Make sure your Maltese was socialized well as a puppy, as this helps make it become a confident outgoing adult.

, If you don't want to deal with the upkeep a shorter ""puppy cut"" looks cute on a Maltese. You will need to have him professionally groomed maybe once every six weeks but will still need to brush his hair daily using a nice, soft brush. Remove excess hair and untangle knots while the hair is dry or with a special detangler. Bathing him first will make the tangles worse.


You may need to use a comb to get to the root of any tangles and knots. Remember to gently tease them apart. Take extreme care cutting out knots, as it is all too easy to nick the skin., You may need to bathe a playful puppy once a week, while a calm, older dog will only need a monthly bath.Wash its hair like it's your own, only be very gentle! Don't forget to clean your pup's face with a washcloth.

, Maltese dogs have white hair that is prone to tear staining. You will recognize this as the brown streaks down the face of a white dog. This happens when tears overspill onto the cheek and stay there for a few hours. Substances in the tear fluid oxidizes and change to that rust-colored pigment, which causes the staining.


To avoid this, dry the area around your dog's eyes regularly. The amount of tear overflow varies with each individual dog and is more pronounced when they are teething. If the lower lid area or cheek are constantly wet, then wipe hourly. For dogs with less moisture from the eyes, you only need to wipe twice a day or when you spot gloop in the corner of the eye.
There are various commercial products available for wiping eyes, but previously boiled water on cotton wool is perfectly sufficient. Dampen the cotton wool with the cool water and wipe away any moisture or stickiness from the eye area. Then finish with a dry piece of cotton wool to pat the area dry.

, Many people don't do this, but it is very, very important, especially for older dogs. This will slow up tartar formation and protect your dog's dental health. Start at a young age, so the dog accepts having its teeth brushed. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and toothpaste made for dogs. It can be purchased at any pet store.


Be aware the Maltese are especially prone to the formation of plaque and then tartar formation. This irritates the gums leading to inflammation and infection. Ultimately this causes gum recession and the teeth to loosen, become infected, and fall out.
If this is your first time, rub the gums and teeth with your finger. Adding some soft dog food can make this more pleasant. Brush your dog's teeth before bed.
Alternatively speak to your vet about small-sized kibble that has a cleaning action as the dog chews. Be aware that canned food is more likely to build tartar than dry food, and speed up tartar formation.

, Maltese nails should be clipped monthly so they do not overgrow and get infected. Using a regular nail clipper, slowly begin to clip the end of your dog's nails, stopping before you reach the live center of the nail. If you are uncertain how much nail to remove, invest in a lesson from the groomer or vet tech.


The nail has a living center made up of blood vessels and nerves, called the quick. If you clip too much nail away you will cut the quick, which is painful for the dog and causes bleeding. If in doubt, err on the side of caution and remove the minimum amount possible.
The dog may be scared and will struggle. If this is the case, try feeding the dog immediately after the nail trim so that it sees its food as a reward for good behavior.
Many Maltese owners trim their dog's nails when the dog is asleep. However, you need to be very careful or it could really startle the dog awake.

, This can be done professionally, but can also be done at home. Go into the outer ears with a Q-tip, but do not stick it into the inner ear. Just use it to clean the visible part of the ear. If there is wax of any sort, be sure to clean it out.


Never put water into the dog's ears, as this softens the skin and makes it more likely to become infected. Instead, use an ear cleaner sold for the purpose. These are designed to dissolve wax and also for an excess to evaporate away, so the ear canal is not left over wet.

, The Maltese has a small stomach, so choose a premium food that is high quality. Take your vet's recommendation and also look for a food that has a named meat listed as the main ingredient.

, Feed him a high quality dog food and treats recommended by your vet. Always have fresh water and dry kibble available for your Maltese (unless the animal is an adult and is overweight). Maltese puppies can suffer from hypoglycemia, which can be life threatening, if food is not readily available.

, It may be that you are giving the dog too much food at meal time or that you are giving too many treats. Consult with your vet if your Maltese is putting on too much weight.He or she may have a suggestions for helping the dog lose weight.

, A Maltese, like all dogs, needs to be well socialized in order to become a well-rounded dog. While it is important to bond with your pup, its also important that the dog is open to meeting new people and animals. Expose your puppy to a wide variety of people and animals when it is young, so that it understands that this is a normal and enjoyable part of life.Maltese dogs that are not socialized can become either fearful or aggressive toward strangers.

, Although Maltese are good apartment dwellers and don't require a great deal of exercise, it is important for the dog's brain, socialization, sensory system, and enjoyment to get out. Even a fifteen to twenty minute walk can be a nice break for you and your dog.Maltese are adaptable when it comes to exercise. They enjoy walks but are also happy to burn energy in a restricted space, by playing games of fetch. Teach your Maltese not to jump off your bed or couch, though, as this can cause injury. The breed is vulnerable to knee injuries (luxating patellas).
Be aware that a bored Maltese may turn to barking to amuse itself.

, The Maltese is an intelligent dog and loves to be stimulated mentally. Like all dogs, your Maltese needs to be trained to sit, stay, and come when called, in addition to being potty trained. Use positive reinforcement when training, as opposed to punishment when the dog does something wrong. These dogs respond much better to treats and love as incentive to do the right thing.


Don't be fooled by their small size, they love the mental challenge of training. Indeed, some Maltese excel at agility training, albeit on a small scale, so don't write this off as an activity for your dog.

, Maltese dogs are beautiful animals that deserve to be treated with love and care. Snuggle with your pup often and show it that you care for it.

, Your veterinarian will be able to advise you as to which diseases are prevalent in the area, and which it is necessary to vaccinate against. Some states also require all pets to be vaccinated against rabies, in which case you must comply.


Take your veterinarian's advice on preventative healthcare such as heartworm, and regular worming treatments and use them regularly., If your dog is a pet and not intended for breeding, then speak to your vet about desexing. This helps reduce antisocial behaviors, such as territory marking in the male. It also reduces the risk of certain diseases in the female, such as mammary cancer (if done before the second season) and pyometra (womb infection).

, This is a permanent way of identifying the dog as yours. Should it escape or be stolen, the ID chip allows you to prove ownership, and will help someone who finds your dog locate you (vets can read the chip and find you through the registry).

Groom your dog regularly.,
Maintain your dog’s nails, teeth, and ears.,
Keep up with flea and tick care.",How to Care for an Irish Setter3," Irish Setters have beautiful coats that need regular maintenance. Brush your dog’s fur at least two to three times a week in order to prevent matting, and give it a bath monthly.Start at your dog’s head and work your way down its body. Be careful around sensitive areas, like its belly.
Use a finer comb if you come across tangles or mats. Comb them out thoroughly, but give your dog breaks as needed. Give it a treat or some play time if it gets overwhelmed or uncomfortable.
Consulting a professional groomer or trimming your dog’s fur regularly is optional, and will help keep it looking its best.

, Irish Setters’ nails grow fast, so trimming them regularly using clippers or a grinder will help prevent overgrowth and breaking.Brush your dog’s teeth three times a week, using gauze wrapped around your finger and either toothpaste for dogs or just water. Check its ears weekly for wax and debris buildup, and clean them out using a cotton ball or gauze wrapped around your finger.Choose times when your dog is calm and relaxed to brush teeth and trim nails. Try to develop a routine so it gets used to hygiene care.
Don’t use regular toothpaste when brushing your dog’s teeth, and don’t use water to clean its ears. Never place anything (e.g. a cotton swab) in your dog’s ear canal.

, Flea and tick prevention is particularly important for Irish Setters due to their coats. Check your dog’s skin and coat for ticks, fleas, and other pests after each walk. Be especially thorough if you live in a wooded area.Ask your vet to recommend or prescribe a flea and tick preventative. Use this and other pet medications as directed by your vet.

Provide food and fresh water.,
Give your dog lots of exercise.,
Keep your dog indoors.,
Groom your dog regularly.",How to Care for an Affenpinscher2," Start by selecting the right food. Affenpinscher dogs are known for having dental problems later in life, so select a small, dry kibble. Look for a product with fresh ingredients and few preservatives, and choose a blend suitable for small dogs. Follow any packaging instructions, as well as any instructions from your vet.Select a dish for food and one for water. Stainless steel is best.
Place your dog’s food and water dishes in a regular location in your home. You may want to place them on a mat.
Measure your dog’s food. The exact measurements will vary based on the type of food, your dog’s exact weight, your dog’s age, and the recommendations of your vet. In general, an Affenpinscher will consumer 1.5 cups of dry food once per day.
Feed your dog at the same time each morning. Affenpinschers thrive on routine. Feeding your dog at the same time each day help establish a daily rhythm.

, Affenpinschers are an enthusiastic, high-energy breed. As such, they need to be walked every day. Plan on taking your Affenpinscher on a good long walk daily. Additionally, you can let them run and play indoors or in your yard.Include a long, daily walk in your routine. Walking for 30 minutes to 1 hour is great exercise for your Affenpinscher.
Try playing fetch or tug of war.
Because of their small size, Affenpinschers are well-suited for apartment living, although their frequent barking may disturb your neighbors.

, Small toy breeds, such as Affenpinschers, cannot survive outdoors. Affenpinschers can be left outside for several hours in warm weather, but during the winter, they can only venture outdoors for short periods. You may consider dressing your Affenpinscher in dog clothing during the winter months.If you absolutely must keep your Affenpinscher outdoors in the cold, be sure to provide a well-insulated and heated doghouse.
Some Affenpinschers like to sleep with a hot water bottle to stay warm.

, Affenpinschers have a rough coat that needs regular attention. You should comb your dog’s fur 2-3 times a week at home. You should also bathe your Affenpinscher and trim their fur approximately every 3 months.Using a wide-toothed comb, comb your Affenpinscher’s fur roughly every other day. Work out any tangles.
Every 3 months or so, give your Affenpinscher a bath using dog shampoo.
After the bath, use a sharp pair of scissors to trim away any fur that falls into your dog’s eyes.
You may consider bringing your Affenpinscher to a professional dog groomer.

Be careful around small children.,
Be wary around rodent pets.,
Don’t worry about other dogs.",How to Care for an Affenpinscher3," Despite being generally social, Affenpinschers tend to feel threatened around toddlers and small children. Affenpinschers do well around older kids, but consider passing on this breed if you have little ones at home.If you have children over to your house, encourage them to give the dog space.
Always watch for signs of distress in your dog, such as growling or showing teeth.
Allow your Affenpinscher to approach people (children or adults) in their own time.

, Affenpinschers were originally bred to keep rat problems at bay. As such, these dogs are genetically built to kill rodents. If you have hamsters, bunnies, or other rodent pets at home, an Affenpinscher may not be the best choice for you.If you have rodent pets, keep them up high or in a room that your Affenpinscher does not have access to.

, Affenpinschers tend to get along great with other dogs. If you have other dogs at home, adding an Affenpinscher should be no problem. They tend to find their place within a pack and they make great additions to a dog-loving household.Be sure to provide individual bowls for food and water for each dog.
Provide a separate sleeping space (such as a dog bed) for each dog.
Give the dogs plenty of space to get to know each other, as well as retreat from one another.

Feed based on age.,
Refrain from overfeeding your Samoyed.,
Provide ample exercise for your Samoyed.,
Keep your Samoyed safe while outside.",How to Care for a Samoyed2," Depending on whether your Samoyed is a puppy or an adult, he will need to eat varying amounts several times each day. Samoyed puppies aged 2-3 months generally need to eat about one-half cup of kibble mixed with water three times a day.
Young Samoyeds are not great eaters and often have to be enticed to eat with meat juices or bacon grease added to their food.Once they reach 3 months, they typically eat dry kibble only twice each day.
Adult Samoyeds, older than 1 year, are best fed twice a day. Typical adult Samoyeds usually eat between 2 and 3 cups of premium dog food each day., Your Samoyed will live a longer and happier life if he maintains a healthy weight. If you notice your dog is putting on weight, decrease the amount you’re feeding him and take him on extra walks.


If you do give your Samoyed table scraps, only give chicken or beef that has been removed from the bone., This breed has a lot of energy and can become destructive if they are bored.To counter this, your Samoyed needs daily exercise, like long walks or active yard play.They are also happy to accompany you on hikes or bike rides., This breed has strong herding instincts, from their past experience herding reindeer, so they must be in a securely fenced yard if not leashed.Your fence should be strong and at least 4 feet high, since Samoyeds can jump over fences.
Never chain your Samoyed in your yard. They can become tangled in the chain and choke to death."
"
Make sure your Samoyed will be around people a lot.,
Train your Samoyed at a young age.,
Assert your role as the pack leader.",How to Care for a Samoyed3," This breed is extremely social and friendly. Conversely, they can become miserable and destructive when confined alone to a backyard. Thus, it is important to give your Samoyed lots of attention.Samoyeds love to be around children and are excellent companion dogs.
If possible, install a dog door so that your Samoyed can go out when necessary but enter to share in family activities., As the dog gets older, it can become more stubborn. By establishing house rules while your Samoyed is young and letting him know you are in charge, you will be able to have a smooth relationship. If you don’t want your Samoyed on the bed as an adult, for example, do not allow it as a puppy.
A socialization class for your Samoyed puppy and you can teach you how to relate to each other and have an effective working relationship. You will learn to be a fair and consistent owner and will learn effective voice commands.
Your breeder or veterinarian can recommend a class, or you can look online at Websites such as that for the National Association of Dog Obedience Instructors., Since Samoyeds are pack-oriented, they will look for a leader or assume that role themselves. To establish your authority, do simple things, like be sure to go through a door first when accompanied by your puppy.Or, teach your dog to wait for your signal before he starts to eat.Another way to assert your role as the “alpha” dog is to make your Samoyed move out of your way when he is lying on the floor, rather than you walk around him.
Additionally, you can reinforce your role as the leader by not sharing your bed with your Samoyed.

Avoid medicines containing sulfa.,
Look for hip dysplasia.,
Check your Samoyed’s eyes for signs of cataracts or glaucoma.,
Learn the signs of diabetes in Samoyeds.,
Visit your veterinarian regularly.",How to Care for a Samoyed4," Many Samoyeds have adverse reactions to medicines with sulfa. Mark your dog’s medical records with a note to avoid any drugs that contain sulfa or sulfonamides to avoid potential problems., This condition is characterized by an improper fit between the ball and socket in the hip joint, and this is one of the more common health conditions for Samoyeds. Symptoms include stiffness, lameness, or hearing a clicking sound when your Samoyed walks. If you suspect this is an issue, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian for a full examination., These two eye conditions commonly plague Samoyeds, and you can look for symptoms that will necessitate a trip to the vet. Your dog’s pupils may change color from black to blue or white, and his vision will be impaired if he has cataracts. Signs of glaucoma are not as readily seen by casual observers, but sometimes the eyes will appear red if glaucoma is present., Like in humans, diabetes mellitus in Samoyeds is characterized by an inability to regulate blood sugar levels. If your dog is suffering from this condition, he may have symptoms like excessive thirst and urination and weight loss. Check with your vet if you notice these signs., Depending on your Samoyed’s age, you will need to receive medical attention every few weeks or every year.


Puppies need a lot of shots, so they will need to see the vet every 3 or 4 weeks until about 16 weeks old.
Spaying or neutering typically occur at around 6 months, so a vet visit will be necessary then.
Older dogs, aged 1 and older, typically only need yearly checkups."

Keep your senior dog visually separate from your new dog.,
Introduce your senior dog to the new dog via scent.,
Give the new dog time to explore.,
Comfort your old dog.,
Find a place for the face-to-face introduction.,
Introduce them.,
Maintain good relations.",How to Introduce a New Dog to Your Senior Dog1," Place their cages at opposite ends of the house and keep them entirely separate for the first few days. During this period, you should take measures to make sure your senior dog does not see the new dog. For example, you should not let them both out of the house at the same time and should keep them in different parts of the house., Place one of the new dog’s toys in the senior dog’s cage. Your senior dog will smell the scent of the new dog and gradually get used to it. At the same time, place one of your senior dog’s toys in your new dog’s cage. Your new dog will gradually get used to the idea of another dog in the house. Dogs get to know one another via scent, so this form of introduction avoids the possibility of posing or even fighting, which could happen if you make the introduction too early., Keeping the old dog in their cage, allow the new dog to explore and smell the rest of the house, except for the area where you have your old dog. This will allow the new dog to smell the old dog a bit more while becoming accustomed to the layout of your house. Then, switch roles. Lock the new dog up, and give your old dog time to explore and smell the scents left by the new dog.

, Your old dog may be sad that you have left a new dog into the house so you will want to comfort them. Make them feel they are safe and at home by cuddling up with them on the couch or playing a favorite game.Practice patience with your old dog. Your old dog may start walking slowly or taking more time with things, so you should just be patient with them.Spend quality time with your old dog. Your old dog may not like to exercise as much, but you should still find a way of giving them quality time. This is especially the case if you are introducing a new dog into the house., After allowing your senior dog to meet your new dog via smell, you can introduce them in a neutral territory that is away from the house and other dogs. You might take them to a sports field or other natural setting that neither dog identifies as their territory., Let your senior dog smell your new dog and vice versa. Give them some time to smell one another, greet, and even play. Hopefully, they will already be used to their respective scents and will be more amenable to friendship.If your senior dog is friendly with your new dog or vice versa, you should reward them with a clicker and then a dog treat.If they start baring teeth or showing other signs of aggression, you should pull them apart and get them doing something else. You can try introducing them again later or in a different environment., After the introduction, you can let your new dog see and interact with your senior dog in the house. However, you need to continue supervising their interactions and make sure they both get adequate alone time. You can use a clicker and associated positive rewards, such as attention or a treat, to reward good behavior between your new dog and your senior dog.

"
"
Supervise social time.,
Schedule quiet time.,
Give your older dog an escape route.,
Train your older dog with a clicker.",How to Introduce a New Dog to Your Senior Dog2," You need to actually supervise all of the interactions between the new dog and the senior dog. Structure the time they spend in the same space and keep a watchful eye on their interactions.


If the senior dog growls at the new dog, you should not intervene. Growling is an important form of communication in the dog world, so your senior dog is simply teaching the new dog a valuable lesson.
If you hear loud yelps from the new dog or they start to fight, you may need to intervene, separate the dogs, and keep them apart for a few hours., Every day, you should schedule quiet time for both your senior dog and your new dog. Give them a toy to play with in their area of the house, in the backyard, cage or wherever they can spend time alone. Social time can be exhausting, especially for your senior dog., Make sure you allow a way for your senior dog to get out of the space where they are interacting with the new dog. They may get exhausted and need to leave the room or retreat to their cage.Avoid locking doors when they are playing together in the same room.
Leave your older dog’s cage open with a toy inside.
If the puppy follows the older dog when they retreat, you can stop them and put them in another room.

, Use a clicker, which is a noise making toy, to train your dogs. When either dog acts appropriately, use the clicker to signal appreciation for the good behavior. For example, if your older dog interacts well with the new dog and abstains from growling, you can use the clicker and then give attention or a treat as a reward.


If your new dog is a puppy and acts appropriately or abstains from jumping on your senior dog’s head while they are napping, you can use the clicker and then a treat to reward them.
You can buy clickers at your local pet store.

"
"
Watch for aggressive body language.,
Look for signs of exhaustion.,
Listen for yelping and squealing.,
Take note of growls.",How to Introduce a New Dog to Your Senior Dog3," Look for stiff legs, hair standing up or the baring of teeth. These are signs of aggression, so you should pull the dogs apart and get them doing something else for a minute. You can try introducing them again later.Use their leashes to pull them apart.
Make sure you have two people on hand for the introductions. You will need one person to handle each dog on a leash.
Use an appropriate collar on your senior dog and new dog. Depending on the type of dogs you own, you will need a different collar. Good collars include standard flat collars, back-clip harnesses, front-clip harnesses, and head halters. An appropriate collar will allow you to control and train your dog, including during difficult introductions.Try taking them for separate walks around the block. At the end of their solo walks, try introducing them again. If that doesn’t work, you can try again in a week.

, If your older dog is looking really tired all the time, consider giving them more time away from the new dog or the puppy. You can schedule more alone time for both your senior and your new dog, which will hopefully make their interactions more pleasant and enjoyable.


If your senior dog refuses to get up, they may be experiencing pain. They may also be exhausted from the interactions with the new dog. Give them more time away from the new dog and talk to your veterinarian about any concerning symptoms.
Give your senior dog some alone time with you on the couch. This will be comforting for them and help them adjust to a new dog in the house.

, If your puppy starts yelping or squealing, it means they want the interaction to stop. If this happens and your senior dog does not stop being aggressive, you should separate them. If you do not separate them, it is possible that your older dog will hurt the puppy., Puppies take a while to learn the nuances of dog communication. As such, they will often miss the subtle signals and body language that your senior dog uses to communicate. If this happens, your senior dog may have to resort to a growl to get their message across to your puppy. If this happens, take note of it but do not intervene. In time, your puppy will start picking up more dog language and be better able to listen to your senior dog.

Help prevent GDV.,
Get yearly check-ups and vaccinations.",How to Care for a Saint Bernard," Saint Bernards are intelligent and eager to please, but they can also be stubborn and immature. Their massive size means that bad behaviors like jumping on people can have serious consequences, so it’s important to start training while your Saint is a manageably sized and pliable puppy.You should also start socializing at a very young age. Take your new pup to the dog park and introduce it to all your friends and family in order to make them easygoing and friendly.;
, It may seem that a harsh tone of voice or swat on the nose when reprimanding your Saint Bernard is no big deal, but think again! While it will probably get your dog to stop whatever behavior they’re doing, it won’t get them to understand that you’re objecting to a particular behavior. Instead, your dog will react fearfully to your agitation and not link the reprimand to a problematic behavior.


Keeping your voice calm and measured will help you communicate clearly with your Saint Bernard, rather than confusing and frightening it with your fluctuating verbal cues.
Just because you keep a level head and avoid punishing your dog, doesn’t mean that you should be a pushover. Your Saint wants to obey you, but you have to show that you’re the leader of the pack. Stand erect with your shoulders back and speak in a firm voice in order to establish your status., Telling your dog “no” when it does something bad rarely works as a training strategy because you're only discouraging bad behaviors rather than encouraging positive ones. Instead of reproaching your dog when it does something wrong, reward it with a treat and verbal praise whenever it does the right thing. Just make sure you deliver your praise and treat within a few seconds so that your dog can link the reward with the behavior you’re encouraging.When your Saint does something naughty, think about your response as a correction and not as a punitive measure. A quick collar shake and calm “no” should stop the behavior in its tracks without spooking your dog and disrupting the trust developing between you.Consider registering for obedience classes if you feel overwhelmed at the prospect of training your Saint Bernard. You won’t walk away with a K-9 unit pro or a circus dog, but you should notice a pronounced improvement in your dog’s behavior after a six- to eight-week course.

, Saint Bernards are highly intelligent and powerful animals, and they enjoy performing activities that allow them to utilize these innate skills and assets. It’s also a good way for both you and your Saint to stay active and socialize with other Saint Bernard dogs and their owners.If you’re unfamiliar with these activities, you can get involved in them through a local club, such as the Saint Bernard Club of America, the American Kennel Club, or a training school.

, Saint Bernards aren’t extremely playful or energetic, so it’s important to get these lovably lazy monsters moving. Take a couple of brief, moderately paced strolls—about twenty minutes per walk should be sufficient—as well as some shorter runs to get its heart rate up.Unlike other large breeds, Saint Bernards don’t require lots of outdoor space in which to run around and play. They’ll enjoy a stroll and a sniff around, but they’re more likely to use your backyard real estate for a nap in the sun than a jog round the perimeter.Saint Bernards are prone to heatstroke and exhaustion, so make sure you don’t overexert them. If you’re wanting a running buddy to train for your next 5k, you should look to another breed., Saint Bernards may look tough and self-sufficient, but they’re actually big babies when it comes to spending time alone. They thrive on sustained and continuous interaction, preferring to be indoors as a member of the family rather than lone wolfing it outside. If you leave them alone for too long, they’re likely to fret and act out with negative, nervous behaviors, so you should consider another breed if you’re a workaholic who is rarely at home.When you absolutely must leave your dog alone, supply it with plenty of rubber chew toys. Otherwise, they’ll improvise and find something like a sock, shoe, or couch cushion to distract themselves., Though it can be a bit pricey, try to fit a premium brand of dog food into your budget, as it will help your dog lead a longer, healthier life. Ask your vet for specific recommendations, but, as a general rule, refer to the first five ingredients on the nutrition label as the most important indicators of a food's quality. You'll want to pick a kibble that contains meat as the first ingredient and preferably two meat proteins in the five initial ingredients.You can mix some wet food into your dog’s kibble if they like it, but don’t rely on this moist variety too much. Compared to dry food, it contains little nutrition, especially when you consider its relatively high price.

, Many people assume that, due to their massive size and weight, Saint Bernards must consume huge quantities of food. In fact, due to their low-key temperaments and activity levels, they require less food per pound than most smaller dogs.You should take your dog’s precise weight and measurements when planning portions, but, as a general guideline, you should plan to feed your Saint Bernard between four and eight cups of kibble a day.When your Saint Bernard is still a puppy (up to 18 months), you should feed it three times a day, but in adulthood you can cut down to two meals a day.
Always let your Saint Bernard rest after eating, ideally for several hours. Exercise on a full stomach may increase the risk of bloat (GDV), a potentially lethal condition.

, Saint Bernards have very thick coats which grow rapidly, so you’ll need to dedicate at least ten to fifteen minutes every day to brushing your dog’s coat. Slacking on this daily ritual will lead to matting and poor hygiene, and you risk letting problems such as ticks and skin irritation go undetected.Even if you groom your Saint religiously, be prepared for a significant amount of shedding. If you’re a stickler for domestic cleanliness and order, a Saint is probably not the best breed for you, as they’re naturally seasonal shedders that can slough whole bags of fur in a single day.
There are short-haired Saints as well as the more famous long-haired ones, but even the short-haired Saints will shed and require regular grooming., Even with regular brushing, your Saint’s dense coat will gather dirt and debris over time. So, while you don’t need to bathe your dog every day, you should make sure to do so every month or so. Use a safe dog-specific shampoo and conditioner, and make sure to clean inside your dog’s ears with a mild ear cleaning solution and cotton balls.Be sure to rinse and dry your Saint thoroughly after your bath, as leaving any shampoo or damp spots can cause matting and irritation on the skin. You can towel dry as well as use a blow dryer.

, The mouths of Saint Bernards are designed in such a way that they produce significant and continuous amounts of drool. Consider this an unavoidable aspect of this breed, so don’t adopt or purchase a Saint if you’re fastidious about your walls, floors, and furniture.


There have been some recent developments in canine plastic surgery which make it possible to surgically reduce your dog’s salivation, but you probably shouldn’t consider this to be viable option for this innate slobberer., Due to their relatively low activity levels and placid demeanors, Saint Bernards can be particularly susceptible to weight gain. Excessive weight can lead to joint problems and cardiovascular conditions, so make sure you avoid these health issues by monitoring your dog’s weight. Ask your vet for specific guidelines which take your dog’s size into consideration, but, as a general rule of thumb, your Saint should weight no more than 200 pounds.Most dogs can be assessed visually by checking for a waistline and slightly visible ribs, but a Saint Bernard's heavy coat can make this difficult. Rely instead on your scale and the vet’s evaluation.
Even if you’re feeding your Saint the appropriate portions, your dog can put on weight if you give it too many treats. Remember that treats can be quite calorific, especially when they add up., Saint Bernards are susceptible to some painful joint and bone conditions, as well as eye conditions with potentially serious consequences. They have the highest incidence rate of hip dysplasia of all breeds, as well as bone growth conditions such as osteochondritis and abnormal calcification. You can check for signs of these painful conditions by monitoring your dog’s gait. If you suspect any pain, go to the vet immediately and have them perform diagnostic radiographs.Entropion and ectropion—a condition where the dog’s eyelids roll inward or outward—are the most common eye problems for Saint Bernards. It’s a treatable condition, but make sure to nip it in the bud as, left untreated, it can cause eventual blindness., ""Gastric Dilation and Volvulus,"" informally called bloat, is a major health concern for this breed. When the Saint Bernard's stomach becomes overfull, it can twist, blocking the throat and blood supply. Learn how to reduce this risk:Don't let your dog eat or drink large amounts in one sitting. Divide its daily food into two or or three meals.
Never add water to dry food.
Avoid foods that list fat or oil as one of the first four ingredients.
Place the food bowl directly on the floor, not raised above ground level.
If your dog eats quickly, force it to slow down with a specially designed bowl or by placing a large rock in the center of the food.
Avoid exercising the dog for several hours after eating.
Watch for a bloated stomach and other symptoms of GDV. If they occur, bring the dog to emergency vet care. GDV can be fatal, so do not delay.

, The average lifespan of a Saint Bernard lifespan is relatively short—usually between 8 and 10 years—so you should be proactive about its health to maximize your time together.Schedule regular appointments with your local vet even if you don’t notice any worrying symptoms, as you can run routine blood screens, check your dog’s weight, and ask about your dietary and exercise regime.


Hip dysplasia treatments can be pricey, particularly if you opt for a surgical resolution, so you might want to consider purchasing health insurance for your Saint.Ask your vet if they have any recommendations for insurance and explore your options online.

Make sure your dog gets lots of interaction.,
Play with your dog.,
Stimulate your dog's mind.",How to Keep an Older Dog Mentally Active1," Dogs that are left alone all the time will not be able to stay mentally healthy. A dog that does not have a lot of social interaction can lose its mental acuity because it doesn't exercise its brain. Dogs are meant to have social interaction, as they are pack animals, and they need it to avoid becoming sad, lonely, and destructive.Interaction can come in a lot of forms. It could mean taking your dog for a walk, playing catch, or simply giving it love and attention.
The interaction doesn't have to always come from you. If you know you are going to be gone all day, for example, you can take your dog to a doggy daycare. This will give your dog lots of interaction.
Some dogs benefit from living in a household with multiple dogs. Having more than one dog at home can give your dog lots of positive interaction while you are away.;
, There are a wide variety of games that you can play with your dog that will stimulate its brain. Even common games, such as tug-o-war or catch, can give it a lot of stimulation and keep it mentally active. Other games you can play include:Work on advanced training, such as teaching your dog to play dead.
Hide your dog's favorite toy and have it find it.
Train your dog to identify its toys by name and to get specific toys when you ask for them by name.

, Toys, such as puzzles, can stimulate your dog while you are away or unable to directly play with the dog. These puzzles use treats or regular dog food as motivation for the dog to complete the challenge.Buy a food puzzle that requires your dog to complete tasks in order to get food. There are a wide variety of these puzzles sold at pet stores or online. The added benefit of these puzzles is that they can be used to slow down your dog's eating.
In order to keep your dog's mind stimulated, switch out your dog's toys and puzzles on a regular basis. New toys mean new stimulation and fun.

Take your dog somewhere new.,
Let your dog meet other dogs.,
Teach your dog to do tricks.",How to Keep an Older Dog Mentally Active2," If your dog likes to be outside, you should take your older dog to explore a new place. New sights and smells can be invigorating to a dog that only gets to go to the same places all of the time.Taking your dog to a new place doesn't mean that you need to go a long distance. For example, if you normally walk your dog on the same route every day, try switching up that route. New sights and smells in the neighborhood can be just as exciting as the sights and smells a long distance from home.

, If your dog generally gets along with other dogs, it can be very exciting and fun for it to meet a new dog. This can be stimulating and positive for an older dog.The easiest way for your dog to meet other dogs is at a dog park. While you won't be able to easily control what dogs your dog interacts with, your dog will likely get to meet a lot of other dogs.
You can also make a date to meet up with a friend who has a dog. Perhaps you have a friend that has a young dog that needs to be socialized with other dogs. Let your older dog have a fun experience while also helping out a friend with their dog.

, If you are looking for new ways to stimulate your dog, then you should consider teaching it something new. With rewards-based training you can get your dog to do a wide variety of tricks.


Some tricks you might like your dog to do include playing dead, spinning in a circle, or giving you a high five.
Teaching your dog to do tricks will take time and concentration from both you and your dog. The key is repetition and positive reinforcement.

Lethargy or lack of energy.
Lack of interest in playing
Loss of appetite






Unsocial behavior

You can also give the dog kibble in a kong-type dog toy or food puzzle. The dog may enjoy trying to get the food out of the toy.
While a few extra treats here and there may not be detrimental to your dog, you should avoid giving the dog too many treats during this period. They may learn that they will be rewarded for whining, and they may not eat their normal food., Older dogs may not be extremely active to begin with, but they may become more lethargic after the loss of their owner. Such inactivity can lead to further health problems. If the dog is able, take them on a walk at least once or twice a day. Depending on the age and health of the dog, these may be short walks., If the dog continues to mourn for several weeks or if the dog is not eating, you should visit the vet to make sure that the dog is still in good health.

Maintain a routine.,
Take care of your own grief.,
Reinforce positive behavior.,
Weigh the pros and cons of getting a new dog.",How to Help an Older Dog Grieve the Loss of Its Owner3," For the first few days after the owner has died, it is important to maintain the dog’s routine as much as possible. Older dogs tend not to do well with new habits, schedules, or activities, and the owner’s death may have already disrupted their life. Try to feed and walk the dog at the same times as the old owner did.If you do not know what schedule the old owner kept, you can develop a new schedule for the dog. Keep a consistent routine for the first few weeks that the dog joins you. The dog may also prompt you when they expect to be fed or taken outside.
If there has been upheaval in the dog’s life since the owner died (for example, if the dog has been passed around by family members or if you adopted the dog from a shelter), setting a routine will be even more important for the dog. Make sure that you stick to the schedule to help the dog ease into their new home life.

, If you knew the old owner, you may be grieving yourself. This is understandable. Do what you have to so that you can grieve in your own, personal way. This will in turn help the dog by providing a loving, happy home for them.Avoid mourning in front of the dog. Dogs are very sensitive to grief, and they may exhibit signs of mourning if they understand that you are grieving.

While you may want to give the dog a treat during these episodes, you should avoid rewarding them for this behavior. The dog may learn that they will earn treats if they whine. Instead, reward the dog when they are being good, such as when they are quietly resting.For example, you may notice that the dog is sitting outside of your bedroom door at night and whining. Instead of waking up to comfort the dog, go back to sleep. In the morning, you can pet and talk to the dog. If they are well-behaved, give them a treat with their breakfast.
Good times to treat the dog are when the dog is resting quietly, when the dog is sitting with you, or right before you leave the house.

, While a new dog companion might provide company for the dog, many older dogs do not do well with a new younger dog in the house. While some older dogs may enjoy having a puppy around, others may snap at the younger dog or bully them. Consider carefully whether a new dog is appropriate for the older dog.If a friend or family member has a puppy, ask if they can be introduced to your older dog. This will show you how well the dog deals with energetic puppies. If the older dog plays, cuddles, or gets along with the puppy, you might consider getting a younger dog.
Another option is to adopt an older or senior dog. Try to find one with a similar temperament. See if the dogs can meet first before you adopt to see if they are friendly with one another."

That said, there is no gold standard for measuring pain in animals and your assessment will be largely subjective.Talk to your veterinarian about your observations and reflections on your senior dog’s pain and see if they have any suggestions for treatment or other options.


You might also consider using a scale to determine your senior dog’s quality of life, including in relation to pain, happiness, mobility, and other factors.

, This scale helps you determine your senior dog’s quality of life during emotionally difficult times. It was developed by Dr. Alice Villalobos and gives an objective measure of quality of life by measuring levels of hurt, hunger, hydration, hygiene, happiness, mobility, and more good days than bad. It is best to complete the scale three days in a row in order to ensure you are getting an accurate reading and to consult with your veterinarian about the possible implications of the scale results., To assess hurt or pain, consider the extent to which your senior dog’s pain is being successfully managed. If your senior dog is having difficulty breathing or expressing other signs of pain, take notes of these symptoms. Considering the level of pain or hurt your senior dog is experiencing, score the success of their pain management on a range from 1-10 where higher numbers indicate more success in managing their pain.For example, a score of 1 would indicate severe pain and 10 would indicate very successful pain management.

Dogs are social animals so you should make sure you give them the opportunity to be close to the family. If you have tried to lift your senior dog’s spirits in various ways but they still look rather glum or unhappy, you should take note of this sign of a diminishing quality of life. Give a score between 1 and 10 to indicate the level of happiness that your senior dog currently experiences, with a higher score indicating greater happiness., Observe your senior dog’s movement around the house and the backyard. If they have trouble moving around the house, you may want to install aids such as dog stairs to help them get up onto beds or couches.

Assign a score between 1 and 10 to indicate your senior dog’s mobility level, with a higher score indicating greater freedom of movement.Take notes on your senior dog’s mobility. If there are particularly difficult situations such as getting into the car or onto the couch, you might be able to use an aid to solve the problem. However, if your senior dog is simply unable to move or rarely moves, it is a sign of a diminishing quality of life.

, Reflecting on the last week or month, consider whether your senior dog has had more good days than bad days. A bad day might be a day where your senior dog looks depressed, experiences a lot of pain, or has ongoing health issues. A good day might be a day when they look more like their usual self and show signs of playfulness or affection with other family members. If there are far more bad than good days, it is a sign of a diminishing quality of life. You should assign a score of between 1 and 10, with higher scores indicating a better proportion of good to bad days.You could take journal notes on good versus bad days every day for a couple weeks. Then, add up the total number for both good and bad days and compare them in order to make an accurate score.

, The total score should be the sum of the individual totals (i.e., 1-10 scores) for hurt (i.e., pain), hunger, hydration, hygiene, happiness, mobility, and more good days than bad. If your total score is above 35, your senior dog still has a good quality of life. If they scored less than 35 points, you should talk to your veterinarian about your senior dog’s diminishing quality of life and possible medical options, including euthanasia., Put yourself in your senior dog’s paws.

If you think your senior dog is ready to move on to a better place, talk to your veterinarian about euthanasia.
If you think your senior dog is ready to go, you could tell your veterinarian: ""Imagining myself as Sam (insert your dog's name), I can't believe I would want to keep on living with all of the daily pain, not being able to eat, drink water, or play with friends and family anymore. I think it is time to move on.""

In turn, the older dog may be aggressive toward the younger dog to try to maintain its dominant position.Aggression can also occur between older and younger dogs because the older dog is no longer clearly communicating with the younger dog, possibly because it's physical unable to do so. Without proper social signals, aggression could occur between the dogs., Older dogs that have lost their vision and/or hearing receive less sensory input from their environment, meaning they’re less aware of what’s going on around them. For example, if your dog can’t hear very well, it won’t know when someone is approaching it. This can startle your dog and trigger aggression.If your dog can’t see, but can still hear, it may become startled when it hears a sound but can’t tell where it’s coming from.
An older with hearing and vision loss can become even more startled, leading to aggression.

, Pain can cause an older dog to become aggressive, due to irritability from the pain.Dental disease can be very painful and is a common underlying health problem related to aggression in older dogs.If your dog will allow you, look in its mouth for signs of dental disease:Bad breath
Gingivitis (red, irritated gums)
Bleeding from the mouth
Loose or missing teeth
Plaque buildup on the teeth

, As dogs get older, their joints can become stiff and painful, making movement difficult. If your dog can’t move away from a situation it finds threatening or annoying, it may respond by becoming aggressive.Take notice if your dog has trouble standing up after lying down, or can’t move up and down the stairs like it used to.
In addition to making movement difficult, arthritis can be very painful. If your dog has painful arthritis, it may display aggression to avoid being touched., It can be hard to see your older dog become aggressive. Before the aggression can be treated, though, its cause needs to be identified.Your vet will examine your dog, get a history from you, and perform diagnostic tests to determine what’s causing the aggression.

, Because aggression in older dogs can have many different causes, your vet will need detailed information about your dog’s aggressive behavior. During the appointment with your vet, include the following information about the aggression:


When the aggression started
What the aggression looks like (snarling, growling, baring teeth, nipping)
When the aggression occurs (meeting new people, interacting with other dogs, when you try to touch your dog)
Any aggression problems when your dog was younger, and if those problems were treated

, Your vet will do a physical exam of your dog, looking for any physical problems that could be causing your dog’s aggression. For example, your vet will look in your dog’s mouth for signs of painful dental disease and check your dog’s joints for arthritis.


Your vet will also perform a neurologic exam to determine if your dog has a neurologic disease, such as dementia, that could be causing the aggression.Your vet may also conduct tests to assess vision and/or hearing loss in your dog.
If your dog is in a lot of pain, your vet may want to briefly sedate your dog so they can examine your dog’s mouth and joints more safely.

, Based on the physical exam findings and the information you provided, your vet may want to perform additional diagnostic tests. If your dog’s joints seemed stiff, your vet may recommend x-rays to take a closer look at the joints.


If your dog’s mouth looked unhealthy, dental x-rays would help your vet determine the extent of dental disease.
Blood work may also help your vet determine if an underlying health problem is causing the aggression.

, If a medical problem is not causing your older dog’s aggression, then a behavioral issue could be the cause. Your vet may refer you to a qualified animal behavior expert who can conduct a more detailed behavioral assessment of your dog.Animal behavior experts have various qualifications, including Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist and board certification in veterinary behavior.Use the website http://iaabc.org/consultants to find a qualified animal behaviorist in your area.

Avoid startling your dog.,
Maintain your dog’s routine.,
Discuss using a head halter with a behavioral expert.",How to Handle Irritability in Older Dogs3," One thing that might cause irritability and aggression in your aging dog is being startled. When dogs age, their senses weaken. They can’t see, hear, or smell as well as they used to. This can cause them to get scared or startled easier than they used to.You may try always approaching your dog from the front instead of behind. This helps them see your before you touch them.
Try speaking and stopping right in front of them before touching them if that causes them to be irritable.

, Senior dogs get set in their ways and react negatively to stress. To help reduce your dog’s stress and irritability, try to keep their routine as close to normal as possible. Try to do things around the same time each day, and don’t try too many new things with your senior dog.For example, keep feeding times and walks as consistent as possible. Each day should be around the same as before.
Try not to take your dog to unfamiliar places because it could upset them or confuse them.

, If your older dog’s irritability leads to aggressive behavior, such as snapping or biting at others, consult a behavioral expert on the proper use of a head halter. Head halters and leashes can help you maintain some control over your dog and let them stay with you. Note that this will not prevent the dog from biting, but it can give you more control over the dog's actions.Never leave a dog wearing a head halter alone. This can be dangerous for your dog.

Try snug fitting clothes.,
Play with your dog.,
Consider medications if nothing else works.",How to Handle New Noise Phobias in Older Dogs2," Snug clothing can wrap around your dog to help reduce their anxiety. Wrapping your dog is believed to help reduce anxiety much like swaddling babies. Many products are available that are marketed as anti-anxiety and stress-relieving calming coats for dogs.You may want to try wrapping your dog firmly, but gently in a blanket to help them feel safe and reduce their anxiety. You want to wrap their torso area, not their legs and head.
Many commercial garments are specifically designed to help dogs who get separation anxiety or noise anxiety during storms, but it can also work for any loud noise. You can purchase these online or in pet stores.

, You may be able to lessen your dog’s noise anxiety by playing with them or distracting them with toys. You can try to give your dog their favorite chew toy since chewing can help relieve stress in dogs.Try something that will keep your dog distracted, like a bone, tougher treat, or tough rubber toys. Many of these toys are puzzle toys may also help keep your dog distracted. You can hide treats or something else inside that they can get out.
If you can play fetch or tug of war with them to help, try that.

, There are medications that your vet can give your dog to help with their anxiety. However, medications to help your dog’s anxiety are generally a last resort. You should try everything else before consulting your veterinarian.Every dog is different, so there is no standard anxiety medication for dogs. Your vet will look at your dog’s age, their particular case of noise anxiety, and their overall health to determine if medication is a treatment for them.

Identify your dog’s exact birth date, if possible.,
Collect your pet’s medical information.,
Understand limitations to policies.,
Decide between full coverage policies or accident and injury plans.,
Request quotes.,
Identify policy limits.,
Compare the policy limits against the cost of common illnesses.,
Determine whether your veterinarian accepts the insurance.,
Read the fine print to understand what you need to do to keep the policy valid.,
Find a low deductible.,
Compare premiums.,
Understand the claim process.",How to Find Veterinary Insurance for Older Dogs," This will be one of the first questions a veterinary insurance company will ask. They will not accept an answer of ""somewhere around 8 or 9"" for example. If you don't know the exact birth date, then come up with the closest date you can.


Owners with pets that have been rescued from shelters or rescue groups may not have accurate information about their pet’s age. Using the information that you do have, you can ask your veterinarian to give their expert opinion on your dog’s age.;
, This is especially important if your pet has a pre-existing or chronic condition. Some pet insurance companies will not cover pre-existing conditions, which may limit your selection of policies. Policies may or may not cover chronic illnesses, like diabetes or allergies. Talk to your veterinarian and ask for copies of your dog’s medical records so you can send a copy to the pet insurance company.


There are some policies that do cover chronic, congenital, or hereditary conditions. The policy may or may not cover these conditions after your dog is diagnosed if they consider these to be pre-existing conditions. Be sure to check with the insurance company to make sure you know exactly what is and isn't covered., Age is going to be your primary concern when looking at policies. When you identify plans that either have no age restriction, or those that have a limit that your pet falls under, there still may be other restrictions in place. Some insurance companies will not cover certain breeds or charge higher premiums. Pre-existing conditions will also be a considerable concern.


No pet insurance company will cover a pre-existing condition. However, some may cover a percentage of treatment costs, although this is increasingly rare.The breed of your senior dog will matter as well. Mutts, or mixed breed, dogs are generally the cheapest to cover. Large breeds, like Great Danes, short nosed dogs, like a pug, and purebred dogs are more expensive to cover., Full coverage plans cover preventative care, routine care, and treatments for accidents and injuries. Accident and injury plans, as the name suggests, only cover treatment and procedure costs for accidents and injuries.These policies do not cover routine care, or costs associated with illnesses and diseases.


Pet insurance companies that only offer accident and injury plans to senior pets are more likely to not have age restrictions. However, your dog will likely be diagnosed with a chronic condition as they age and these plans will not cover those expenses., Get quotes from at least 3 different companies, and compare the benefits that each offers. Many pet insurance companies will offer quotes online, but you will receive a more individualized quote when you request it in writing. Request as many quotes as you’d like, but try to gather at least three so you can compare the policies on a wider scale.

, After a certain amount of money, the pet insurance company will not reimburse you for medical costs. This could either be a per-incident limit, or a lifetime limit. Your limits will be determined by the amount you pay each year in premiums. The higher your premium, the higher your limit will be. These may also be called maximum payouts in your quotes.


Say your policy limit is $2,000. If this is a per-incident limit, you will continue to be reimbursed for your dog’s medical expenses as long as treatment costs for each specific illness or injury do not exceed $2,000. If you have a lifetime limit, this is the maximum amount of money that the insurance company will pay out during your dog’s lifetime., Senior dogs are at higher risks for diseases and illnesses as they age. Many congenital and hereditary conditions only begin to manifest as a dog ages, and some diseases, like cancer, are much more prevalent in senior pets than young dogs. By comparing the size of your policy limit to the average costs of some common treatments, you can better assess the policy limit.


Average claims for renal failure procedures, which are related to kidney conditions, cost around $500. Cancer treatments cost upwards of $700 for treatment procedures., While many pet insurance providers do not have networks, which means you can see any veterinarian you choose, others require that veterinarians accept their policies.This may or may not apply to your case, and will depend upon the companies you are comparing.


If the policies you are comparing do have networks, speak with your veterinarian to see if they accept this insurance. If they do not, you can look for a different policy.

, For example, the insurance policy may require that your dog be seen for an annual health exam, or require that your dog is current on all vaccinations, or seen by a vet within the first 30 days that your policy is effective. If you don't fulfill what the policy requires it could render your policy invalid and benefits may not be paid.


Make sure you read and understand each part of the policy. Failure to do so may result in a lapse of coverage, or your claims being denied.

, The deductible is the amount of money you will pay out of pocket for veterinarian visits, exams and procedures. Once you reach your deductible, the pet insurance company will begin to reimburse all, or a portion, of your bill. So if you have a $500 deductible, you will pay for $500 of the veterinary bills during the year, but as soon as your bills become higher, like $1,000, the insurance company will begin to reimburse you.Lower deductibles are ideal, as long as there are comparable scopes of coverage.

, The premium is the amount that you will pay for the policy. You will pay either monthly, quarterly, or annually. Some pet insurance companies offer different premium levels that correspond to different deductibles. Generally, the higher your premium is, the lower your deductible will be.If you fail to pay your premium, your policy will expire and your coverage will lapse.

, Unlike with human insurance, where the doctor’s office bills the insurance company directly, you will pay out of pocket for any veterinarian care. After you have paid out of pocket, you will submit a claim to the pet insurance company. They will either deny your claim, or issue you a reimbursement. Depending on your policy, they may cover anywhere from 25% to 100% of the bill.Ask the pet insurance company what the average claim response time is. You don’t want to be stuck with an ongoing claim for months without receiving reimbursement. You can also search online for reviews about the company’s customer service.
Different pet insurance companies will have slightly different claims procedures, like requiring an online form or a copy of the veterinarian’s notes.

Have an ownership agreement in place.",How to Adopt a Dog As an Unmarried Couple," A dog is technically property in the eyes of the law. If you're adopting as a couple and are unmarried, you need to make sure you both are legal owners. It's a good idea for both of you to be legal owners of the dog so your rights are protected in the event of a breakup.Talk to a variety of shelters and ask about how they determine legal ownership. Legal ownership is usually established on adoption paperwork and vet bills. See if you can fill out the paperwork together so you're both the legal owners.;
, Who will take care of the dog most of the time and what is that person's lifestyle like? If one person will be the dog's primary caregiver, you want to make sure you choose a dog that matches with that person's lifestyle.Is one of you going to spend more time with the dog than the other? Maybe one of you works from home and has a flexible schedule, for example. Make sure the person who will spend more time with the dog is able to meet the dog's needs. Think about the kind of dog that person can best care for.
You should also keep in mind how this may affect emotions in the event of a breakup. Whoever is the primary caregiver may be slightly more attached to the dog, so this is something to keep in mind.

, If you both intend to share responsibility, you should make sure you pick a dog that matches your lifestyle. If you're a very physically active couple who hikes together, for example, you may do well with an energetic younger dog or puppy. However, if you and your partner stay in more, you may want a dog that's more laid back. An older dog may suit you better.


You should read up on a variety of dog breeds online, and also make sure to ask a lot of questions about adoptable dogs at a variety of shelters. This way, you can find the dog most likely to match with your lifestyle.

, If you're paying for the dog together, find a price range that works for both of you. If one person is paying more for the dog, or paying for the dog completely, think about how this will affect legal ownership and whether it will be an issue down the road.Think about how much you can reasonably put towards a dog in the coming months. Remember, there is more than just the cost of the adoption fee to consider. You also have to think about things like vet visits and supplies you will need early on.
If one person is paying more for the dog, have a talk about this. Make sure you're both okay with one person putting more money forward and, in the event of a breakup, the issue of money will not determine ownership.
Total costs do vary, especially if your dog has extra vet bills for any reason, but on average the first year cost of a dog is around $1,270., You can find animal shelters online or in your local yellow pages. Call a variety of shelters and ask about their policies on unmarried couples adopting dogs together.Most shelters will probably accommodate you, but stricter shelters may not allow unmarried couples to adopt as they may fear a breakup could affect the stability of the dog's home life.
Make sure you are both allowed to sign documents assuring you're the legal owners of the dog.

, Before leaving for the shelter, check the website or make a phone call. You want to make sure you bring any documentation required to adopt if you find a dog you like. You will probably need a picture ID, as well as things like proof of address and income.If you intend to do a dual adoption, make sure both of you bring these papers.

, No one will be better able to find a dog that meets your needs than the staff or volunteers. These people spend many hours a day caring for the dogs at the shelter, so they should have a sense of each dog's personality. Let a staff worker know the temperament you're looking for in a dog and they should be able to help find you a match. Let them know how the two of you function as a couple and what your overall lifestyle is together, as this will help the shelter find a dog that meets both your needs.You should also let them know if you're looking a particular breed or age.
If one of you will be the dog's primary caregiver, let the shelter worker know this.

, You want to make sure you pick a dog with a good temperament. Ideally, you want to be able to keep the dog long-term without problems. A friendlier dog is less likely to pose a problem.Look for dogs who are opening their mouths and squinting slightly when you walk by their cages. You should also look for dogs whose tails are wagging slowly.
Dogs who are barking loudly or growling, or who crouch when you pass by, are less likely to be friendly.
Make sure the dog is friendly towards both of you. Some dogs may take more to one person, and you want to make sure the dog you pick works for both of you as a couple.

, When you find a dog you're interested in, there may be certain requirements. You may have to, for example, spend a set amount of time interacting with the dog before you make your final decision. Make sure to follow these rules so you can smoothly complete the adoption process.Remember, such rules are in place for a reason. You want to make sure the dog you select is a good match for you, and the staff does as well. It's okay if you realize, while interacting with a dog, that you've changed your mind about it.
As both of you are adopting a dog, both of you should follow the rules closely to make sure the adoption goes through smoothly and you are both the legal owners of the dog.

, If possible, sign contracts using both your names. As an unmarried couple, you will want to make sure you are both the legal owners. You may also each have to fill out an adoption contract or application.Contracts and applications usually ask for basic information, like your name, address, and so on. Applications may ask a few questions about how you plan to care for the dog just to make sure you'll be a solid owner.

, Shelters usually have upfront adoption fees. These can vary from shelter to shelter, and some shelters may charge more for puppies than older dogs. Make sure to pay the fee before you leave to complete your adoption.Know how the fee can be paid. If the place is cash only, for example, make sure to bring cash with you.

, While no one likes to think about it, breakups do happen. It's important you have an ownership agreement in place in the event you and your partner split up.Think about whether you could share custody of the dog in a breakup. Maybe you would be comfortable trading the dog off every other week, for example.
It may also simply make sense for one person to keep the dog in the event of a breakup. If one person has more time to care for the dog, or is more financially stable, that person may have to agree to take the dog if a breakup happens.

Avoid getting frustrated with your dog.,
Stay relaxed when around your pet.,
Refrain from being overly comforting.",How to Handle New Noise Phobias in Older Dogs3," It can be frustrating when your dog barks or gets upset at new noises. However, your dog picks up on your moods, so getting upset, angry, or frustrated will just increase the anxiety in your dog.You may not understand why your dog is upset over the noises, but they look to you for comfort and reassurance. Love your older dog, and don’t scold them for their anxiety.

, Your dog feels comfort when you are around, so if there are noises that upset your older pet, don’t leave them alone. Instead, stay near them and spend time with them. You don’t have to go out of your way to comfort them. Just be close to help them feel safe.For example, if you get upset because they are upset, the dog may pick up on it. Excessively comforting them may make them feel more anxious.
Relax with your dog on the couch, play with them, or pet them gently. Let them know you are there.

, While you want to make sure you keep your dog close so they feel safe, you should just act like everything is normal. If you reassure your dog too much, you could reinforce the negative, fearful behavior. Instead, pretend they are not anxious.Avoid cooing or petting your dog while talking in soothing tones. This could reinforce negative behavior. Instead, do normal things to distract your dog, like playing a with them.

There are a number of online resources as well as books and magazines dedicated to different dog breeds to help you in your search.Match the breed to your activity level. Some dog breeds are more energetic than others. If you are a sedentary person who enjoys quiet activities, it would be ill-advised to adopt breed of dog known for its high energy, such as Boxer or a Jack Russell Terrier. Instead, look at quiet breeds like Pekingese or Shih Tzus.
Take your living area into account. Think about adopting a dog on the smaller side if you live in an apartment. Larger dogs can live in smaller areas, but special care should be taken to ensure they receive the proper amount of exercise. On the other hand, some small dogs may feel overwhelmed or in a dangerous environment at a home with acres of land.
Determine your time constraints. If you adopt a puppy, you may have to do all the training. Older dogs may already be housebroken and have some training. Additionally, some dogs simply need more stimulation throughout the day. Consider how much time you have to give to your new dog.;
, Consider whether you would like to adopt a special needs dog. Special needs dogs come in many forms, from those needing extra vet care and those who have physical disabilities to those who may have been abused and have behavioral or emotional issues.Ensure you understand the needs of the dog before you commit to adopting it. A dog that has a chronic condition may require frequent trips to the vet. Make sure you can handle that expense if that is the kind of care your special needs dog requires.
Set aside some extra time for the dog. Many dogs are nervous when they are first brought to a new home, and that can be compounded for special needs dogs. Make sure you have extra time set aside when you first adopt the dog to familiarize it with you, anyone else in your home, and the new space.
Ask the shelter or rescue, “What specifically will I need to do and to supply in order to properly care for this dog?”

, Dog breeds of all ages and training levels may be found at a shelter. Call and ask to set up a visit so that you can come by and meet the adoptable dog. Also ask them how you might be able to meet dogs in their foster program, if they have one.Consider looking at the shelter’s website before you visit. Many shelters have information regarding adoptable pets both in their shelter and in their foster home program. Read over pet profiles to get to know the dogs’ personalities as well as their individual needs.
Put your name on the shelter's call list if you are looking for a very specific type of dog, such as a rare breed. Most shelters will give you a call if a certain type of dog is brought to them.
Contact your local breed rescue. If you want to adopt a certain breed of dog or desire a purebred, look online or in the phone book for numbers to a breed rescue.

, This may include a collar and leash, food and water bowls, and appropriate food. You may also want to buy a crate or a carrier, toys, dog bed, and training treats. Here is a list of useful supplies:Food dish
Dog food
Water dish
Harness or collar
Leash
Tag
Dog bed
A crate
A travel carrier
A dog bed and/or a blanket
New toys

, You likely don’t need to set up a patient profile with a vet before you adopt your dog, but shelters often ask you to find a veterinary practice you want to use before you bring your dog home. This ensures that you are prepared from the moment you bring your dog home.Contact local vets and ask about their experience with your kind of dog. If you are adopting a certain breed, ask the vet if they are comfortable working with that breed. If you are getting a special needs pet, ask the vet if they have experience caring for your dog’s particular needs.
Ask about a wellness plan. Many vets do puppy and dog wellness plans that include a certain number of visits and services, such as vaccines and heartworm tests, a year. Ask your vet if they offer packages at a discounted rate to help keep your new dog covered.

, If your house is not already set up for your new dog, go through and make sure you remove or relocate potential hazards for your new pet. The extent of dog-proofing will depend largely on the size of your dog and its personality, but steps to take often include:Blocking access to stairs that may lead to areas you do not want your dog, or that may be harmful to small puppies
Covering trash cans without lids
Securing low-set cabinets that the dog may be able to access, especially if you keep food or cleaning products in them
Moving or blocking anything with sharp corners or edges that could cut
Covering toilets, especially those with sanitizing flush products
Ensuring you have a fenced-in yard or area for your dog to spend time outside
Removing or barricading any potentially harmful plants, such as fruits, vegetables, and palm trees, in your yard or homeAssessing other areas as needed

, Once you have found a dog you like and you have prepared yourself and your home for their arrival, start the adoption process by filling out the necessary paperwork with the shelter or rescue. Let the shelter know that you are ready to adopt, confirm the dog you want is still available, and ask them to send you a copy of the adoption paperwork.


Adoption paperwork can be a lengthy process. It may require not only your name and address, but contact information for your vet, personal references, and even statements regarding why you want to adopt and what you have done to prepare.
Understand that shelters are trying to ensure that the dogs find loving, caring, permanent homes that will be able to provide for the dog throughout its life. Fill out the paperwork as completely as possible.

, Most shelters or rescues charge an adoption fee that helps cover the cost of rescuing and caring for the dog, including spaying or neutering the pet and providing vet care after rescue. Fees vary depending upon the dog’s age, breed, and needs, as well what type of care and training the shelter provided.Make sure your method of payment is accepted at your shelter. You may not be able to adopt, for example, if you were planning on using a credit card but the shelter only takes cash or check.
Contact the shelter to find out what the adoption fee will be for your pet, if they have not already provided you with that information.

, Some shelters require a home visit before they allow you to adopt a dog. Ask your shelter if this is one of their requirements, and if so set up a date and time to have your visit.Ask your shelter about the parameters of the visit in advance. Will it be a day visit, or will it be overnight? Will the shelter provide food, a bed, and some toys? What do you need to supply?
The goal of a visit is generally to ensure that you can properly care for the dog. Ask what sort of documentation you need provide from the visit to demonstrate this.
Make sure you have the time. It is ill-advised to leave the dog alone during a home visit. Make sure you have your errands for the day completed before the dog arrives, and take time off work or school if necessary to spend the day with the dog.

, Once you have filled out all of the paperwork and received the shelter’s approval, you are ready to bring your new pet home. Set up a time to pick up your pet from the shelter and bring them to their new, permanent home.Make sure you have proper transportation. Even if your local public transit systems allow pets on board, it may be a scary or confusing trip for your dog, and they could lash out. Make sure you have a car or a ride lined up to get your pet home quickly and with minimal stress.
Arrange to pick your pet up on a day where you will be able to stay with it the whole day. Your new dog will likely be confused and a little scared. Leaving them alone for extended periods right after you bring them home won’t help that. Take the day to get to know your new dog, and help acclimate them to their new environment.

, If you bring home a puppy, they may have lots of energy that needs to be properly cared for. Enroll you and your puppy in a basic behavioral training class. This will not only teach your puppy proper behavior, it will help you learn how to deal with some of their less-adorable actions and habits.The key to training is consistency. Attend every class, and practice commands and behaviors at home in between classes.
Consider further training if your puppy still needs some discipline after they finish their basic puppy training.
Local pet stores often have training classes for both puppies and newly adopted pets. Contact a local store to see if they offer classes, or to get recommendations for local trainers.

, It is important for your new dog to be able to interact with both other dogs and people in a healthy, respectful way. Socialize your dog by introducing them to other dogs and new people, and training them to properly interact.Understand that this may take time with a rescued animal. Rescue animals can be shy or cautious. It is important to offer the the opportunity to socialize, but do not force them into any action. This could cause harm to both your dog and whomever they interact with.
Start with exposure to friends and family in the home. Allow your dog to meet new people in familiar surroundings before leaving them with new people for any extended period of time.
Try a dog park to get your dog socializing with other dogs.
If you believe your new dog may be too aggressive to socialize with other dogs or people, work with a behavioral specialist to help train them. This often comes from previous training, or a place of fear within the dogs. Proper training can help them learn proper behavior with positive reinforcement.

, Even if the shelter provided vet work for your new dog, it is important to get your dog a vet check once you bring them home. This allows your dog and your vet to get to know one another. It also lets your vet assess your new pet and set them up on the right care plan for their needs.Call your vet and let them know that you have a new dog. Ask to set up an initial visit to introduce your dog to your vet and set up a care package for your pet.

, Your new dog is likely being asked to understand a great deal of information all at once. On top of that, they may be dealing with their own mental stresses from their abandonment or life in their former home. Practice patience and understanding with your new dog as they acclimate to their new home.Avoid stereotypical but often harmful reinforcement behaviors such as hitting the dog, even lightly, with a rolled up newspaper or rubbing their nose in spots where they have an “accident.”
Reward positive behaviors with affection, affirmation, and treats. Try not to react at all to negative behaviors unless they pose an immediate threat to the dog or someone else.
Work with a trainer or behavioral specialist, if necessary, to find the right set of training techniques for you and your pet.
Do not give up on your new dog if they do not act the way you want right away. Keep working with them and reinforcing good behavior.

Certain medical conditions, such as arthritis, could affect how your dog responds during the testing process. If the medical conditions are not known or diagnosed beforehand, the tester may misinterpret your dog’s responses to the different testing exercises., The more information on your dog that the tester has before conducting the test, the better he/she will be able to evaluate him. For example, write down your dog’s breed, age, sex, and reproductive status (intact, spayed, neutered). You should write down information on how your dog generally reacts to other people and other animals, as well as if your dog has had any prior obedience training.If you do not know your dog's breed, you can have your dog DNA tested. Dog DNA tests, which use cheek swabs, can be purchased online or at your local pet store; tests usually begin at about $60. The tests have variable accuracy, so talk with your veterinarian first about which DNA test he/she recommends.It is also important for the tester to know if your dog has, or has previously shown, aggressive behavior. If your dog has been aggressive, you will need to specify his aggression (food aggressive, aggressive towards people, etc)., In addition to having a full history of your dog, the tester will also need to know about you, especially in terms of your experience with dog ownership and dog training. It would also be helpful for the tester to know about your home environment (young children, other pets) and your ability to provide additional training that your dog may need as a result of the testing.Make sure to be honest and complete when providing information about yourself and your dog., Before the test, make sure that your dog’s collar and leash are sturdy. The tester will take your dog through a number of exercises, so it will be very important that your dog's collar and leash are in good shape.If either are in need of replacement, purchase them well enough in advance of the test so that your dog is used to them.


In addition to a collar and leash, you may also need a food bowl, some of your dog’s toys, and a chair.The equipment needed depends on the type of temperament test your dog will undergo.
It’s also helpful to have a notebook or computer where you can write down your dog’s responses while he’s being tested.You could also use your smartphone or a video recorder to record your dog during testing.

, The testing should be done in a controlled environment where there are no other distractions. This environment should be unfamiliar to your dog.If you are unsure where to have your dog temperament tested, your veterinarian may be able to recommend a location.

, It is very important to have your dog tested and handled by someone that he doesn’t already know. This increases the likelihood that the testing will be as objective as possible. It is also important to select an expert who is highly trained in conducting temperament tests.


If you are testing your dog’s suitability for a specific purpose (hunting, service dog, etc), then select a tester who is an expert in that particular area.During the testing, your handler will not be able to give your dog any correction or guidance, unless directed by the tester.
If you are unsure where to start with selecting a tester, conduct an internet search of local temperament testing companies to find out more about their testers and testing services.

Adopt your foster dog.",How to Foster Senior Dogs," If you have experience with a particular breed of dog, it is probably best to apply to foster a senior dog of that breed. Your knowledge of food and care for that breed will be invaluable as a foster parent and the rescue organization will be pleased to find you. If you feel a connection to a particular senior dog who needs a foster parent, you may want to honor this feeling., Ask your veterinarian if they know about a reputable dog rescue organization in your area. You should also ask them if they know of a rescue organization that has the specific breed you are looking for. Many rescue organizations have a hard time caring for older dogs and depend on compassionate foster parents, so they will be happy to hear from you.Search the Petfinder website for a local rescue organization: https://www.petfinder.com/animal-shelters-and-rescues/search


, Start by asking the rescue organization for an application to foster a senior dog. If you visit the organization in person, they should be able to give you a paper copy of the application. You can also start getting to know the people at the rescue, with whom you will have to work closely as a foster parent. You may also be able to email the rescue to request an application form., Look at the details of the foster application. You want to find out what the rescue organization requires of the foster parent in terms of costs, everyday care, and finding the senior dog a forever home. You should ask the rescue organization a number of key questions about costs and care:What costs will I incur as a foster parent?
Do you continue to pay for veterinary costs while I foster the senior dog?
Will I be paying for dog food?
How much assistance is offered in finding the senior dog a permanent home?
How are visits scheduled with prospective adopting parents?

, You will need to finish the application process, which may involve personal and veterinary reference checks. You should make sure you give the rescue organization good references for both your character and your animal husbandry abilities. Finally, you may need to let the rescue organization inspect your home and yard to determine suitability for fostering., Typically, the rescue organization will take care of veterinary costs but you will have to pay for dog food and perhaps some other incidentals like leashes. You should allocate sufficient financial resources to foster a senior dog such as money for food, shelter, and whatever additional costs are not covered by the rescue organization., Senior dogs may have any number of ailments and behavioral disorders. Prior to taking in a senior dog, you should make sure you know how to deal with its’ various ailments or behavioral issues. You may also need an open heart and a sense of humor.


If the senior dog is in a wheelchair, make sure you know how to operate a dog wheelchair. Ask the rescue organization for information on wheelchair operation.
If the senior dog has aggression issues, make sure you have some experience with training aggressive dogs.
If the senior dog has a specific medical condition, remember to ask the rescue organization for appropriate care information.

, Take the time to give your senior dog some exercise or a walk around the block. You will also need to spend some time just hanging out with your senior dog. As a whole, you may spend an hour a day caring for your senior dog. If you have other dogs, you can probably allocate this time for all of your dogs by taking them on walks together and hanging out as a family., You can purchase senior dog food formulations. You might also want to check with your rescue organization for dietary recommendations when you take in your foster dog. In general, senior dogs do better on low-calorie diets because they need less energy and are at risk of becoming overweight., If you encounter circumstances in your life that make fostering unmanageable, you should contact your rescue organization. Since moving is stressful for senior dogs, you should try to avoid the scenario of having to return your foster dog. If your situation is dire, you should give your rescue organization at least a few weeks of warning so that they can find a replacement foster home for your senior dog., Socialize with other dog owners and let the community know that you are currently fostering a senior dog from a rescue organization. By talking to fellow dog owners in your community, you may be able to identify a prospective permanent home for your senior dog. If you find a prospective owner for your foster dog, you should connect them with the rescue organization. The rescue organization will be in touch with you and the prospective owner about next steps in the adoption process.

, Your rescue organization will receive inquiries about adoption, so it is important to remind them that you have a foster dog in your home. Your rescue organization may use a number of tools, networks and events to link foster dogs with permanent homes.Your rescue organization may schedule visits with adopting parents at your home or elsewhere. You should ask them how this works.

, Post pictures and information about your foster dog on Facebook, Instagram, twitter and other social media. If you let people in your network know about your friendly and loving senior dog, hopefully the word will get out and a friend or acquaintance will jump at the opportunity to offer the foster dog a permanent home., If you cannot find a community adoption event in your area, talk to your rescue organization and community members about planning an event. Adoption events are a great way of promoting animal welfare and connecting foster dogs to permanent homes.Find a suitable date and location. Try to find a date that does not conflict with other major events in your region and a location that is accessible to a wide range of pet enthusiasts.Determine your budget. You should budget for food, drinks, marketing, pet supplies, cleaning, and any rental fees for the event location.Promote your event at the dog park and on social media.
Collect donations for senior dogs at the event.
Find people to adopt senior dogs.

, If you grow attached to your foster dog after many months, you may also choose to adopt it. Alternately, if you cannot find a suitable permanent home after a long time trying, you may decide to simply adopt your foster dog. If you make this decision, you should talk to your rescue organization about next steps in adopting the dog.

Observe your dog’s response to a stranger.,
Evaluate how your dog responds to noise.,
Evaluate your dog’s response to a sudden visual stimulus.,
Observe how your dog walks on an unfamiliar surface.,
Test your dog’s self-protective or aggressive behavior.,
Use the results to guide your training.",How to Temperament Test a Dog2," The exercises in this section are part of the American Temperament Testing Society, Inc temperament test. For this test, the handler should not be familiar with the dog; an expert tester will evaluate your dog’s responses. The objective of this first exercise is to evaluate how your dog responds to a non-threatening stranger.The first stranger will be neutral — he will approach and shake hands with the handler, then engage the handler in a short conversation while ignoring the dog. This interaction tests how your dog responds to passive socialization (when no one is interacting with your dog), and whether he has a protective instinct when a stranger approaches.The second type of stranger will be friendlier, and will actively engage with the dog. This will evaluate your dog’s active socialization., For this exercise, your dog will be exposed to different noises. The first noise will be hidden — someone other than the handler will rattle a metal bucket of rocks from a hidden position, then set the bucket in the path of the handler and your dog. This will evaluate your dog’s level of curiosity (will your dog investigate the bucket?) and alertness.The second noise will be a gunshot. Someone who is standing a distance back from the handler will fire three gunshots. This tests how your dog responds to a sudden, loud noise.Each person in the testing vicinity will be safely out of harm’s way when the gun is fired.

, Your dog and his handler will approach someone who is sitting in a chair with a closed umbrella. When your dog and the handler are about five feet away, the other person will open the umbrella. The tester will be looking to see how your dog reacts to something in his path that he wasn’t expecting., The handler will have your dog walk on two types of unfamiliar surfaces: a 15 x 6 foot (4.6 x 1.8 meter) plastic strip and a 12 x 3 foot (3.7 x 0.9m) unfolded exercise pen. For this exercise, the tester will evaluate how your dog responds when he’s walking on an unusual surface. (Is he fearful of the new surface? Can he get over that fear? Does he demonstrate curiosity while walking on the surface?), This exercise is conducted in multiple steps to observe how your dog responds to an unusual situation that becomes increasingly threatening. In the first part of this exercise, your dog and his handler will stop at a designated point and an oddly dressed stranger will cross about 40 feet (12m) in front of them. The tester will be watching to see if your dog recognizes this as unusual.Next, this stranger will walk closer to your dog and his handler (about 30 ft / 9m), as if to provoke them. At this point, your dog should start to perceive that the situation is starting to escalate.The stranger will then walk even closer (about 20 f / 6m), this time more aggressively. At this point, the trainer evaluates your dog’s protective instincts. Different breeds have varying levels of protective instincts, so your dog’s breed will be taken into consideration as his protective response is evaluated., No dog is perfect for every situation. Your dog may be great in some situations, and not so great in others. Hopefully, the temperament test has helped you identify these areas. In future training, focus on the areas where your dog needs improvement."

Perform the rollover test.,
Gently squeeze your puppy’s paws.,
Pet your puppy all over.,
Pick up your puppy.,
Watch how your puppy approaches people and other littermates.,
Clap your hands.,
Test the puppy's reaction to food.",How to Temperament Test a Dog3," Testing a puppy’s temperament is something that you could do on your own. Alternatively, select a tester who knows the genetics of your puppy’s litter.To perform the rollover test, roll your puppy onto his back and hold him there about 15 seconds by gently placing your hand on his chest. Observe how much he resists being held this way.A dominant puppy will show resistance for the entire time that you are holding him. A more submissive puppy will put up little to no resistance, and may start licking you (another sign of submission)., With your puppy standing on all fours, hold down both of his front paws by covering them with your hands and using gentle pressure. Hold his paws like this for about one minute, then do the same with his back paws. Use just enough pressure on his paws to keep him in place, not to hurt him. Just like with the rollover test, observe his level of resistance to being held.Pain will cause your puppy to resist regardless of whether he’s dominant or submissive, so it is important not to inflict any pain while temperament testing your puppy.

, Gently touch his ears, his legs, his belly, etc. Lightly tug on his ears. Pay close attention to how he responds to you. Whether he seems to enjoy it, tries to get away from you, or even tries to bite you, he will be giving you good clues of his overall temperament.Keep in mind that puppy biting is normal puppy behavior, even though it may hurt; it is a puppy’s way of investigating their environment.Puppy biting can be problematic, though, if you do not train your puppy to stop biting as he grows older., Pick him up by interlacing your fingers on his belly (palms facing up), and lifting him in the air. Hold him there for about 30 seconds. If he starts to squirm and wants to be put down, he has a more dominant and independent behavior. If he seems quite content for you to hold him in this way, he is showing more submissive behavior and may even try to start licking you., This will give you a very good indication of his dominant or submissive behavior. If your puppy is showing dominance, he will approach other people and his littermates with an upright posture and perky ears. On the other hand, if he is submissive, he will walk with his head lowered and ears leaning back; he will probably also hunch over a little.If the puppy is glued to your side, it may be insecure. If it shies away, it may have a fearful personality. A puppy that ignores you completely is probably independent, and one that explores the room but comes back to you is confident.

, The goal of this exercise is to observe your puppy’s response to sudden noises. Whether he responds with interest, fear, aggression, or indifference will let you know what kind of temperament he has.Throwing your keys on the ground can be a good alternate test of this response. Most puppies will jump back initially, but confident ones will quickly come over to investigate the new object.

, Try petting the puppy while it is eating, then taking the puppy's food away as it eats, and pushing the puppy away. If the puppy tries to play tug-of-war with the dish, or tries to crowd your hand out of the bowl, it is more dominant. If the puppy willingly relents, it is more submissive.


If the puppy reacts aggressively, it may have an issue with food aggression, sometimes called ""resource guarding."" This is a serious issue, but fortunately it is easier to correct in puppies than in adults.
If the puppy is large enough to injure you, use a broom handle or other long object to push the food away. Never test an adult dog this way with your bare hand.

Understand why BDS occurs.,
Train the black dog.,
Use a bright background when photographing a dark dog, even a quilt will do.,
Sell the breed, not the color.,
Make good points out of bad points.,
Tell everyone to spay and neuter all their pets.",How to Understand and Help Prevent Black Dog Syndrome," If you're going to tackle the problem of BDS, then you need to understand the motivations behind it in order to respond to them. There are quite a number of possible reasons for BDS (these are theories as there are no hard facts on the phenomenon):The most common reason people don't like to adopt these dogs is due to their perceived aggressiveness. The stereotypical aggressive rottweilers, doberman pinschers, and some breeds of pit bull, give all big, dark colored dogs a bad name.






When looking at a black lab and a golden retriever, most people will choose the golden retriever as the ""safe"" dog.






Another reason people don't tend to adopt black dogs is guilt by association. Black cats, and other dark animals, have always had negative superstitions associated with them. This negative association seems to carry over to dogs as well, since almost all dogs used for security purposes have dark coats to make them appear more menacing.






The concept of black for evil and white for good in many things from books to movies might have an impact on some people. Hollywood seems to favor this approach, possibly because black dogs are harder to photograph. Also, ""the black dog"" is a term applied to depression, making some people associate black dogs with feeling down.






Black dogs are also thought to shed more hair than lighter colored dogs. This is untrue, but since the black hair may be more visible on light surfaces, this ""nuisance factor"" is yet another reason people don't adopt black dogs.
Another reason people don't tend to adopt large black dogs, is that they 'go gray' in the muzzle area earlier. This makes them look older than they really are, and most people don't want to adopt a dog 'past his prime'.





;
, Several cute tricks may be the ticket to help get a black dog adopted. A higher education is many dogs' hope for a successful interview with a new family.


See How to train a dog, How to teach a dog to drop it, How to teach your dog to take your socks off, and How to teach your dog to hold an object for just a few of many training ideas.

, Dark dogs don't stand out in photos, so they don't tend to look their best photographed in a shelter. Black is a difficult color to photograph well, so select someone from the shelter staff or volunteers who loves a photography challenge!


If your camera has a ""fill-in flash"", use it. Hopefully the photo will then show the dog's eyes and face.
Read How to take pictures of your black pet for more hints on good photography.

, Think of all the qualities of the breed that will suit the person who might be adopting the dog and make these a strong selling point. For instance, rottweilers and dobermans are both very loyal breeds, and would be good for a one-master home. Perhaps print up a card or make a poster with the great new photo of the black dog and point out all the excellent traits of the dog's breed, using bullet points to make them stand out.

, If the person considering the adoption of a dog says something like, ""Oh, but he's too big!"", promote the qualities of a big dog. Large dogs may be much more laid back than smaller, more energetic breeds, and also many large breeds have been shown to get along better with other dogs, which can be helpful for an owner looking to create a multi dog household. (Just make sure these qualities actually apply to the dog you are trying to get adopted.) If the person wants a dog for security, point out that people tend to be more afraid of black dogs than dogs of lighter colors.

, None of the black dogs came on a UFO from a distant planet; each came from a non-fixed pair of pets, as a result of poor human decision-making (or lack thereof). Encourage all owners to be responsible by having the dogs spayed or neutered before they leave the shelter (include the cost in the adoption price).

Explain that senior dogs are already trained.,
Reveal that older dogs are calmer and less energetic.,
Inform customers that senior dogs are not always problem dogs.",How to Encourage Senior Dog Adoption1," One of the benefits of adopting a senior dog instead of a puppy, is that most senior dogs are already trained. When adopting a senior dog, you will not need to worry about the dog going to the bathroom in the house. They have likely already developed this skill. Similarly, senior dogs will already be able to follow a number of basic commands such as sit, stay, and come. Essentially adopting a young dog is a lot of work and they will require constant attention and lots of training.Senior dogs can also easily learn new commands and tricks, contrary to popular belief.;
, Senior dogs will require some form of daily exercise. Typically this can be achieved in the form of a short walk or game of fetch in the backyard. Puppies, however, have a lot of energy and will require ample amounts of daily exercise. Explain that before adopting a dog, you should consider the amount of time you can devote to providing your dog with exercise. A senior dog is likely the better choice if you are looking for a calmer and less energetic companion.Senior dogs are also less likely to cause destruction in the home. For instance, a puppy is more apt to chew on your rug or couch as a way to burn off energy.

, Many people believe that rescue dogs, especially senior rescue dogs, have behavioural issues as a result of their previous living conditions. Although this is true in some instances, it is not a general rule for senior dog adoption. Senior dogs are put up for adoption for a variety of reasons. As a result, many senior dogs that are available for adoption have no real behaviour issues and make great companions and family pets.For example, sometimes people are forced to give up their pet because they are moving, the dog’s owner died, the novelty of owning a dog wore off, loss of a job, or the family circumstances changed.

It would not be fair to you or your puppy to bring him home when you are not truly ready for, or committed to, caring for him. Asking yourself a few questions—and answering them honestly—will help you determine if you are ready to take on the responsibility of buying a puppy.


Do I have the time groom, train, and exercise my puppy?Puppies are very time-intensive—although some breeds are more laid back than others, you will need to devote a lot of time to properly caring for your puppy. If you have a busy schedule or are out of town a lot, you may need to reconsider if you will be able to make time to take care of a puppy.
Am I financially able to cover the costs of caring for a puppy?There’s no getting around the fact that puppies are expensive. Think about if you are ready to pay for all of the necessities (food, collar, toys, bedding, etc.) plus regular and unexpected veterinary visits.Is anyone at my house allergic to dogs?If you do not live alone, you should consider whether anyone else who lives with you is allergic to dogs or pet dander in general.;
, Research breeds with characteristics (e.g., small dog, calm temperament, etc.) that make them a good fit for your life situation. The AKC has a matching quiz (http://www.akc.org/find-a-match) that can help you choose a breed. Dogs come in all shapes, sizes and personalities. Choosing the wrong breed can result in heartbreak for all if you realize that he is not a good fit for your home. A few examples of important factors to keep in mind include your living situation (apartment vs home)and work schedule (regular work hours vs constant travel).


Consider the energy level of the breed. For example, if you don't enjoy being outdoors much, getting a Siberian husky probably isn't the best idea. Huskies love to jump and run, and they need hours of daily exercise. It may be better to choose a puppy who will grow up to be a dog that likes napping and hanging out with you at home, such as a Cavalier King Charles.
If you rent, your apartment may have breed and weight restrictions for dogs. In addition, a large dog who needs a lot of exercise, such as a Golden Retriever, may feel a bit stifled in an apartment.If your apartment complex allows larger dogs, you will need to make sure that you have easy access to a large fenced-in area or dog park where you dog will be able run and exercise.
Talking to a reputable breeder could help you narrow down which breed would be an ideal fit for your life situation.Other than doing Internet searches of dog breeds, consider purchasing a book on dog breeds.Keep in mind that you do not have to pick a specific breed. A mutt will do just fine!

, Aside from the initial cost of purchasing the puppy, factor in how much you will need to spend on food, toys, cleaning and grooming supplies, and veterinary care. By creating a budget, you will have a more realistic expectation of the monthly costs associated with having a puppy at home.Depending on the breed and size, buying a puppy could cost between $100 and $150 per month in the first year.Do not forget to factor in costs of smaller items, such as collars, leashes, identification tags, and treats.Purchasing a puppy from a breeder will likely be more expensive than adopting a puppy from a shelter.

, Chances are that your home is not ready for a puppy. Similar to making a home safe for children, you will need to make your home safe for your puppy. For example, keep your trash cans hidden or well out of reach. You may need to invest in child-proof latches if your puppy figures out how to open cupboards.Place covers over electrical outlets so that your puppy cannot lick them.Keep all medications, cleaning supplies, and antifreeze hidden and out of reach. These can all be toxic to your puppy.If you have a garage, secure heavy tools to the wall. Make sure to pick up any loose screws that your puppy could easily eat off the garage floor., You will likely be taking to your puppy to the veterinarian fairly regularly during his first year of life, and at least once a year after that. It will be important for you to find a veterinarian that you feel comfortable with.Rather than doing an online search of local veterinary offices, you may want to seek recommendations of good veterinarians from local breeders, other dog owners, or your local pet store.

, If you have a particular breed in mind, look online to find out which shelters currently have adoptable puppies. Online resources like Petfinder.org provide listings of puppies and dogs from hundreds of shelters. You can search by breed, size, gender, and age to find the right puppy for you, then contact the shelter directly to proceed with the adoption.You may have to travel out of your city to get a particular breed. Consider expanding your search to include shelters within a few hundred miles of your home for best results.
Some rare or expensive breeds may not be available in shelters. However, there are breed-specific rescue groups that may have the breed (or designer breed, such as a Labradoodle) that you are looking for.Animal shelters and rescue groups often conduct behavioral tests (also known as temperament tests) to determine if a puppy is a good candidate for adoption.Even with the additional costs of spaying/neutering, microchipping, vaccinating, and deworming, adopting a puppy from an animal shelter or rescue is usually less expensive than going through a breeder or paying for all of these services separately., If you are not as particular about what type of breed you want, consider going to a shelter to meet puppies in person.When you are the shelter, ask questions about the puppies’ history and behavior. Also, try to observe the activities at the shelter to determine if the dogs are well taken care of.


Animal shelters can be stressful environments for dogs because of the noise, number of dogs, and high level of general activity. Some dogs may develop behavioral problems while at the shelter. The staff at the shelter should inform you if the puppy you are interested in has any behavioral issues.

, Asking questions at an animal shelter is just as important as asking a breeder questions. For example, you will want to ask about where the animals came from (e.g., stray, given up by previous owner). It would also be helpful to learn how long the puppy that you are interested in has been at the shelter.Ask questions about the puppy's medical history and how his behavior has been at the shelter. His behavior at the shelter may be different than what it could be at your home.Ask about the shelter's procedure for pets who get sick shortly after they are adopted. Because of a shelter's limited budget for veterinary care, be aware that you may responsible for a majority, if not all, of your puppy's medical expenses after you adopt him.You can also ask if the shelter is a ""no-kill"" shelter. This type of shelter does not euthanize animals after they have been at the shelter for a certain amount of time., Be aware that you may not be able to adopt a puppy on the same day that you go to the animal shelter or rescue group. Commonly, there will be an interview process in which the staff will give you the full history and medical background of the puppy.There may also be a home visit where a member of the staff will visit your home to determine if your home environment is suitable for the puppy.


Don’t be surprised if you are interviewed as well. The staff will need assurance that you will be a responsible pet owner and take good care of your puppy.
In addition to the interview and potential home visit, you will need to fill out the necessary paperwork and pay the adoption fee (usually $100 to $200).

, The animal shelters or rescue groups in your area may not have the exact breed that you want. Fortunately, they tend to have a high turnover of animals, so it may not be long before the perfect puppy for you is at the animal shelter or rescue group. Check back with them regularly to learn what breeds of dogs they have acquired., Not all breeders are reputable, so you will want to know which ones to consider and which ones to avoid if you want to buy a puppy through a breeder. One type of breeder is a hobby show breeder. Hobby show breeders are highly knowledgeable about a dog breed and invest considerable time and energy into selecting an optimal pedigree and raising show quality puppies. These breeders will typically raise only one or two litters per year.


Backyard breeders typically have very little knowledge about dog breeds and are probably just trying to make a little money on the side. Avoid buying a puppy from a backyard breeder.
Commercial breeders typically house several different dog breeds and produce numerous litters in a year. The physical environment of a commercial breeder may or may not be of good quality. In addition, not all commercial breeders produce AKC registration papers. Puppies that you see in pet stores may come from commercial breeders.

, Check with local veterinarians and dog breed organizations to find a breeder with a reputation for taking good care of his or her dogs. He or she should breed just a few types of dogs and have a strong relationship with local veterinarians and other animal organizations. The ASPCA has a helpful list of responsible breeders.A responsible breeder will ask you questions about why you want a dog, who will be taking care of it and where it will live. He or she will not simply take your cash and hand over a puppy., You should never purchase a puppy through a breeder without having visited the breeder’s location. It is very important that you see where your puppy, his littermates, and his parents were housed and raised.A responsible breeder will actually encourage you to visit multiple times so that you completely comfortable with his or her physical location and business practices.

, Buying a puppy through a breeder can be very expensive, so you want to be sure that the breeder is honest, knowledgeable, and ethical. There are many questions that you can ask the breeder: How are the puppies raised and socialized? How do you screen potential puppy buyers? What is your procedure during whelping (birthing process)? Have the parents been tested for breed-specific diseases?


You can ask other questions regarding how many puppies were in the litter and what medical care they have received (vaccinating, deworming, etc.).Ask for documentation regarding medical care, microchipping, and screening for breed-specific behavioral or medical issues.Don’t be afraid to ask questions. If the breeder is reputable, he or she will have no problem answering any and all questions that you have about them and the dogs he or she breeds and raises.
Be ready to answer questions as to why you want a puppy and how you plan to take care of it. A good breeder will be very concerned about the welfare of the puppies he or she has bred. Forming a good relationship with a breeder can be very helpful if you have questions later in the puppy's life, or if you are interested in showing the puppy later.

, You will also need to obtain a contract of sale. If you are interested in showing or breeding the puppy you buy, you will need proof that he is registered with the AKC and that you are the legal owner.Be aware, though, that AKC papers tell you who your puppy’s parents are and are not proof that your puppy was raised properly by the breeder.Be wary of a breeder who tries to sell you a puppy since simply because he or she has papers showing the puppy’s lineage.

, Puppy mills are notorious for mass breeding of puppies in deplorable conditions. Breeders who run puppy mills are typically more concerned with making a profit than practicing responsible breeding practices.Puppies bred in this type of environment may have genetic abnormalities that could lead to physical and emotional disorders that, unfortunately, you won’t discover right away.


When you visit a breeder, take a close look at the conditions. If the dogs there look dirty, skinny or unhealthy, do not purchase a puppy there.
If a breeder is reluctant to show you his or her entire premises, it is probable that he or she is running a puppy mill and does not want you to see the poor conditions in which the dogs are being bred and raised.If a breeder does not ask you a lot of questions and takes a hands-off approach to the puppy's care after he or she has sold it, you should suspect that he or she is running a puppy mill.Breeders who claim to breed a large number of purebreds or ""designer"" breeds are likely not telling you the truth and are probably running a puppy mill.The dogs are most likely not purebred or a designer breed.
You might want to report a puppy mill to the authorities. You can fill out a report at http://www.humanesociety.org/forms/report_a_puppy_mill.html or call 1-877-MILL-TIP if you suspect a breeder you visit is harming dogs and puppies.

, Puppies in pet stores can come from puppy mills.Do your due diligence—ask the staff at the pet store where they obtain their puppies and research the breeders that they mention. If you are going to buy a puppy from a pet store, you should be confident the puppies come from reputable animal shelters and/or breeders.

, Puppies are ready to be adopted between eight and twelve weeks of age, at which time they are weaned from their mothers, able to eat solid food, and have received the first round of vaccinations.A puppy may look healthy at first glance but, upon closer inspection, may have some physical abnormalities. If you see signs that the puppy is not in good health, you may need to reconsider adopting the puppy. A good way to physically exam a puppy is start at the head and work your way to the tail.There are many aspects of a puppy’s physical appearance to examine. If you are not sure that you can do a thorough examination, consider asking the breeder or staff at the animal shelter or rescue group to guide you through the process.
Examine the puppy’s head. For example, the nose should be cool and wet with no discharge. The gums should be a healthy pink color. Also, the eyes should look clear and bright and have a dark pupil. The ears should be clean and positioned according to specific breed characteristics.Put your hand on the puppy’s chest to feel the heartbeat. An abnormal heartbeat could indicate a genetic heart defect which could require veterinary care.Examine the puppy’s coat. If he is purebred, his coat should match the breed standard. In general, the puppy’s hair should be shiny and smooth without areas of hair loss.Look at the puppy’s legs. His legs should be straight without structural deformities (e.g., legs that bow in or out). You may want a breeder or veterinarian to do a more detailed orthopedic examination of the puppy., Whether you're getting your puppy from a shelter or a breeder, take time to assess the puppy's personality before you make your decision. For example, watch a litter of puppies and see how they play together. Puppies in the same litter usually have different personalities, and you'll want to pick the one that will make the best pet for you.


Puppies with a good combination of energy and sweetness make the best pets.Look for a puppy that's playful and energetic, but not too rough with the others.
Avoid picking a puppy that seems overly aggressive or extremely shy.

, Make sure you have a good connection with the puppy you have chosen before you seal the deal. If the puppy shies away or tucks his tail between his legs when you approach, he may not have the best temperament to become a pet. If you like the puppy's personality but aren't sure how he'll get along with your children or other pets, you may be able to foster the puppy to help you decide.Keep in mind that puppies also choose their owners. The puppy you are interested in will probably be paying attention to you see if he is comfortable around you."

Locate local breeders.,
Ask about the breeder’s experience.,
Ask about health considerations.,
Do not buy from a pet store.,
Insist on visiting the premises.,
Read the breeder’s behaviour.",How to Buy a Cocker Spaniel Puppy1," Aim to buy a purebred puppy from a responsible local Cocker Spaniel breeder. It is a good idea to visit a few local breeders before choosing one from which to buy a puppy. Check local classified listings, talk to area vets, attend dog shows, visit dog parks, and ask other local Cocker Spaniel owners for referrals to reputable breeders. It's best to shop locally so you can meet the puppy first and establish a relationship with a knowledgeable breeder.


Browse the database of Cocker Spaniel breeders at the American Spaniel Club (ASC) website to look for ASC-registered breeders in your state: http://www.asc-cockerspaniel.org/index.php/breeders.html
;
, Ask how many years of experience the breeder has; ideally, they should have at least a few years of experience. Also, ask if they only breed Cocker Spaniel puppies or other breeds as well. If they specialize in Cocker Spaniels, they are more likely to be knowledgeable about them. Be polite and direct with questions like:""Have you been a breeder for many years?""
""Have you only bred Cocker Spaniels?""

, Making sure that your new puppy is healthy is of the utmost concern, and it should be a breeder's primary concern as well. Be sure to ask your breeder if the puppies’ mother is current on her vaccines, as puppies receive their early immunity to disease directly from their mother, and if either parent had any genetic defects. You should also inquire if the puppy will be seen by a vet before it is sold.Conditions like progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), cataracts, glaucoma, cardiomyopathy, and hip dysplasia are common in Cocker Spaniels, so ask if either parent of the litter has been afflicted with any of them., Almost all pet stores puppies come from puppy mills, which are essentially puppy factories with horrible, unhealthy conditions. Given the popularity of the Cocker Spaniel breed, many Cocker Spaniel puppies will be sold in pet stores. Buying your new puppy from a pet store, however, supports and perpetuates the puppy mill business that exploits and harms animals. Dogs raised in pet mills are also likely to carry parasites and suffer from health problems., If you contact a breeder to buy a puppy, make sure to visit the premises before going through with your purchase. Breeders who avoid your visit and offer to deliver the puppy to you are likely trying to hide the true conditions of their breeding operation. If you are not able to see the condition of your puppy’s first home, as well as the state of its mother, you should not trust the breeder you are dealing with., Given the popularity of Cocker Spaniels and their unfortunate appeal to exploitative breeders, you should be vigilant about who you are doing business with.Puppy mill breeders are concerned with profit above all else, so they will likely fall all over you to make the sale while evading questions about their business. Steer clear of any breeders who are  not forthcoming or secretive.Responsible breeders invest time and care into their puppies and are more likely to be choosy about who they do business with, and express interest in the conditions of the new home the dog will be going to.

Ask your veterinarian about exercising your dog on a water treadmill.,
Locate a veterinary clinic that has a water treadmill.,
Check your pet insurance.,
Ensure the facilities are clean.",How to Exercise a Senior Dog on a Water Treadmill1," If your senior dog is suffering from arthritis or is not getting enough exercise due to mobility issues, you should talk with your veterinarian about possible treatments. Ask your veterinarian if exercising your dog on a water treadmill would be beneficial for him. Although exercising your dog on a water treadmill can be good for some senior dogs, there are certain conditions that make this type of therapy inadvisable.For instance, if your dog also suffers from respiratory or cardiac disease, exercising your dog on a water treadmill may not be recommended. If your dog has arthritis, then using a water treadmill may not be recommended because of the increased resistance, which can be stressful on your dog’s joints.
Similarly, your dog should not use a water treadmill if they have skin sutures or cuts.;
, Many veterinary clinics are now offering water-based rehabilitation; however, it is still a relatively modern form of treatment. If your veterinary clinic does not have a water treadmill, ask your veterinarian to refer you to an appropriate clinic in the area.Ask what training the clinicians have received.

, If you have pet insurance, then this may cover some of the cost of water treadmill use for your dog. If your dog is using a water treadmill for exercise purposes, or as a result of arthritis, they may need to continue the therapy once a week for the rest of their life.Call the pet insurance company to find out if this cost is covered.


It is also possible that your pet insurance will not cover the cost of your dog using a water treadmill, so you may need to pay for this therapy yourself. Ask at your veterinarian’s office about the costs.

, It is a good idea to visit the facilities prior to allowing your dog to begin using the water treadmill. Make sure that the clinic is clean and that the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. A little bit of dog hair in the pool will not harm your dog, but it is good to know that the entire facility is clean. Bacteria and infections could spread between dogs if proper precautions are not taken.The water should be treated with chlorine each time the water is changed. For water treadmills this happens regularly.
Ask the clinician how often they change the water and what chemicals they use to clean.

Provide testimonials of successful senior dog adoptions.,
Post photos on social media sites of senior dogs looking to be adopted.,
Create special programs to adopt out senior dogs.",How to Encourage Senior Dog Adoption2," One way to encourage senior dog adoption, is to provide potential adopters with testimonials describing successful adoptions. These stories can be shared on the shelter website and included in brochures. Some people may be more likely to adopt a senior dog if they can learn about the positive experiences of previous adoptions. This will also help remove the stigma that senior dogs have behaviour issues.Testimonials can also explain that senior dogs can actually live for years once they are adopted.

, Another way to advertise senior dog adoption, is by posting photos on social media of dogs that are currently looking to be adopted. You can provide a few details about the dog including their age and temperament. These photos can be shared on a variety of social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. This is a great way to advertise the rescue agency as well as individual dogs seeking a home.You can also share the background stories of senior dogs to help motivate potential adopters. Some individuals will find these stories heartwarming and will look into adopting a specific dog as a result of its history.
For instance, you could write ""Fido is a Wheaton Terrier who is approximately 8 years old and was found in an abandoned building with no food or water. After receiving a thorough vet exam, Fido is doing great. This dog loves to cuddle and is looking for a forever home.""

, Many shelters will create special programs to help with adopting senior dogs. For instance, some shelters focus exclusively on senior dog adoptions and all of their promotional material is dedicated to senior dog adoption. Alternatively you could try providing extra incentives and programs for senior dog adoption. November, for example, is senior dog adoption month. Throughout the month of November your shelter could provide discounts and added incentives for senior dog adoption.You could also try reaching out to local media sources such as television, newspapers, and radio programs to help advertise senior dog adoption.

Pick the best of the litter.,
Make sure your puppy is the right age.,
Consider adopting a puppy.",How to Buy a Cocker Spaniel Puppy2," When choosing your puppy from a litter, try to pick a moderately tempered dog and avoid extremes (too energetic, or too withdrawn and skittish). Look for puppies that are calm, but also curious and friendly. As a breed, Cocker Spaniels are enthusiastic, agreeable, and affectionate, so these qualities should be evident the puppies you interact with.Make sure to spend some one-on-one time with your potential new puppy to evaluate it away from the rest of the litter., Before bringing home your new puppy, you should make sure that it is old enough to be taken away from its mother and the rest of its litter. Puppies need at least 8 weeks with their canine family to grow, learn, and mature enough to their full potential. During this initial period they will learn social skills, be weaned from their mother, grow teeth, and start eating solid food., Consider adopting a Cocker Spaniel puppy instead of buying one- you’ll not only save a life, but you’ll gain a new pet at a lower cost than buying a puppy from a breeder. Contact dog rescue groups in your area for a referral to other rescue groups that deal with Cocker Spaniels. Local animal shelters and veterinarian offices may also be able to provide referrals.

Set the water temperature.,
Let your dog get used to the water and equipment.,
Adjust the water level as therapy progresses.,
Adjust the water treadmill speed to the size of the dog.,
Completely dry the dog afterwards.",How to Exercise a Senior Dog on a Water Treadmill2," Make sure that the water temperature is relatively warm, between 80 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit (27-38 degrees Celsius). This warm water temperature will help to increase mobility and flexibility in aging dogs. It also helps to increase blood flow.If the water is too warm it can cause your dog to overheat.

, When you are first introducing your dog to using a water treadmill, you should start slowly. Your dog may be nervous around water and the equipment. Typically, the pet therapist will enter the tank with dog and stay with them throughout the first therapy session to make sure they are comfortable.If your dog is nervous around water, you should have them get used to walking on the treadmill first before filling up the tank with water. Most facilities will only add an inch or so of water to start, and then will gradually add more water as your dog gets used to the sensation.
Most dogs will eventually become accustomed to the equipment and will enjoy the exercise.
Dogs do not need to be able to swim because they will be able to touch the bottom at all times.
The clinician and/or veterinarian will evaluate your dog prior to treatment to make sure that exercise on a water treadmill is a suitable activity for your dog.

, Exercise on a water treadmill is an excellent option for senior dogs because of the added buoyancy that water provides. As your dog progresses through the treatment and muscle strengthening occurs, the pet therapist can decrease the amount of water to begin putting more pressure on the dog.As dogs age, they may develop sore muscles, stiff joints, arthritis or hip dysplasia. If you dog has one of these conditions, then using a water treadmill may not be ideal. He may do better with an exercise like swimming instead.
Initially, the pool will be filled with water to just below the dog's shoulder height.
Water will need to be adjusted specifically for each dog that uses the treadmill. You can do this by draining and adding water to the tank.

, The speed of the treadmill can also be adjusted to meet the needs of your dog. For instance, smaller dogs, with short legs, will generally walk at a slower speed than taller dogs. The clinician can also increase the speed throughout the exercise session in order to increase the water resistance and give your dog a better workout.Your dog should use the water treadmill once a week for 30 minutes at a time.

, Once your senior dog has completed an exercise session on a water treadmill, make sure that you thoroughly dry your dog. Older dogs will become colder more quickly than younger dogs. As a result, you should dry off the dog immediately once they get out of the water.Use a towel to dry the dog. This will help to remove some of the water. You can also use a blow drier to completely dry the dog once you get home.

Promote senior dog adoption to first time dog owners.,
Target senior citizens to adopt senior dogs.,
Find foster homes for senior dogs.",How to Encourage Senior Dog Adoption3," Older dogs are a great choice for first time dog owners because they do not require the same amount of attention or training as a young puppy. For first time dog owners, training can be a very difficult and time consuming task. As a result, adopting a senior dog, that is already trained, may help to ease the transition into life with a dog. Tell potential adoptees to talk with an individual who is currently raising a puppy in order to get a realistic idea of the amount of work and time involved.
If they are not interested in constantly cleaning up after the puppy, a senior dog may be the right choice for them.

, Senior dogs make excellent companions for senior humans. Companion animals, such as dogs, provide many benefits for the owner. For instance, they provide physical activity, increased social engagement, love and affection, and some believe they even contribute to lower blood pressure and cholesterol. As a result, senior dog adoption is a fantastic way to provide senior humans with companionship and purpose during the latter stages of life.Provide senior citizens with added incentives to adopt a senior dog. For example, some shelters provide senior citizens with a discount on adopting senior dogs. This could be as much as 50% off in order to help encourage senior dog adoption. Senior dogs can also come with a starter kit and food to help in the transition.

, At times it may be difficult to find an individual to adopt a senior dog from your shelter. An alternative to adoption is fostering. This means that an individual will provide a temporary home for the dog as it awaits permanent adoption. Fostering is an excellent option for people who are unable to commit to full time dog ownership, but want to help out dogs in need. Fostering a senior dog will help remove them from the stressful environment of the shelter.Advertise your foster program in the local media.

Understand shaping.,
Purchase a clicker.,
Introduce your dog to the soccer ball.,
Up the ante by making the criteria harder.,
Increase your criteria again to the dog moving the ball.",How to Train a Dog to Play Soccer," Shaping is a method of training that gradually builds a behavior until it is the required one. For example, if you were training a chicken to turn in a circle using shaping, you would first give the chicken seed for moving to the left, then for turning slightly to the left, then for turning halfway to the left, than turning completely in a circle. Shaping is what you will be using to train your dog to play soccer.;
, A clicker is a box-shaped plastic training instrument that has a metal part that, when pushed, makes a signature ""click"" noise. A clicker is used to mark the moment when the dog performs the desired behavior; for example, when the dog sits while being trained to sit - the dog will know the sitting is the behavior for which he is given a treat or other reward. Clicking a behavior is more exact than telling a dog ""Good dog!"" as a clicker has a distinctive sound and is easy to use at the exact moment the behavior occurs.


You should now charge the clicker. This is also know as loading the clicker. Charging the clicker means to teach the dog that the click sound means he is about to receive a treat. Cut up a hot dog or other highly desirable item, and call your dog. Click the clicker and reward your dog, click and reward, click and reward, etc. You can switch rewards later on in the training session to something more mundane such as kibble, but occasionally use a hot dog or other similar food to keep your dog's enthusiasm with the clicker high.

Clicker training relies on very exact timing - if training a dog to sit, for example, you must click the instant the dog sits, not when he's standing, as otherwise you will be rewarding him for standing. Before you start training this trick, practice your timing. Find a friend and a tennis ball, and ask the friend to slowly bounce the tennis ball. Every time the ball hits the ground, your goal is to click - ask your friend how well you're doing. If you practice this exercise frequently, soon your timing will be perfect!
After clicking your dog, you must give him a treat. Clicker training your dog is somewhat like employing him; you can't expect him to work without ""money,"" i.e. treats.

, The first step to training a dog to play soccer is to reward the dog for looking at the ball.


Before you begin this step, you should decide on your criteria. You will decide criteria for each step in this training process; deciding your criteria is deciding what you will click and what will be ignored. For this step, your criteria should be very low - shifting in the direction of or even looking at the ball is deserving of a click.
Choose a soccer ball that you won't mind getting a little beat up, and take it and your dog into a quiet room without distractions (other dogs, people, music, etc.). Bring small, soft treats you can split into little pieces and your dog can easily swallow. Click and reward your dog whenever he meets your criteria. If your dog refuses to look at the soccer ball, or is too interested in the treats, move the ball or otherwise catch his attention with it.

, To earn a click, your dog must now touch the ball with his paw.


This step is easier if you first train your dog the trick ""paws up,"" or when the dog puts his paws onto an object. Find a stable, box-shaped item, and encourage the dog to put his paws onto the item. Keep the hand holding the treat close enough to him that he doesn't think he should jump up onto the item altogether. You can first reward brushing the item with a single paw, and build up from there until your dog keeps both paws on the item until the click sounds, finishing the command.
You can encourage your dog to touch the ball with his paw by telling him to ""paws up"" on it; if he knows a trick such as ""high five"" or ""shake,"" you can also use that trick. Your dog may also be more likely to touch it with his paw if the ball is moving; experiment!
This step can be frustrating for dogs who do not understand what is wanted of them; to keep enthusiasm high, you can ask him for tricks he already knows well and click and reward him.

, In this training session, don't click and reward the dog simply touching the ball, but immediately click and reward if your dog pushes it, even if it only moves slightly.


Your criteria will have to be very exact, or you will confuse both your dog and yourself. ""My dog should move the soccer ball"" is not an exact enough criteria; on the other hand, ""My dog should lift its paw and move the soccer ball forward using its paw"" is good enough.

Ask yourself if you are ready to adopt.,
Check your finances.,
Run it by other people.,
Research what kind of dog you want.,
Try out dog ownership.",How to Adopt a Dog from a Humane Society or Animal Shelter1," Before you begin the adoption process, you should determine if you are really ready for a pet dog. Think about your current living conditions and ask a few questions. For example, is your living situation stable? And, are you ready to commit to a pet for the next 10-12 years? Do you have the time and energy for the daily needs of a dog?Try to plan your adoption for when you have free time to get your pet settled in. Avoid adopting a dog right before leaving on vacation.;
, Give some thought to the extra pet expenses and make sure they will not bust your budget. This includes dog food, treats, toys, bedding, training class, grooming, boarding and/or pet sitting, as well as unforeseen expenses like an occasional vet visit. Many people return pets to the shelter because they cannot afford the added expenses. Make sure you know the financial responsibilities ahead of time.On average, a new pet will cost you at least $1,000 in the first year and $500 each subsequent year you own it.

, Make sure that others in your home are on board, before you actually adopt. You may want to bring roommates, parents, children, spouses or partners with you to the shelter, so that they can be a part of this fun process. If you rent, be sure to contact your landlord about their policies. Aldo, if you already have a dog, bring them along to make sure that they are friendly with the new dog.Consider if anyone living with you is allergic to dogs.

, Once you have evaluated your resources and checked with the people in your life, you will want to think about what kind of dog you are looking for. Various breeds of dogs need different levels of care. For example, some dogs need more exercise and outdoor time than other breeds. Research the specifications of different breeds and determine a dog type that will work for you.Certain dogs, like pit bulls, may be prohibited in certain communities and may make it difficult to find homeowners insurance. If you are considering a pit bull, check with your shelter about any local laws before you buy your pet.
For example, a Basset Hound might be a bad choice if you intend for it to be your running partner.

, If you are new to owning a dog, you may want to try it out before you dive in. Consider dog-sitting for friends and family members or borrowing someone’s dog for a few days. This will give you a give idea of whether or not you are ready for the responsibilities of dog ownership.

Pack extra materials (recommended).,
Walk the dog before you leave.,
Take a look around.,
Introduce your dog to the beach.,
Decide whether to take off the leash.,
Stop your dog from drinking at the shore.,
Watch your dog at all times.",How to Take Your Dog to the Beach," Look up the rules of the beach before you confirm your plans. Many beaches do not allow dogs at all. Others only accept dogs on leashes, or have certain dog-friendly hours.;
, Only bring your dog to the beach if he gets along well with adults, children, and other dogs. If he doesn't have excellent recall (ability to come when called), it's best to keep the dog on a long leash for the entire beach visit.


If you have a cute dog, expect a lot of attention from other beach goers, especially children. Be prepared to chat and answer questions if you visit a crowded beach.

, Always bring these materials on any beach visit that includes your dog:


Plenty of fresh water and a container your dog can drink from, such as a collapsible rubber travel dish
Plastic bags to clean up after your dog
Leash, collar, and up-to-date tags
Old towels to dry the dog
Your dog's favorite toy and treats to help your dog obey commands and associate the beach with fun

, Your dog can easily overheat by exercising in hot weather. Bringing extra water will help, but you may also want an umbrella for shade. If you plan to spend more than a couple hours at the beach, you could pack extra-hydrating ""popsicles"" in a cooler. These are simply unsalted chicken broth frozen into ice cubes or popsicles.


If your dog has a thin coat or short hair, bring sunblock for dogs. The nose can get sunburned as well.

, There are a few more supplies that could come in handy in some circumstances:



Put together a first aid kit, especially if the beach has broken glass or other dangerous litter
Have an up-to-date photo of the dog to show people in case your dog runs away
Bring something to use as a stake if you can't trust your dog to stay on command.

, If you can, get your dog to do her business before you make the trip. You should still bring plastic bags just in case, but there's less chance of your dog bothering others with a mess.

, Before you bring your dog onto the beach, survey the area for other dogs, rowdy visitors, or anything else that might make your dog nervous. Also check the ground for broken glass as well as unattended or discarded food. Steer your dog to an area of the beach where these are less of a problem.


If you're not 100% sure about beach rules, find a sign and check the dog and leash laws.

, If your dog has never been to a beach before, keep her on the leash for now. Walk her over hard sand and let the water lap onto her feet. Keep your voice and body language happy and excited to help your dog relax and enjoy herself.


Don't force your dog into the water. Some dog breeds are natural swimmers, but not all of them — and individual dogs may prefer to stay on land.

, The excitement of the beach can make dogs disobedient. You must have total confidence in your dog's training before you let him off the leash, especially if there are crowds or dangerous areas. A long, retractable leash is the safer option.

, Dogs exploring a beach for the first time sometimes drink the water. Drinking saltwater can cause vomiting or diarrhea, and even freshwater may be too cold or dirty for your dog to drink safely.


Plenty of fresh water is the best way to prevent your dog from doing this, and the best treatment if your dog does slurp up the ocean.

, Always be aware of what your dog is doing, especially if you let him off the leash. Steer your dog away from small children, picnic blankets, and any possible dangers.


For the sake of your car on the way back, keep an eye out for dead fish or other gross objects your dog might roll in.

Scrape off visible dirt and debris.,
Soak hard and rubber dog toys in warm, soapy water.,
Rinse the dog toys under cold running water.Squeeze excess water out of the toys, particularly the squeaky or rubber toys.,
Sanitize dog toys by running them through the dishwasher.,
Clean frequently.",How to Wash Dog Toys1," Use a toothbrush to brush away any dirt, leaves, grass, or food particles. Getting the big pieces off is the first step before you try to disinfect the toy of any microbes or smaller bacteria., Fill the sink with hot water and add a squirt of liquid dish soap. Hold each toy under the running water and scrub it with a sponge or by hand. Be sure to wash away any food that may be stuck in stuff-able chew toys, and rub out grass stains, dirt stains and other noticeable imperfections.


You can also soak the dog toys in one part water and one part white vinegar if you are uncomfortable with the idea of your dog ingesting soap.It’s not a good idea to wash items like dog bones or pig ears that dogs eat.

, Lay them on a towel to air dry.

, Place the toys on the top rack of the dishwasher, and run the machine on a hot cycle, without any detergent.This method will use very hot water and strong water pressure to ensure the toys are sterilized. Allow soft and stuffed toys to air dry after the dishwasher cycle is complete.

, Washing dog toys frequently and keeping them germ-free is a good way to keep them in good shape. You don’t need to clean the toy every day or even every week, but a few times a month you should repeat this process. The dog toys will stay in better condition and your animal will be able to enjoy them for longer.

Start with a simple find trick.,
Lightly cover the toy or treat with dirt, sand, or snow.,
Pair behavior with treats.,
Introduce digging command.,
Bury treat or toy deeper.,
Start withholding the treat until the dog digs up the treat/toy.,
Practice Frequently.",How to Teach a Dog to Dig1," If your dog has a favorite toy or treat, place the treat or toy on the ground. Then tell your dog to find it. This is often more effective with more than one person, so one person can hold the dog while you place the treat. This will start getting your dog to associate finding with the toy or treat., This will encourage a dog who doesn’t already dig to do so. They will want to get to their treat. Using a favorite toy or treat will be especially helpful if the dog seems reluctant to dig. Remember certain breeds were bred to dig; others were not., Once you've taught your dog to dig, make sure you reward them. Praise them highly and give them a treat. If they’re obsessed with the treat they dug up, still praise them, so they know they did what you wanted., Once you’ve got them thinking digging is a good thing, introduce the command. “Dig” can be a good choice, especially if paired with gestures to keep it from getting confused with “sit.” Remember to be consistent you’re your choice of command and gestures., If you want the trick to get more advanced, take progressive steps toward it. Going too fast can confuse or bore a dog, as they will not know what you want. But if you increase the depth by increments you will get them excited to please you. Try not to increase the depth more than once in the same session., If you want the dog to dig up the treat or toy, you need to keep the reward until they accomplish the task. If the dog seems confused, you might need to work on shallower depths of the treat or toy, or with the basic task of finding the toy. Try different treats if one doesn’t work or has stopped working., Again, practice is the most important part of learning any trick. With a dog who doesn’t already dig, practice is even more important. The key is to practice frequently, but don’t make the sessions too long (keep it to 10-15 minutes)."

If you are renting, the shelter or rescue group may ask that you provide evidence that pets are welcome in your building.
The application may ask that you provide the contact information for your veterinarian.

, Talk to the shelter staff about the medical history of any prospective dogs. Determine if there are any medical issues you need to be aware of. Although the vast majority of shelters and rescue groups spay and neuter their animals, your dog may have a medical condition that prevents it. It is important that you ask in order to make sure you know your responsibilities after adoption.Ask questions like “when was the do last vaccinated?” and “does the dog have any chronic conditions?”

, Once you get an idea of the dog’s medical history, be sure to ask about other things like temperament and any previous owners. Although the staff may not have a lot of specific information about the dog before they received it, they may have an idea of what its situation was like before coming to the shelter. Because they work with the animals daily, they will also be able to fill you in on the temperaments of each dog. This will be valuable information to help you find the perfect dog.


Ask the staff questions like “can you tell me anything about the dog’s previous owner?” or “do you know where the dog was at before it came here?”
You can also ask questions like “which dog is the friendliest?” or “which dogs are the most energetic?”

, Many shelters will allow you to walk the dogs and play with them a little to get a feel for their personalities. Depending on what you are looking for, this is a good opportunity to check out the dog’s energy levels and temperament. This should give you a better idea if the dog is “the one.”


If you want an athletic dog that will go for runs and hikes with you, look for one that runs around a lot and seems eager to play.
Many shelters and rescue groups will have a play area with toys for you to spend some time with potential dogs.

, Once you have picked a dog, you may have to pay a fee and fill out some paperwork. The type of paperwork and size of the fee will differ from shelter to shelter. The paperwork will likely document your adoption and give details about your dog’s medical history. The fees are important because they help the shelter or rescue group meet their expenses and provide proper care for their animals. "

Transition your dog with care.,
Create a space for your dog.,
Stick to the type of food your dog was fed in the shelter.,
Develop a routine.,
Follow up with the shelter.",How to Adopt a Dog from a Humane Society or Animal Shelter3," When you bring your dog home for the first time, try to make the transition as easy as possible. If you are driving, do not drive erratically, blare loud music or yell at other drivers. Once you get home, try to keep things quiet and serene. Keep the volume low on your electronic devices and ask that your family or roommates try not to excite the dog too much. The dog will likely be a little anxious about entering a new space. A little peace will make that transition much easier. , Dog proof an area of your home and make sure that your dog’s food, water and bedding are located there. Because rescue and adopted dogs sometimes forget their housetraining when in a new place, you may want to consider a room where cleaning up messes will be easy.Dog proofing can include taping loose electrical cords to baseboards; storing household chemicals on high shelves; removing plants, rugs, and breakables; setting up a crate; and installing baby gates.

, Your new dog’s digestion, like that of most animals, is very sensitive to changes. They will have become accommodated to the food that they were fed in the shelter, and any quick changes in diet may make them sick. In order to keep your dog healthy, be sure to feed them the same food they were fed while in the shelter. After a few weeks, you can start mixing in other foods if you think that is necessary.Ask the shelter about your dog’s feeding schedule and try to stay on that schedule once you bring your dog home.
Be sure to consult your veterinarian before making any alterations to your dog’s diet.

, In the first few days that your dog is in your home, try to get it into a regular routine. Take it for walks at times that accommodate your schedule and that you will be able to stick to in the future. Initially, you will also want to stick to your animal’s eating schedule at the shelter. However, you might need to change that in order to accommodate your schedule. Find a system that works for you and your dog and stick to it.Be patient with you new dog.

, Once you and your new dog have settled into a routine, be sure to send photos of your pup to the staff that helped with your adoption. The shelter staff will certainly appreciate the effort. At shelters, they usually have a wall of pictures of adopted pets with their new owners. Shelters and rescue groups tend to use these pictures as a means of publicizing the shelter and attracting new adopters.

Clear off dirt and debris.,
Wash the toys in the washing machine.,
Microwave the soft and stuffed toys.,
Put dirty rope toys in the dishwasher.,
Clean frequently.,
Do not use bleach.",How to Wash Dog Toys2," Use a wire comb or a toothbrush to try to get rid of any dirt, food, and other crud on the dog toy. A wire comb is good for getting this type of debris out of dog toys that have fake fur on them.

, The washing machine is probably the best way to clean a soft dog toy. Check the tags on stuffed animals to ensure they can be put in the washing machine. Wash them on a gentle cycle with a mild detergent or no detergent at all. Once the washing machine has finished you can run the toys through the dryer on low heat for about 30 minutes. You also could allow them to air dry.


It’s okay to throw tennis balls in the wash.Keep in mind that new tennis balls actually aren’t good for dogs, so throw the ball in the dirt a few times before giving it back to your dog. That way the chemicals from the packaging won’t irritate their throat.

, Try to remove as much excess crud as possible before you put the toy in the microwave. The heat from the microwave will do the rest to kill the bacteria and germs on the toy. Make sure you start by soaking the toys in water, ringing them out, and then placing them in the microwave. Run the microwave for 1 minute, keeping an eye on the toys while they heat. Be careful removing toys from the microwave, as they might be hot.


Do not microwave a toy if it has any metal on it.
Microwaving is a great idea for rope toys.

, Although it isn't a good idea to put stuffed animal toys or anything with plastic inside of it in the dishwasher, rope toys are fine. If you don’t have a microwave and you want to clean a rope toy you can easily throw it in a dishwasher with no detergent., The more often you clean the toy the better condition it will stay in. If you want to use the toy for longer, take good care of it.

, You could kill your animal this way and it isn’t worth the risk. The ASPCA says that using watered down bleach on non-porous toys is alright, but you should just stick with another cleaning solution that won’t endanger your dog.

Mark out a specific place you’d like your dog to dig.,
Lightly bury toys or treats in the area.,
Reward dog only when they dig in that area.,
Be careful not to reward unwanted digging.",How to Teach a Dog to Dig2," Sometimes you can use a sandbox, or dig up some soil to make it loose for the dog. You can also mark places you don’t want the dog to dig with short fences or other physical deterrents. If your dog has an attractive place to dig, they will be less likely to dig where you don’t want them to., Bury their favorite toys or a treat in the area where you want them to dig. Don’t make it too deep or they may not notice it. This should entice them to dig there., With time, they will come to associate digging in that particular location with rewards. If they are clicker trained, this is an especially good time to use it, as you can click precisely when they’re digging in the area you want them to. Don’t forget to praise them when you give them the reward., Don’t reward the dog if they dig anywhere but the marked-out area. Be careful not to do anything that seems like you’re condoning them digging in another area. They will get confused, and dig elsewhere unwittingly. It is often easier to train a dog to entirely give up a behavior than to control where the dog does it, though not impossible. However, you must be consistent. Any change in your response will confuse the dog.

"
"
Catch your dog digging.,
Repeat rewards frequently.,
Pair the behavior with a command.,
Start withholding treats until dog digs.,
Practice the trick frequently.",How to Teach a Dog to Dig3," Catching a dog's behavior simply means rewarding a behavior that the dog already does precisely when you see it happen. If your dog already digs, and you want them to dig on command, reward them when you see them digging. You should try to catch them often, as they might only do the behavior sometimes. This will be easier than trying to teach the dog to dig if they do not dig already, or when they’re not digging.If your dog is clicker-trained, simply use the clicker to catch the behavior., If you catch the behavior multiple times and reward the dog, the dog will begin to associate digging with good things. This will help imprint the trick in the dog's mind., Once you’ve got your dog associating digging with treats, you can pair the behavior with a command such as “dig.” Say ""dig"" when your dog digs, and give them a treat. Remember to keep the command short, so your dog will have an easier time learning it. You might want to pair the command with a gesture such as making a digging motion with your hands. This will help the dog not to confuse similar sounding commands, such as “sit.”, Once you’ve associated the command with the action. You should hold back on the treat until the dog has performed the command. Don’t repeat the command over and over. Just say it once and wait for the dog to respond. If the dog doesn’t get it, don’t give the dog the treat. Instead go back over the trick, and work on ""catching"" the behavior., This is perhaps the most important part. Once your dog understands the trick, it’s important to practice it, especially in the beginning. After awhile it will stick with fewer practice sessions. It’s still a good idea to return to old tricks to make sure your dog remembers."

Play tug-of-war with your dog.,
Teach your dog to fetch.,
Play hide-and-seek with your dog.,
Look into dog agility groups.,
Teach your dog vocabulary.,
Play with your dog often.,
Learn the importance of toys.,
Purchase active toys for your dog.,
Buy your dog some distraction toys.,
Purchase soft toys for your dog.,
Try several options and rotate them.,
Do not use your old household items.,
Ensure any toy you buy is safe and size appropriate.",How to Play with Your Dog," Most dogs instinctually take to games of tug-of-war because it’s one of the ways puppies can play while both tugging on an object with their mouths. Choose a long, soft toy (such as a stuffed animal or a knotted rope) that you can grip away from your dog’s mouth and that your dog can’t wrench out of your hand with a head shake.Grip the toy with your hands at the ends, and associate a command such as “Get it!” with the game. Once the dog tug playfully without letting go for ten to twenty seconds before giving another commands such as “Drop it.”It will obviously take time to teach your dog the commands. Use positive reinforcement and treats to teach the commands. For instance, have a treat ready in one hand when you say, “Drop it.” Repeat the command but don’t provide the treat until your dog releases the tug toy.After several times, your dog will begin associating the phrase and obeying even without the treat.
Contrary to popular belief, it’s okay to let your dog win at tug sometimes. It’s an especially good tactic to help your dog develop confidence when it comes to play time, and it does not automatically make your dog think of itself as the pack leader.
Keep the tug toy at waist height or below so as not to encourage your dog to jump up on your or others.;
, While many sporting dogs were long bred for the purpose of fetching (think retrievers), almost all dogs still love to play fetch. You can use a standard active toy (such as a ball) or even something like a frisbee or disc that is made of a solid hard plastic or rubber. Get your dog’s attention with the object while it is still in your hand, ensure the dog’s eyes track it as you move it around, and then throw the toy. Call your dog back to you with the toy and use the same “Drop it” command you would for a game of tug-of-war before throwing it again.If your dog initially has trouble understanding that you want it to chase the object, then start teaching your dog fetch by playing a game of tug where you toss the tug object a foot or two away. Your dog will still grab it at this distance, and you can slowly increase the distance until it turns into fetch.While sticks are the stereotypical object with which to play fetch outside, they can actually cut your dog’s mouth or cause other injuries. Use dog-safe toys instead. You can even use soft, stuffed toys for indoor games of fetch.This is also a great source of exercise for dogs that doesn’t have to wear you out at the same time, and by changing up the direction, distance, and height at which your throw the toy, you can keep your dog engaged in the play for a long time., This game is great because it also encourages dogs to use their sense of smell. Take your dog’s favorite toy or a few treats and go hide in part of the house where the dog can’t see you. Then call your dog’s name once and wait for it to come find you. Excitedly give your dog praise when it finds you, and reward the dog with one of the treats or a brief game of tug with the toy you brought.Use the “Stay” command to stop your dog from following you as you hide. If your dog doesn’t yet know the “Stay” command, this is a great game to help teach it, or you can simply have someone else hold the dog still while you hide and let go as soon as you call for the dog.Choose very easy hiding spots as you teach your dog the game, and find progressively harder ones as the dog gets the hang of how to play. Once your dog is a pro, you will be able to hide completely out of sight, forcing the dog to use its sense of smell to locate you., If you have a high-energy dog that is eager to obey, investigate joining a dog agility group.You can find information on these groups at veterinary clinics, local pet stores, or through an internet search. An agility course has various objects and walks that the dog is taught to navigate. These include weave poles, teeter boards, tire jumps, elevated walks, and tunnels.


These fun gatherings test both the owner and dog’s ability to work as a team to navigate these objects and walks in a competition against other owners and dogs.

, One fun game is to teach your dog a vocabulary. As you hand over a toy, say the name. An example would be a ball. Say, “Ball,” and give the ball to the dog. Then have the dog give you the ball and repeat the process of naming and handing the ball to your dog. Then when the ball is on the floor, point at it and say, “Get your ball.” The dog will likely associate the word ‘ball’ with the actual ball and should go to it. This process can be repeated with almost any object as long as the word is one simple word., Now that you have some fun games and toys in mind, make sure you play with your dog often. You should aim to play with your dog twice a day for around fifteen minutes each time. You can also combine playtime with other exercise for your dog, such as walking over to the neighborhood park before playing and walking home.

, In addition to simply curbing your dog’s boredom, playing with toys can help eliminate other unwanted behaviors and provide comfort for your dog when left alone.The right toys are also useful ways to help teach your dog new commands and games.

, Active toys are the variety your dog is most likely to spend time with. These toys are typically made of very hard rubber or thick, knotted rope that your dog can carry around and chew on regularly without immediately destroying them.Some people use rawhide chew toys instead, but these can easily create choking hazards as your dog chews off smaller bits of the rawhide, so hard rubber toys can offer a safer option.Tennis balls are also a common active toy option. Keep your eye on your dog with tennis balls, though, and discard them as soon as your dog chews through it to prevent any choking hazards.Nylabone and Kong are two common brands of durable, active toys for dogs., Certain toys are especially meant to keep your dog engaged and enriched for hours when you can’t. These distraction-type toys are often puzzles with a treat inside that your dog can get to over time. Many of these options allow you to break up the treat and mix it with peanut butter (a dog’s favorite!) before inserting the mix into the toy. The dog then chews away on the toy, reaching small bits of treat and peanut butter over time.“Busy-box” toys are another popular option in this category. These hard rubber spheres and cubes allow you to place treats inside, which your dog can only reach by moving the toy around to make the treats fall out., Dogs also love stuffed toys in addition to harder ones. Soft toys usually end up in one of two categories—a comfort toy that your dog carries around constantly or a “kill” toy that your dog rambunctiously picks up and shakes around vigorously.Though not technically soft toys, bubbles also make great “kill” toys for dogs. Blow some bubbles, and if your dog likes them, it will pounce and bite at them playfully. Just make sure you purchase pet-safe bubble brands in case the dog manages to ingest some of the mix or if one of the bubbles bursts right next to your dog’s eyes.Soft toys with squeakers in them are very common “kill” toys since your dog will often shake it around trying to get the squeaking portion out of the toy.Ensure that you keep a close on your dog around these toys and throw away the squeakers and loose stuffing to prevent choking hazards., As with any toys, you may have to try several options of each before you find something your dog loves. Your dog may not react at all to tennis balls but will play for hours with a rope toy, for instance. Find four or five toys that your dog loves, and rotate them out, giving the dog one or two of them each week.This helps prevent your dog from getting bored with the toy selection.


Try to keep at least one toy to roll, one to comfort, one to “kill,” and one to carry/chew in the rotation.Dogs often have a very favorite in the “comfort” toy category—one that your dog babies. This is often a mainstay in the toy rotation that you can leave with your dog all the time., Household objects such as old shoes, bungee cords, or belts are not suitable toys. A dog can't tell the difference between your old shoe and the one you bought yesterday. Also, your dog can tear most household objects into small pieces and eat them. They will eat things you would never have thought possible.

, Remove items such as string, ribbons, or any other potential choking hazards from any toys you give your dog.You should also pick options that are size appropriate for your dog. A large dog can potentially swallow a ball meant for a toy breed, and conversely, a toy meant for a sporting breed can be too big or heavy to engage a smaller dog.If a piece of toy or another foreign object is swallowed, it can lodge in your dog’s stomach or intestines, leading to expensive vet bills and even surgery. Warnings sign that your dog may have swallowed something include:Vomiting or retching
Lethargy
Loss of appetite
Abdominal pain or discomfort

Figure out how much your dog can exercise.,
Let your dog walk you.,
Take your dog for a run.,
Go hiking with your dog.,
Take your dog to the beach.,
Let your dog track something.",How to Spend the Perfect Day with Your Dog1," A perfect day for your dog should probably contain some form of exercise. However, the day may not be so perfect if your dog can’t keep up with you or ends up injuring himself from playing too hard. Take your dog to your veterinarian to discuss how much your dog can safely exercise. Scheduling this appointment with your veterinarian is especially important if your dog has not been exercising regularly.How much your dog can exercise would depend on his age, energy level, and overall health status.;
, Any other day, you would control the direction and pace of the walk. On a perfect day, switch this around—let your dog tell you where to go.This does not mean he can forget his leash manners for a day—you are simply letting him to use his nose to guide the walk.


You may be pleasantly surprised with where you end up when you let your dog choose the direction.
Make sure your dog is properly leash trained.

, If you have an active dog, part of your perfect day could involve taking him out for an invigorating run. A good run increases your dog’s stamina and strengthens his muscles.The run is also a good way for him to release pent-up energy.


For a perfect day, remember that the run is for your dog, not for you.If he wants to stop and smell some flowers or investigate something along the running path, let him do so.

, If you enjoy outdoor exercise, then consider going hiking with your dog. A hike would allow him to explore the outdoors and experience new things in his environment.Be sure to pack plenty of water, poop bags, and a first-aid kit for your dog when you go hiking.Antibiotic ointment and gauze are especially important in case your dog cuts or scrapes the bottom of his paws.
If you live in an area with ticks, check your dog for ticks after the hike. Remove the ticks if you see them.
Be aware that many state parks, but not national parks, allow dogs on trails.The website http://www.hikewithyourdog.com/ is a good resource for identifying parks in your area that allow dogs on their trails.
Going backpacking with your dog is another great way to spend a day outdoors with your dog., If you live near a dog-friendly beach and the weather is nice, then a day at the beach with your dog would be perfect. On a warm summer day, your dog would love to run in the sand, play in the water, and generally enjoy the warmth of the day.Before you hop in the car and head to the beach with your dog, remember a few things to keep him safe.


Being out in the heat and sun at the beach can be exhausting for your dog. Create a shaded area for him and give him plenty of water to keep him cool and well hydrated. Dogs with short hair, white hair, or pink skin can easily be sunburned. Put pet-safe sunblock on your dog’s nose and ear tips before heading to the beach.Check the water conditions before your dog jumps in the water.If the water is unsafe for humans to swim in, then your dog should not swim in it either.
If your dog doesn’t swim well, play fetch with him or take him for a run or walk along the water line. Your dog can injure himself running in the sand,so you may want to take him on a leisurely stroll instead.
Put a dog-specific life jacket on your dog if he is going to be swimming in the water.Do not let your dog drink the ocean water or eat the sand. Both the water and sand could cause digestive upset.Bring a poop bag to clean up after your dog.Give your dog a good bath when you get back home, especially if he has played in the water. The water has salt and minerals that could irritate your dog’s skin., Dogs naturally use their noses to locate items in their environment.During a perfect day with your dog, let him put his ‘nose’ skills to the test with a tracking game. This can be done in the comfort of your own home or outside in a large open area.


Think of tracking as playing a fun game of hide and seek with your dog.
Hiding his toy when he cannot see you hide it will allow him to use his nose to locate it.If you are outside, hide the toy and stand downwind (wind is in your face) of it with your dog. The wind will carry the toy’s scent to your dog’s nose, once again testing his ‘nose’ skills to find the toy."

But toys should never be so small that they can easily be swallowed or become lodged in your dog’s throat.Similarly, keep out of reach household products that are thin and easily consumed. These include ribbon, rubber bands, and string.
Because dogs vary so much in size, it is difficult to say what a safe size is. It is important, however, that the dog not be able to swallow it. Thus, it should be large enough that you couldn't imagine your dog getting it down its throat.;
, Plastic toys can be safe. Some toys, however, include dangerous chemicals. Often labels will not include a comprehensive list of ingredients, but they will advertise if they are free of dangerous chemicals.


Look for labels that indicate toys are “phthalate free” and “BPA free.”You can also use your senses to assess the risk associated with plastic toys. Be careful if the toy has a strong chemical smell. Bright colors are also sometimes created with dangerous dyes.
To follow up, research the product online. Good manufactures ought to include information on their website about the manufacturing process and toy safety., Squeak toys are a favorite of dogs and are not necessarily dangerous. However, your dog may feel that he must find and destroy the source of the squeaking. In the process, he could ingest the toy or the squeaker.


Squeak toys are not dangerous on their own, your dog might just be unusually aggressive with them. Just watch them carefully to ensure that your dog does not seem to be tearing out the insides or trying to eat parts of the toy.

, Any soft toy can be torn up. However, you should try to purchase toys that are durable to prevent your dog from getting to the dangerous innards of the toy. Look for toys that are labeled as machine washable., Rawhide might seem like the natural choice, but it is often treated with dangerous chemicals. When chewed up, it can also become small and easy to swallow. This poses a particularly significant risk to your dog.Many rawhides also come from an international fur trade that is morally questionable.If you do give your dogs rawhide watch carefully when your dog is chewing on rawhide. Make sure that the piece has not gotten so small that your dog could swallow it. Be careful if your dog is pulling off small pits that could be swallowed. Take away any small bits of rawhide that could be swallowed.Give your dog rawhide only if it is not around other dogs. Around other dogs, they can get competitive and will begin eating the rawhide more quickly. If they are calmly consuming the rawhide, there is less risk of injury.

, Dogs can break their teeth on rib bones, cow hooves, and pig bones. Pig ears and bone marrow are less dangerous but can cause issues with digestion. Dental bones are a safer alternative.Bones from cooked foods are particularly dangerous. They can break teeth, scratch tongues, and cause damage throughout the digestive system.
Raw, uncooked bones can be safe.
Leg bones and bones that have been cut are also likely to break, causing damage.
If you do feed your dog bones, watch it carefully to make sure that it has not broken off any small pieces that could be swallowed.
Do not give bones to dogs that have had dental work.
Do not give bones to dogs when there are other dogs in the vicinity. They will compete for the bone and can hurt themselves when playing with it., Tennis balls are a great active toy for your dog. Your dog should not be at any risk of swallowing a tennis ball, unless he has been able to chew much of it up. Be mindful of any damage to the ball and replace frequently., Rope toys are also a good active toy. You can play a good game of tug of war with a rope. Your dog might particularly appreciate a bone shaped piece of rope., They are toys that are filled with treats or a combination of broken treats and peanut butter. They are less active toys, but they will occupy your dog for a long time. Your dog will have to work, possibly for hours, to get the treats out from inside the toy. This makes for a good, lazy day activity., Soft toys are comforting to dogs. Some dogs like to carry them around, so make sure that the toy is small enough for that purpose. Other dogs like to try to kill soft toys, so make sure the toy is large enough that it can not be ingested by your dog.Buy stuffed toys that are labeled safe for children. These should not contain especially dangerous fillings. Some fillings like nutshells and polystyrene beads are particularly unsafe, but no filling is truly safe to eat.You should monitor your dog with soft toys to make sure that they have not penetrated the exterior and reached the innards. These are unsafe to eat.
If a soft toy has serious scratches and tears, throw it away before your dog reaches the innards.
Your dog will be particularly comforted by soft, personal items. Shirts, pillow cases, and towels can carry your smell and thus will make your dog feel at home. Be prepared, however, to have these items torn up by your dog.

, To make sure that your dog doesn’t get tired of its toys, try to rotate them in and out of circulation once a week. Keep a few toys out and put the rest away somewhere your dog can’t reach them.


If, however, your dog has one favorite toy, you can consider leaving it out all the time. This is particularly the case with a soft toy that your dog has become emotionally attached to., When you put new toys out, don’t just leave them in the middle of the room. Put them behind couches and under tables. Your dog will appreciate toys that it needed to work to find. Your dog will also expend a lot of energy running around trying to find its toys., Keep out toys that serve different functions. For example, keep one that is used for fetching, one that is carried, one that is babied, one that is rolled, and one that is killed. Periodically put out a toy with treats inside., You can make your toys more attractive to your dog by introducing edible treats. To make a toy smell better, marinate it in bouillon. You can also spread peanut butter on toys, or put frozen Kool-Aid inside., Toys shouldn’t just be a way for dogs to occupy themselves, they should be an opportunity for you to bond with them. Playing with your dogs is a good way to socialize them. Playing fetch in a confined environment can make your home feel bigger than it is, because your dog will be able to run back and forth for great distances in a small space. This will make your wild friend feel comfortable inside."

Make sure your dog is healthy.,
Let your dog have his own fun.,
Watch how your dog behaves.",How to Spend the Perfect Day with Your Dog2," What dog wouldn’t love to spend time running around at a dog park? The fresh air, the exercise, and the chance to play with other dogs probably sounds perfect to your dog. Before heading to the park, make sure your dog is healthy and up-to-date with his vaccinations.


Making sure he’s healthy makes it less likely that he will become sick from playing with another dog or eating another dog’s poop.
Contact your veterinarian if you are unsure if your dog is up to date with his vaccinations.

, Dog parks have many benefits for both you and your dog. For example, your dog gets to meet new dogs and have fun with old friends, and you have the chance to meet and socialize with other dog owners.Fortunately, there is more than one way for your dog to have fun at a dog park.


Rather than playing with other dogs, your dog may prefer to explore the environment by sniffing the bushes or navigating through the trees.
If your dog is older and less active, he may want to just enjoy the view rather than play.
Let your dog have different types of fun at the park, as long as he is behaving appropriately with other dogs and people.

, More likely than not, your dog will enjoy his time at the dog park. However, you should observe him closely for signs that he may not be having fun, or is being overly rough with other dogs. If he is feeling playful, he’ll play-bow (hind end in the air), twist or jump in the air, and have an open and relaxed mouth.


Watch your dog for signs of fear (e.g., tucked tail, tensed muscles) and/or stress (e.g., whining or whimpering, hiding behind objects or people). Leave the dog park if your dog is clearly not having fun.
If your dog is being aggressive towards other dogs (e.g., pinning, excessive mounting, snarling, showing teeth), interrupt the play and separate him from the other dogs.

Have a household meeting.,

Block out the dog walking times on a calendar.,
Write out the duration of each walk.,
Assign each time to a household member.,
Post the schedule in a spot where everyone can see it.,
Set alarms and reminders.,
Adjust the schedule as needed.",How to Set a Household Dog Walking Schedule," Start by having a meeting with the members of your household. Arrange a time where you can all sit down and discuss the dog walking schedule as a group. You may direct the meeting so it runs smoothly and everyone participates in the discussion around the schedule. This way, everyone pays attention and agrees to the schedule.


For example, you may open the meeting by saying, “We are here to discuss the dog walking schedule. Having a schedule will ensure the dog gets enough exercise every day and everyone participates in taking care of the dog.”;
, Ask each household member to bring a copy of their daily schedule. They may present a physical copy or look at their weekly schedule on their cellphone. Make sure they have a copy of their schedule by week, with any important dates or events noted by date. They should also note any regular commitments or events in their calendar so it is clear they will not be available during that time and that day.


Spread the schedules out so you can compare them, noting which times are blocked off for each member of the household.
For example, you may have one household member who always has soccer practice on Mondays and Wednesday nights from 4-6 pm. Or you may have one household member who has a morning meeting every day for one week in March.

, Once you have compared the schedules of everyone in the household, you can start to figure out which walking times will work for each member of the household. Try to make the walking times equal among everyone in the household, if possible. The adults in the household may take more walking times if they have a less busy schedule than the kids in the household.For example, one household member may agree to take the early morning walking times as they tend to be busy in the evenings. Another household member may opt for taking the mid-afternoon walking times because they will be home and available at this time.

, Get a calendar that runs several months ahead so you can block out time on each day of the week for dog walking. You can also create your own calendar using computer software like Microsoft Word or Excel. Or you may write out a schedule on a large whiteboard that you can then erase and adjust as needed.For example, you may start the day with a 7 am walk time. An early morning walk is important for dogs, as they often need to go to the bathroom early in the morning.
The next walk may then be at 8 am, after the dog has eaten. This will ensure the dog has time to go to the bathroom and gets a little exercise before you go to work or school.
The next walk may be at 12 pm or 1 pm. This is a good time for the dog to have a longer walk and some playtime.
The next walk may then be between 5 and 7 pm. You may plan the evening walk for after your dinner time and your dog’s dinner time. This walk should be the longest walk your dog gets, where they have enough play time and exercise to burn off any excess energy.
The final walk of the day may be before your bedtime, between 10 and 12 pm. This may be a short walk to wear out your dog before bed and give them time to go the bathroom one last time.

, Once you have written out the specific walk times on the schedule, you should note how long each walk will be. This will help household members get a sense of the time commitment required for each walk. This will also ensure your dog gets enough exercise throughout the day.


Consider how much exercise your dog needs and make sure it is covered in the schedule. For example, you may have a Border Collie who needs at least two hours of physical activity a day. You may then make sure there is two hours of walking and playtime in the dog’s schedule.
For example, for the 7 am walk, you may write down, “10-15 minutes.” For the 8 am walk, write down “10-15 minutes.” For the 1 pm walk, you may write down, “30 minutes.” For the 5-7 pm walk, you may write down, “1 hour,” noting that this will be the longest walk time of the day.

, Once you have the walking times scheduled out, assign each time to a member of the household. Try to keep the times equal among members so one person does not get stuck with more walking time than others. You will also need to consider each household member’s schedule to ensure they have the time to walk to dog when needed.For example, you may write down next to the 7 am and 8 am walk times: “Mom.” You may then write down “Dad” next to the 1 pm walk time and “Mark and Sara” next to the 5-7 pm walk time. Then, you may write down “Dad” next to the 10 pm walk time.

, Once you have decided on the schedule, make sure it is posted somewhere central in your home. You may put it up in the kitchen or the living room where everyone in the household has access to it. Or you may post it by the front door so everyone can glance at it when they come and go.


Let everyone in the household know where the schedule is located so they have access to it at all times. This way, they cannot miss a scheduled walk time because they cannot find the schedule.

, To make sure you do not miss a walk time, or others do not miss their assigned time, set an alarm or a reminder on your phone. Set an alarm for early in the morning so you do not miss the 7 am walk on the dog walking schedule. Put a reminder in your phone for the after dinner walk so your dog gets some exercise after they eat.You should also encourage the other members of your household to set alarms and reminders so they do not miss their assigned walk times.

, Though you may have a solid schedule in place, you should also be flexible and adjust the schedule as needed. Everyone’s schedule may not stay the same after a few months so you may need to all revisit the dog walking schedule and adjust it to reflect these changes. You may hold another household meeting so you can discuss changes to the schedule and all agree to abide by the new schedule.You should also discuss if any existing walk times are too difficult for members of the household. You may need to reassign certain walk times so everyone can fulfill their commitments and help to ensure the dog gets enough exercise every day.

Blow bubbles at your dog.",How to Spend the Perfect Day with Your Dog3," What better way to spend a perfect day with your dog than to play with him to his heart’s content? Dogs are social animals,and can have that much more fun when playing with their owners. Playing fetch is a great way to interact and play with your dog.


Depending on your dog’s energy level, you could play fetch for long stretches of time.
If you are playing fetch outside, play with one of his favorite toys rather than a tree branch. The branch could potentially damage the inside of your dog’s mouth., Playing Frisbee is similar to playing fetch, but the Frisbee stays in the air for longer, allowing your dog to jump up and catch it in midair.Visit your local pet store to find a dog-specific Frisbee. A dog Frisbee will have softer layers that are easier for a dog to grip.Frisbee is a great game to play for dogs who love to run and jump.
Check with your veterinarian to see if your dog can handle all of the jumping required to play Frisbee., Running and playing can make for a perfect day, but so can learning new tricks. Your dog can probably follow the basic commands with ease, but as he gets older, he’ll need to learn some more tricks to keep his mind sharp. During your perfect day with him, give him a new and fun trick to learn, such as playing dead, rolling over, or grabbing paw.


Your dog may not master the trick in a day, but he would at least have fun starting to learn it.
Teaching your dog new tricks is a good way to interact with him.
By challenging him with new tricks, you will prevent a decrease in his cognitive skills., Think outside the box to come up with different ways to play with your dog. One interesting activity is blowing bubbles. Chasing bubbles mimics your dog’s natural predatory behavior and can keep him easily entertained.You will probably be entertained watching your dog chase after something he can’t really catch.
Make sure the bubbles are pet-safe."

Your dog may be bored simply because it is tired of playing with the same old toys and it needs to be able to focus on something new. Get your dog some new toys and see if that perks the pup right up.Dog toys come in an astounding array of types, from stuffed animals to ropes and balls. If your dog isn't responding to a certain type of toy, try a different one.;
, To stimulate your dog's mind, you can make it do some work to get its meals. One way you can do this is by using a puzzle feeder. A puzzle feeder stimulates the dog's mind by making the dog figure out how to get its food out through a puzzle.Another way you can make feeding time more stimulating is by hiding your dog's food and making it find it. This is a good challenge for dogs that enjoy chasing scents.

, Depending on what type of dog you have, your dog may be bored because it is not using its natural skills. For instance, a dog that is a herding breed, such as a border collie, needs a job in order to be happy.If you have this type of dog, consider teaching it a skill or game that utilizes its natural attributes.


In the case of border collies, they can become very good at agility work. Teach your dog to jump over obstacles or to complete an agility course. This will give it something to focus its mind on.

, If you are unsure how to teach your dog a new skill then you can take it to a class where a professional can teach you and your dog a new skill. This could be an obedience class or a class that teaches your dog how to do an activity, such as agility work. This can be a great way for your dog to learn new skills, be stimulated, and avoid boredom.


To find a class near you consult with your local humane society or your veterinarian. These professionals can help you find a class and assess what type of classes and teacher might be right for your dog.You can also ask family and friends for suggestions of where to go or you can do an online search for a class nearby.

, If your dog never gets to go on walks, then you need to start taking it on daily walks. However, perhaps you do take it on walks but you always go on the same route. Your dog may be bored of going on that same route every day. In order to eliminate this boredom, try taking the dog somewhere new.A new route for your dog's daily walks can provide a wide array of new sights and smells for your dog to enjoy and investigate.
For an even more exciting change of pace, try taking your dog to a dog park at least once a week. If your dog loves interacting with other dogs, then this will be a special treat that will engage your dog's mind and body.

, The easiest way to relieve your dog's boredom is to do more with it. Take it with you when you can, take it for walks every day, and do activities with it, such as playing catch, that it enjoys. If you take the time to interact with your dog regularly, that can go a long way towards ending its boredom.If you have been neglecting doing activities with your dog and you want to increase them, put specific times in your calendar that you will spend with your dog. If you make a set appointment to spend time with it, then you are more likely to do it.

, If your dog is having a hard time being alone, then it might benefit from having a friend around when you are gone. If your dog doesn't get along with other dogs then this may not be the solution but if your dog is relatively friendly and enjoys other dogs, then its boredom may be relieved by having a new friend around all the time.


Getting a second dog is not a decision to take lightly. If your old dog doesn't get along with the new dog then you are still responsible for caring for that new dog.
Consider taking your old dog to meet some prospective new dogs before you commit to any adoption to see if it gets along with any of them. Also, after adopting another dog, make sure to introduce the dogs gradually, so that they get off to the right start.

, If you have to be gone a lot and your dog is bored, then you should consider taking it somewhere during the day where it can have fun and get mental stimulation. Taking it to a doggy daycare will allow it to interact with humans and other dogs throughout the day, while if it was at home it would be all by itself.


A doggy daycare is a good choice for a dog that loves interacting with other dogs and humans. If your dog doesn't like other people or dogs, then this may not be the best choice for your specific pet., If you don't want to take your dog to a doggy daycare then another option is hiring a dog walker. Perhaps you don't have time in the morning to drop your dog off at a doggy daycare or your dog doesn't like other dogs. If this is the case, a dog walker can come to your home, pick up your dog, and take it for a walk.


Different dog walkers structure their walks differently. Some take individual dogs for walks in their own neighborhoods. Others take groups of dogs for walks together. Before hiring a dog walker, discuss the system that they use to walk the dog and be sure that is what you want for your dog.

, One way to tell if your dog is bored is if it starts destroying its surroundings. A dog that chews up your favorite shoes or digs numerous holes in the yard is, in most cases, simply trying to amuse itself.Destruction that is rooted in boredom can come in a variety of forms. It could be chewing any type of item, digging, or even relieving itself inside the house.

, Excessive barking can be more common in some breeds but it can also be the sign that your dog is bored. A bored dog that is left alone a lot may bark due to unhappiness and loneliness.If your dog has not always barked a lot but has begun barking excessively when you are not around, there is a good chance that it is bored and that it needs more mental stimulation and activity.

, A young dog that is lying around all day is not getting enough mental stimulation and fun to stop it from becoming bored. While older dogs may need a lot of sleep, young dogs don't and they should so activities throughout the day.


However, lethargy can be a sign that your dog is ill. If your dog is less active than normal and hesitant to dog activities it normally loves, then it should be checked out by a veterinarian.If all your dog does is sleep, then you need to work on giving it some activities.

Throw out worn and broken toys.",How to Rotate Your Dog's Toys," Your dog can only be interested in a limited number of toys at a time. Four or five is a good number because it's enough to keep your dog interested without overwhelming it with a large number of toys., To keep your dog interested, change out the toys your dog plays with about once a week. Pick up this week's toys, and put them away. In exchange, get four to five more toys out for your dog to play with. That means you need at least eight to ten toys for your dog to play with., As you change out the toys, clean the toys as needed. For rubber toys, you can scrub them hard with hot soap and water or stick them in the dishwasher (but skip the soap in the dishwasher). For rope toys, clean them off, then stick them in the microwave (while still wet). Microwave for one minute, and then (carefully!) remove it. Stuffed toys can be run through the washing machine., Have different types of toys out for your dog to play with, rather than all the same variety. For instance, you could have hard rubber toys, food puzzle toys, tennis balls, rope toys (made for dogs), and stuffed toys. That way, your dog will have something to play with no matter what mood it's in., When you bring toys out, consider hiding them around the house in places your dog is likely to find them. If your dog can hunt down its toy, it will get more joy out of playing with the toy. Just don't hide them in a place where your dog has to destroy something to get to the toy., While you do want to rotate out toys to keep your dog interested, you should leave your dog's favorite toy out most of the time.

Make sure to watch how your dog interacts with stuffed toys before leaving it alone with one., If you have a large dog, you need large toys. Toys meant for smaller dogs could easily be swallowed by a larger dog. Similarly, larger toys could pose a risk for smaller dogs if they can't get their mouth around it easily., If you find your dog loves to play with something that's not made for dogs, make sure the toy is safe for your dog. Basically, you need to remove anything that your dog could swallow, such as ribbons, threads, and buttons or eyes.Also, look for the label ""child-safe."" If a stuffed toy is safe for children under three, then it's likely safe for dogs, as well. Stuffed toys that are safe for this age don't have dangerous fillers. Plus, these types of toys generally don't have buttons or other items that can come off, since those are choking hazards., Worn toys can come apart, and then the pieces can be ingested by your dog. As you put toys away, make sure to check them over for wear and tear. Discard any toys that are coming apart to keep your dog safe."

Know what to look for.,
Discipline your puppy.,
Take your dog to a puppy kindergarten or school.",How to Get Through Puppy Adolescence1," The age at which your puppy reaches adolescence depends on its breed. Generally, your puppy will enter adolescence when it’s between six and 18 months old. Moreover, you’ll probably notice a change in your dog’s behavior. Your puppy might become moody, disobedient, unpredictable, or just a “brat” in general. Knowing what you’re in for can help you be prepared for this new stage in your puppy’s development.Your dog might jump on you or your guests, or howl and nip at strangers or other pets.
Your dog might also begin to mark its territory by voiding in the house again.
Since your dog becomes sexually mature during adolescence, it might start humping other dogs or people’s legs.
On the other hand, some dogs display few or no signs of puppy adolescence.
Remember, puppy adolescence is just one stage on the way to doggie adulthood. Be patient – it will not last forever.;
, During adolescence, your dog might become wild and misbehave often. Maintain your dog’s ability to obey commands like sit, come, lie down, roll over by retraining in these or related skills. Be sure to give your dog a treat four out of every five times when it successfully obeys a command.By regularly going over discipline, the tricks and ability to listen will stay fresh in your dog’s mind throughout adolescence.
Depending on your dog, you might be able to get away with discipline training sessions once every three days or every other day.
For dogs that are having a hard time obeying, though, you should try to incorporate some level of training into your dog’s routine on a daily basis.

, Behavioral schools or training schools are institutions staffed with pet professionals who can adjust your dog’s behavior, if necessary. After attending the puppy kindergarten, your dog will engage more often in good behavior and will be more responsive to your commands. Depending on the type of training you request, your dog might also learn to improve its behavior around other dogs, strangers, and learn new tricks.Your puppy kindergarten trainers can also give you tips on how to better handle your dog when it’s misbehaving.
If you have specific issues with your adolescent puppy – for instance, growling at other pets or people, chewing on furniture, or urinating where it’s not supposed to – mention them to your puppy kindergarten teacher so they can take action to correct these problems.
You can find a good puppy school by asking for a recommendation from a fellow dog owner or vet. You could also consult your yellow pages or search online using a word string like “puppy kindergarten .”

Take note of which toys your small dog prefers.,
Interact with your dog when he is playing.",How to Make a Fun Toy for Your Small Dog," One benefit of making your own dog toys is that you can control how safe they are. Whichever toys you choose to make, do not include any potentially dangerous items (ribbons, string, rubber bands, small plastic pieces) in the toy's design.If swallowed, these items could cause serious digestive problems for your dog that could require veterinary care.
Your dog could also choke on these items.;
, Small dogs love to play with stuffed animals. One way to make a stuffed animal is to place stuffing from an old stuffed animal in an old sock, and sew up the end of the sock.If you do not have an old stuffed animal, you could stuff an old sock with other old socks.If you are good at sewing, you could purchase fabric at your local fabric store (or use fabric that you already have at home) and stitch together your own stuffed animal.
When making the stuffed animal, do not include any small pieces (e.g., buttons, plastic eyes, plastic nose, detachable pieces) that your small dog could swallow.Keep a close eye on your dog if you place a squeaker in your homemade stuffed animal. If your dog finds the squeaker, he could accidentally swallow it., This is another good toy for a small dog. To make this toy, you will need an old sock, an empty plastic water bottle without the cap, and some tasty treats. Fill the water bottle with treats, and then tuck the bottle inside the sock. Tie the top of the sock in a secure knot.Because of your dog’s small size, consider using an eight ounce water bottle.
You could also cut off the top of the water bottle to create a wider opening for your dog to access the treats. If you do this, make sure the bottle’s edges are smooth before placing the bottle in the sock.
Periodically replace the treats so they don’t get stale., If your dog enjoys playing tug of war with you, then a braided tug toy would be a great homemade toy him. To make this toy, you can use either old socks, old towels, or an old fleece blanket. Cut the towel, blanket, or socks into strips and braid the strips together.Make a secure knot at each end to prevent the braid from unraveling.

, This is a very simple toy to make at home, and can keep your small dog easily entertained. Because tennis balls would be too large for your small dog, fill the sock with ping pong balls. Make a secure knot at the open of the sock.Depending on how much your small dog likes to chew on things, he could chew on the sock enough to crack the ping pong balls inside.
Consider going to your local pet store to find small balls with which you could fill the sock.
You could also place treats inside a sock to make a homemade puzzle feeder toy., A denim dog toy is durable, which is good if your dog likes to chew and tear things apart. To make this toy, make a complete horizontal cut across one leg of a pair of old jeans.How high up the leg you make the cut is up to you.


After making the horizontal cut, make a vertical cut along the seam to lay the section out flat.Fold, not roll, the jeans section lengthwise.Create a loop with the folded jeans section, and then make a secure knot.The knot should be in the middle.

, You can use an old fleece blanket to make this toy. If you do not have fleece at home, you can purchase some at your local crafts store. Cut the fleece into strips—the length and width are up to you.Although there is not a specific number of strips to cut, a greater number of strips will make the toy thicker and puffier.


Stand the strips up on their side and line them up in a row.Run a long piece of heavy string (also available at your local crafts store) diagonally across and fully around the strips. Make a knot in the center of the strips.Repeat the same motion to create multiple knots in the center of the strips.Trim the excess string and fluff the strips.This toy is good if your small dog does not have a strong chewing tendency.

, Your small dog will need a variety of toys to prevent him from getting bored.Give him two to three toys at a time, then switch them out once a week.If you do not have enough homemade toys to rotate out this frequently, consider adding in some store-bought toys.


If your small dog tends to destroy his toys, you may need to rotate them out more frequently.

, Although dogs are generally not picky when it comes to toys,do not be surprised if your small dog prefers some toys over others. For example, he may really enjoy playing with the homemade stuffed animal, but not show much interest in the tug toy.


If you see him gravitating towards certain homemade toys, make more toys of that type.
Watching your dog will allow you to observe if (or when) your dog becomes destructive with his toys., Your small dog will love playing with his toys, but his playtime will be even more enjoyable if you are playing with him—interactive play is very important for your dog.Your homemade tug toy is great for engaging in a friendly tug-of-war game with your dog.

If you notice your dog engaging in antisocial and aggressive behavior like growling at other dogs, lowering its head and splaying its feet, or bristling the hair along its back, remove your dog from the situations for a brief time-out.
Host a puppy party where your friends and neighbors can bring their own dogs over to meet each other in a safe, controlled environment., Adolescent dogs are bundles of energy. In addition to time in the backyard or at the dog park, ensure your dog gets the opportunity to run around the backyard on its own outside of structured socialization opportunities. This will ensure your dog’s energy is spent in a constructive way, rather than a destructive way.Take your adolescent dog for a daily walk. A walk of 15-30 minutes each day will do wonders to keep your pup healthy and fit.The amount of exercise your dog needs depends on its weight. Larger dogs will need more exercise than smaller dogs.

, If you live in a family or have housemates, encourage them to help you. They can help you train and discipline your dog, walk it, and provide opportunities for socialization and play. The more people you have helping you out, the easier it will be to survive your pup’s adolescence.Simply ask your family or housemates, “Could you help me get my puppy through adolescence? If you have time to walk my puppy, play with it, or provide opportunities for socialization, I would be most grateful.”
If you have younger kids at home, ensure they treat your adolescent dog with respect. Remind them not to pull the dog’s tail or ears. Tell them not to scare the dog or yell at it.
For instance, tell your children, “Do not pull the dog’s tail or ears, and do not scare the dog or yell at it.”

, If your dog feels loved, it will strengthen the bond between you and prevent the likelihood that your dog will act out. Give your dog hugs and pat them gently on the head and back. Many dogs love being rubbed on their bellies. Offer verbal praise in the form of enthusiastic phrases like, “I love you, doggie” and “Good dog!”Smile at your dog when offering verbal praise.
Be sure not to let your love spill over into spoiling your dog. Loving your dog doesn’t mean you don’t punish it, but rather than you offer discipline in a loving way.
Never strike or shout at your dog when correcting its behavior.
Don’t nurse a grudge against your dog if it chewed your magazine, for instance. Correct its behavior and then let the issue go.
Avoid giving your dog too many treats. If your dog eats too many doggie treats, it might not be able to eat a more nutritious meal later.

, To get through puppy adolescence, your dog will need to be kept busy and have a range of experiences. For instance, intersperse disciplinary training sessions with walks, playtime, socialization, and other daily activities that your dog enjoys.Work with your dog to cater to their likes and wants. For instance, if your dog really enjoys watching TV with you, schedule time to watch TV together.

, When you’re out at school or work all day, your adolescent puppy is bored and lonely at home. Many adolescent puppies amuse themselves by eating newspaper or chewing on table or chair legs. In order to prevent these unwelcome outcomes, you should provide plenty of stimulation for your dog to enjoy while you’re away.Many dogs enjoy watching TV while their humans are away. Documentaries about other animals are generally favored.
Provide an array of balls, toys, and bones for your dog. This will dissuade your dog from chewing the sofa cushions and pillows.
Invest in a few KONG toys and leave one for your dog to play with each day. A KONG toy is a kind of hollow dog toy stuffed with bits of kibble or other doggie treats. The tasty bits are released throughout the day as your dog shakes and turns the toy around in the course of playing with it.

Spay or neuter your dog.,
Remind your dog to eliminate in the right place.,
Determine if your dog has a personality problem.,
Give your dog regularity.,
Use pheromone collars.,
Take your puppy to the vet.",How to Get Through Puppy Adolescence3," Spaying refers to the medical procedure in which a female dog’s uterus and ovaries are removed. In male dogs, neutering is the process by which the testes are removed. Both spaying and neutering are safe and common medical procedures. Spaying/neutering can reduce hormonal swings that cause changes in your dog’s mood and attitude.After being spayed/neutered, your dog won’t be able to reproduce, which will reduce the burden on you to care for a litter of new puppies.
Spaying/neutering not only helps you and your pet get through its adolescence together, but it can help your dog live a longer, healthier life by preventing cancer and other maladies.Use the ASPCA’s low-cost spay/neuter program database at http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/low-cost-spayneuter-programs to find a location near you that offers affordable spaying/neutering. Alternately, contact your vet and ask them to spay or neuter your dog.

, Surviving puppy adolescence means ensuring your dog stays on track with its elimination behavior – whether that means scratching at the door to go “out,” waiting to do its business until it gets taken for a walk, or some other habit. Administer a treat when it voids in the right place and at the right time.For instance, if your dog poos and urinates in the backyard, monitor your dog’s behavior. When it does its business, give it a doggie snack and verbal praise like “Good dog!” when it returns inside.

, Sometimes, barking and staring at another dog is just part of the socialization process. Dogs might pretend to be aggressive (for instance, by posturing, barking, or swatting at each other) without ever actually being aggressive. Other times, however, conflict with other dogs calls for more serious action.The best way to evaluate whether your dog really has a behavior problem is to calculate its “fight-to-bite” ratio.
Add up the number of conflicts your dog has been in with another dog, then add up the number of altercations that ended with the other dog involved in the conflict seriously injured?
If your dog has been in at least 10 altercations with other dogs and has not caused serious damage to any of them, your dog is not really in need of behavior reform.
Muzzle your dog if necessary. If your dog has sent another dog to the hospital in one (or more) conflicts out of ten, you should enlist it in an intense behavioral training school and muzzle it when in public places.

, Provide your dog with a regular schedule. Give your dog breakfast, lunch, and dinner at the same time each day. Wake up and go to bed each day. Go for walks and watch TV with your dog at roughly the same time each day. And most importantly, correct your dog’s misbehavior in the same way each time it acts up.The more predictable your dog’s day is, and the more predictable you are, the less likely your dog is to do something you don’t appreciate.
Regularity will prevent confusion, which can cause your adolescent dog to feel afraid and upset.

, Pheromones are natural scents which are undetectable to humans, but can have profound effects on behavior, especially in animals. Certain products – pheromone collars – can harness the power of these pheromones and exercise a calming influence on your adolescent dog. The pheromone collar works just like a regular collar – just snap it around your dog’s neck and let it work its magic.You can get a pheromone collar at your local pet store.
Consult manufacturer directions for specifics regarding how long your pheromone collar will remain effective.
A similar gadget, the pheromone diffuser, has the same effect as the pheromone collar. But instead of wearing it, you simply place the diffuser in a room in your house. Plug it in, turn it on, and your adolescent dog will soon find itself in a cloud of relaxing pheromones.

, Your puppy should visit the vet at least once during adolescence, around its six month-old mark.You should also see a vet whenever your adolescent puppy exhibits any abnormal behavior or adverse health conditions such as:not eating much
losing weight
coughing
shivering
yelping in pain while walking
difficulty moving about
voiding itself in inappropriate places

Consider seeing a professional trainer.",How to Get a Puppy to Stop Growling when You Pick Them Up," The best way to teach your puppy a command or to teach your puppy that certain behaviors are not acceptable is through positive reinforcement. This simply means praising appropriate behavior instead of attempting to punish inappropriate behavior. You can weed out improper behavior by giving your puppy motivation to behave in the ways that he know will get him praise and treats., One of the most important aspects of training via positive reinforcement is consistency since your puppy will only understand through repetition. The first thing to be consistent about is the word you use to communicate to your puppy that you want him to stop growling. “Quiet” is the most common phrase for this.Once your puppy understands the meaning of “quiet,” you can also use this command for inappropriate barking, whining, and other vocalizations.Always ensure that the puppy isn’t actually vocalizing for good reason before issuing the command.

, If the puppy doesn’t start growling as soon as you pick him up, then provide verbal praise by telling him he’s a good boy in a soft voice. You should also keep several small pieces of treat in your pocket and give him a nibble-size bite of treat while he remains quiet and docile as you hold him.To ensure that you’re not giving puppy too much in the way of treats as you train, use very small pieces—pea-sized even., You want the puppy to begin associating the treats with the quiet, calm behavior he shows when you hold him. As soon as the puppy starts growling, stop giving him praise and treats. However, do not put him down. If you also put the puppy down when he starts growling, then he’ll begin associating growling with you putting him down, which will only strengthen the behavior instead of eliminating it., If you’ve chosen “quiet” as the command, use it now after you’ve stopped giving the puppy treats.Use a stern tone but not one that is loud or so aggressive that it will scare the puppy. If you issue the command in a soft tone, then the puppy will only think it’s more praise since that’s the same tone you use for the positive reinforcement.


Only use the command once and then wait for the puppy to stop. Repeating the phrase over and over will only make it harder for the puppy to associate it with the desired behavior.

, As soon as the puppy stops growling for several seconds, provide more praise and treats.You may have to wait a minute for the puppy to give up on the growling behavior, but give him more treats and praise as soon as he stops. It won’t happen immediately, but the puppy will begin to understand after days (or weeks) or repetitions that you’re pleased and give small treats when he’s quiet while being held and that all of that positive reinforcement ceases when he growls.

, Always end on a moment of positive reinforcement. Though you may have to wait for the puppy to stop growling even when you yourself are ready to put him down, always end the training sessions on moments of positive reinforcement. Wait for the puppy to stop growling, give him the praise and treats, and then finally put him back down.


To help avoid too much reliance on treats, you can also use other forms of positive reinforcement. For instance, when you’re ready to put the puppy down, wait for him to stop growling and then offer him praise and immediately give him his favorite toy to play with when you set him down.

, Puppies will only learn the behavior if you show extreme consistency in providing and taking away the positive reinforcement. Mixed messages does not work in puppy training.Be diligent when it comes to providing the puppy with praise, treats, and his toys for displaying the proper behavior.


This means that everyone in the household has to do their part in the training process as well. Your puppy won’t learn if you’re the only one trying to teach. Ensure that everyone who handles the puppy uses the same process of providing positive reinforcement., Some puppies may catch onto the command after only a few repetitions, whereas other puppies may need weeks to catch on. Have patience because with consistency, the puppy will eventually learn.


Never get so frustrated that you scold or swat the puppy. Dogs understand when you’re angry at them but rarely why you’re angry, so punishments can confuse your dog. Stick with positive reinforcement.

, As your puppy learns what behavior you expect of him when he’s held and when you issue the “quiet” command, you can reduce the frequency at which you provide treats for obedience. While you should decrease the dependence on treats, always continue remaining consistent with other forms of positive reinforcement, especially praise.Initially, provide a treat four out of every five times that your puppy obeys and displays the correct behavior. As he begins responding regularly to the “quiet” command, then reduce to three out of five times and continue reducing at slow intervals. When your puppy fully understands and consistently obeys all the time, you can reduce to only providing an occasional treat.Vary the reinforcement schedule. Your puppy is smarter than you may realize, and he’ll catch on if you consistently provide treats every other time, which can lead to him only obeying every other time. Use a schedule that’ll keep him trying to please you and receive his treats., Your puppy may simply be growling because he doesn’t like the way you pick him up or because you hold him in an uncomfortable manner. Though common, puppies do not like being picked up under the arms and lifted that way. It can even hurt the puppy.


Instead, put one hand on the puppy’s chest and stomach and use the other hand to scoop him up by his rear end. This is a safer way to pick up the puppy.When holding, cradle the puppy into your chest or abdomen to help the puppy feel safe and secure., If your puppy is growling at everyone, then consider that he just might not like being picked up. Dogs are meant to be running around and exploring. It is not natural or normal for dogs to be carried and the puppy might feel uncomfortable being handled in this way. It may be more of a fearful reaction at the situation than an aggressive reaction., If your puppy is fine with you picking him up but begins growling shortly after, then you can deflect the behavior with a toy. Ensure that you give the puppy the toy before he starts growling. Otherwise he can mistake the toy as a reward for the growling.


A toy is also a good way to deflect a puppy that is too mouthy—playfully bites at your arms or hands—when you pick him up.

, Your puppy will likely growl at other times in addition to when you pick him up. He may growl when playing with other puppies, when playing with toys, etc. Growling during play is normal, and you may not want to “quiet” the puppy during these moments. If your puppy is bouncing around, has a playful expression with his mouth open, and “play bows”—bounces down into a position with his front paws down and his rear end in the air—then he’s simply playing and not trying to shown real aggression or dominance.Dogs growling to express aggression or dominance are much more likely to stare directly at the source, have ears back, and mouths tight—possibly while baring their teeth.Aggressive growling will also be accompanied by a dog that’s holding very still and is focused.
If your puppy ever growls when someone else approaches him as he eats, then he’s showing signs of food-related aggression. Contact a certified animal behaviorist in your area to help eliminate aggressive behavior related to food., If after several weeks of training, your puppy still hasn’t gotten the hang of the command and still growls, then look into professional training. A trainer will examine how you’ve been issuing the command and correct any inconsistencies that may be confusing your puppy.

Let your puppy lead you.,
Encourage your puppy to walk beside you.",How to Get a Puppy Used to a Leash," Before your puppy can get used to a leash, it first needs to be comfortable with wearing a collar. Choose a wide, flat, and light collar so your puppy will forget it’s even wearing a collar. Also, choose a snap collar, which is easier to take on and off than a buckle collar.Select a collar that fits your puppy now, not one that your puppy can grow into. A collar that’s too big may feel heavy around your puppy’s neck.;
, When your puppy is calm, gently put the collar around its neck. Check the collar’s fit by putting two fingers between the collar and your puppy’s neck. If your fingers don’t fit, the collar is too tight. If your fingers fit snugly, the collar is just right.Adjust the collar, if necessary. If your fingers still don't fit snugly, purchase another collar.
Your puppy will probably fuss and squirm when the collar is on. Ignore the fuss. Eventually, your puppy will forget that it’s on., To keep your puppy from fussing a lot with the collar, distract your puppy with a fun activity, such as eating or playing. Put the collar on right before meal time so your puppy will be distracted with eating while the collar is on.Consider putting the collar on before playtime.Your puppy will be so busy playing with you that it will forget about its collar.
Play an interactive game with your puppy, such as rolling a ball on the floor and having your puppy chase after it.

, The first day your puppy wears the collar, leave it on for 5 minutes. Practice this several times, with about 45 minutes between practice sessions. Over the next 2 weeks, gradually increase the amount of time your puppy wears the collar.Your puppy does not have wear the collar all day. Because puppies like to run and explore, the collar could be dangerous, since it could get caught on something and cause your puppy to panic.Keep the collar on only during practice sessions.
If you’re unsure about how long to leave the collar on your puppy, ask your vet for guidance.

, No matter how much your puppy squirms when the collar is on, wait until your puppy is calm before taking the collar off. If you take it off when your puppy is worked up, your puppy will think you’re rewarding the squirmy behavior., Treats are a great way to get your puppy used to its collar. If you want to give your puppy treats, give small morsels so your puppy can chew them quickly.Choose when to give the treats:


As soon as you put the collar on: this will let your puppy know that wearing the collar is a good thing.While the puppy is wearing the collar: this will distract your puppy.

Not when you take the collar off: your puppy will think that having the collar removed is the reward., After your puppy is comfortable with the collar, it will need to get used to a leash. The first leash you use with your puppy should be lightweight.Cut the loop out of the leash so your puppy’s paws don’t get stuck in the loop.As your puppy grows, you may need to buy a bigger and sturdier leash.

, As with the collar, the leash may seem strange to your puppy. After putting the collar on, attach the leash to the collar and let your puppy drag the leash around the house for about 15 minutes at a time. Supervise your puppy so the leash doesn’t get caught on something and cause your puppy to panic.The leash will put a little bit of pressure on your puppy’s neck.Your puppy will need to get comfortable with this pressure before you start holding the leash.
Attach the leash, without holding it, a few times per day for at least a few days.

, If your puppy seems to get squirmy or fussy with the leash, distract your puppy with toys. You can also put the leash on right before a scheduled playtime, or before practicing basic commands (sit, stay).If you put the leash on before playtime, your puppy will start associating the leash with something fun.Small bits of treats can also distract your puppy.

, As with the collar, take the leash off only when your puppy is calm. Do not reward your puppy after you take the leash off.

, Once your puppy is used to the collar and leash, start walking with your puppy. Your puppy won’t be ready for an outdoor walk, so practice walking inside first. After you put the leash and collar on your puppy, gently pick up the leash and walk with your puppy.Keep the leash at the height of your waist and talk to your puppy in a bright, encouraging voice (Great job! Let’s go walking!)., The first time you pick up the leash, don’t expect your puppy to start walking beside you. Instead, follow your puppy and let it get used to the pressure of you holding the leash. If your puppy starts pulling, turn and walk in a different direction, without yanking the leash.To stop the pulling, you can also stop walking and entice your puppy back to you with a treat.Continue walking after your puppy comes back to you and you give it the treat.
Do not pull on the leash yourself. If you start pulling, then your puppy may start pulling, too.Do not hold the leash too tightly as you follow your puppy. A tight leash can actually encourage a puppy to start pulling., During your walks, your puppy should walk beside you, not in front of you. To encourage your puppy to heel, hold some treats in your hand as you walk.Give your puppy treats as it walks beside you so it learns that walking beside you is a good thing.


Keep your hand low so your puppy does not have to jump to get the treats.Let your puppy get used to you holding the leash before you begin practicing the 'heel' command.

Make sure they get plenty of play time.,
Feed your puppy three hours before bedtime.,
Schedule potty breaks.",How to Get a Puppy to Sleep1," Because puppies are growing, they need at least 17 hours of sleep per day. This means that your puppy will be napping a lot throughout the day. However, you can control when your puppy sleeps by developing a routine. Limit your puppy’s naps to the morning, middle of the day, and the afternoon. Make sure to reserve evenings for play time.Make sure your puppy is good and tired for bedtime by stimulating their mind and body with age-appropriate games and toys. For example, take your puppy outside so they can run around, sniff, dig in the yard, and exhaust their pent up energy.
You can also start teaching your puppy basic commands like ""sit"" and ""come."" These physical and mental activities in the evening will ensure that your puppy is ready for bedtime.;
, Do not feed your puppy right before bedtime. By feeding them right before bedtime, you are ensuring that they will wake up and need to poop during the night. Instead, feed your puppy at least three hours before bedtime.Three to four hours is enough time for your puppy to eat, digest, and use the restroom.

, Before putting your puppy to sleep, schedule a potty break. This will encourage your puppy to sleep peacefully through the night.If you have a very young puppy, however, you will need to take them out during the night as well. As a rule of thumb, a pup can hold their bladder for their age in months plus one hour (so a two-month-old pup can wait three hours). If you have a two-month-old puppy that begins crying three hours after bedtime, then they're trying to let you know they need to go potty.


It is important you approach the puppy in a way that will not encourage the crying behavior. Wait until there is a gap in the whining, as this rewards their silence, not the crying. When you take the puppy out, keep things as low-key as possible. Keep the lights dim, avoid speaking to the pup, and don't play with them. Take the pup to their toilet spot, a brief praise when they perform, and then straight back to bed. This teaches them that nighttime is for sleep, not for play.

"
"
Know what to do when they cry.,
Place their crate in your room.,
Give them an article of your clothing.,
Make sure their bed is comfortable.",How to Get a Puppy to Sleep2," Often owners accidentally train their puppy to wake and seek attention during the night because of how they respond when the puppy wakes. If the pup cries during the night, don't respond straight away — this will reward the behavior and teach them that whining is how they get attention. Instead, if you feel the puppy needs to be checked, wait for a lull between cries and then respond, so the silence is rewarded rather than the crying.

, Placing your puppy’s crate in your room will help them settle and sleep at night. Your presence in the room will comfort them during the night as opposed to an empty, unfamiliar room.Placing their crate in your room will also help you monitor them in case they need to go to the bathroom during the night.

, If your puppy still won’t sleep, or you choose to place the crate in another room, give them an article of your clothing. Your puppy will be comforted by your scent, and thus, will be more likely to sleep undisturbed through the night.Additionally, placing a radio or a ticking clock wrapped in a cloth in their crate or bed will soothe your puppy and help them sleep. Play soft music on a low setting to encourage them to fall asleep.

, Your puppy’s crate or bed should be appealing, and your puppy should associate their bed with positivity. In other words, their bed should be comfortable and warm. Place blankets and soft toys in their bed to ensure that they are warm and comfortable throughout the night.Consider the temperature and time of year when deciding how many blankets to give to your puppy. For example, your puppy might get hot if you give them too many blankets during the summer.
Never use bedtime as punishment. If you do, your puppy might develop an anxiety toward bedtime, and thus, they will be more reluctant to sleep.

Start early.,
Contact breeding clubs.,
Post a profile on an adoption website.,
Tell other people.",How to Find Good Homes for Your Litter of Puppies1," You should start looking for homes for the litter before they are even born. Not only will this give you time to screen potential adopters but it can also help you find a new home for a puppy if an adopter backs out. If the puppies have already been born, you should start looking for homes immediately., If the puppies are purebred, you should contact the breeding club that the dog is registered with. This can be a national kennel club, such as the American Kennel Club or the United Kennel Club, or this might be a breed-specific club. Breeding clubs can help you find experienced owners. They can also provide references for potential adopters who have owned the breed before.You should look into registering the puppies with their breeding club as soon as possible. This can help you find good homes for the puppies as registered puppies may be more attractive to certain adopters.

, If the puppies have already been born, you can try positing individual profiles for each puppy on an adoption website. Here you can list the puppy’s temperament, age, breed, and other details. You should post a picture of the puppy as well. Potential adopters will contact you through the site.Some good adoption websites include:


Petfinder
All Paws
Adopt a Pet

, Word of mouth is a powerful tool. Start telling your friends and family that you will have a litter of puppies to adopt out. Ask them if they know of anyone who wants to adopt a puppy.You can even post on your social media pages that you have puppies who need homes.

Let the mother dog take care of controlling the puppies’ temperatures.,
Keep the room warm.,
Use body heat to warm a cool puppy.",How to Get a Litter of Puppies to Sleep1," The mother’s body heat is usually best in modulating the pups’ temperatures. As long as the room is warm enough, the mother will have no trouble keeping the puppies warm. A warm puppy is a sleepy puppy., For the first week the temperature should be kept from 85 to 90 degrees, 80 to 85 degrees for the second, 75 to 80 for the third, and 70 to 75 for the fourth. After that, the temperature can stay around 70 to 75 degrees.Don’t get the room too warm, as the puppy can get hyperthermia., If the puppy litter doesn’t have a mother for some reason, then you’ll need to warm the puppy. Use your body heat first, and once the puppy’s stabilized, you can use other methods such as heating pads and heat lamps. The puppy should sleep once it’s temperature has been stabilized."
"
Buy necessary supplies.To feed a newborn puppy you will need a bottle made specially for feeding newborn puppies and milk replacement formula.,
Clean and sterilize the equipment.If you buy a bottle that is made to feed newborn puppies, it should have sterilizing instructions on the packaging.,
Calculate how much to feed the puppy.,
Prepare the milk replacement.Follow the directions on the packaging that the replacement came in.,
Weigh the puppy.,
Keep the puppy's head level while feeding it.,
Burp the puppy after each feeding.,
Feed a newborn puppy every two hours.,
Look for signs the puppy is getting too much food.,
Get the puppy checked out by a veterinarian.,
Make emergency puppy milk replacement.,
Warm the milk.,
Use supplies from around the house.,
Switch to commercial milk replacement as soon as possible.",How to Feed Orphaned Newborn Puppies," The bottle and formula can both be purchased at most large pet supply stores or online.


You will also need to be able to sterilize the bottle. This means that you will need access to a pan and a stove to heat water on.;
, However, if you do not have any instructions, be sure to clean the bottle thoroughly and then rinse it to make sure all soap residue is completely gone. Then place all pieces of the bottle into boiling water for a few minutes to sterilize them.


It only takes a few minutes to sterilize a bottle. You do not need to sterilize the bottle for more than five minutes.

, The amount of milk replacement that you give to the puppy depends on its weight and its age. The package that the replacement comes in should have suggested amounts for the age and weight of the puppy. However, typically a newborn puppy will eat one ounce of formula for every half pound (8 oz.) of weight over a 24 hour period. This means that if your puppy weighs one pound, it will only eat two ounces of formula spread out over the day.The amount your dog will need to eat in a 24 hour period will need to be divided by the number of feedings you plan on giving it.
Calculating how much food to feed the puppy before you prepare the formula is important because you should only make enough food to feed to the puppy for one day. This will assure that the milk does not ferment or go bad and cause health problems for the puppy., This usually entails adding a set amount of formula to a set amount of water and stirring.Depending on the formula that you have bought, it may also suggest heating the water to a certain temperature before adding in the formula powder.

, In order to assess whether your puppy is getting enough food, you should weigh it before every feeding. In general, it should be gaining ten percent of its body weight every day. This repeated weighing also helps you to gauge whether you are feeding the puppy the right amount of food.The amount of milk replacement you feed your puppy depends on its weight. If it is quickly gaining weight then you will need to adjust the amount you are feeding it. Consult the directions on the packaging for specific amounts.

, One of the most important things to remember when feeding a puppy is to try and keep the milk out of its lungs. Newborn puppies are not developed enough to keep things they are eating from going into their lungs if their heads are tilted up.Keep your puppy's body horizontal while feeding. When you put the bottle nipple into its mouth, you should keep the bottle horizontal as well. This assures that the puppy does not life its head while feeding.
While feeding, you will probably not be able to tell if the dog is getting milk into its lungs because a small puppy's gag reflex is not well developed at birth.

, Just like human babies, puppies need to be burped after they are fed. Hold the puppy upright and place it against your shoulder. Then pat the puppy's back lightly in order to help it release any gas that has built up in its system.If a puppy is not burped it can become very uncomfortable and it can even be in pain due to the buildup of gas in its system.

, Very young puppies need to eat many times each day. This can be a lot of work, especially if the puppy is very, very young. However, it is essential to the proper development of the puppy.A newborn puppy needs to be fed twelve times a day. This means every two hours, even at night.
A puppy that is one week old should be fed eight to ten times a day.
A four week old puppy should be fed four times a day.

, If your puppy is getting diarrhea then it may be getting fed too much food. At the first sign of diarrhea, try reducing the amount of food you are feeding it slightly and see if that clears up the condition.A newborn puppy with diarrhea can get severely dehydrated quickly. If the diarrhea continues for more than a day, then you should get the puppy looked at by a veterinarian.

, To assure that the puppy is gaining enough weight, and to assure that it is otherwise healthy, you should get it assessed by a veterinarian. The veterinarian will likely ask you a variety of questions about how you have been caring for the orphaned puppy and they will also complete a physical examination.


If you have any specific questions about how to care for the puppy going forward, this is a good time to ask those questions.

, If you cannot get commercial milk replacement immediately, then you can make a replacement with household items. Remember, however, that this mixture should only be used in an emergency, as it does not have the complete nutrition that a newborn puppy needs. To make the emergency puppy milk replacement mix together:


1 cup of whole milk (cow or goat)
1 tablespoon oil
1 pinch of salt
3 egg yolks (no whites)

, Puppies that have just been born may need the milk they drink warmed a bit. Just as with commercial milk replacement, this emergency milk replacement should be warmed to 95 to 100 degrees. This will help to encourage that the puppy drinks it.Be careful to heat it slowly and do not overheat it. The yolks will cook if it is heated to quickly or heated too much.
If you warm the milk in the microwave, do it in short increments (5-10 seconds) and stir it several times while heating. This will reduce the risk of hot spots.
Be sure to test the temperature of the milk before giving it to the puppy. Very hot milk could seriously injure a newborn puppy.

, If you don't have a bottle specifically designed to feed a newborn puppy, then you may have to use items from your home temporarily. If you have a medicine dropper or syringe that can be cleaned and sterilized, then you can try to use that. If you don't have a dropper or syringe, then you will have to use a little spoon.Feeding a newborn puppy with a bottle designed for it will be much, much easier than using a dropper or a spoon. If you have the ability to go get a bottle at your local pet store, do it.

, Emergency milk replacement cannot fulfill all of the puppy's nutritional needs as it grows. Commercial products are specially formulated to give the puppy the wide variety of vitamins and nutrients that are present in a mother dog's milk.While the emergency replacement can keep a newborn puppy alive in an emergency, it can be detrimental to a dog's growth if used for too long. Only use the emergency milk replacement for a few days while you work to obtain the commercial product."

Keep bedtime calm.,
Give your pup a chew toy.,
Consult your veterinarian.",How to Get a Puppy to Sleep3," While it is advised to limit play time and exercise to the evening, try to avoid playing intense games right before bedtime. About an hour or so before bedtime, begin winding down your puppy. Stop playing any games and initiate a quiet time in the house.Quiet time can consist of quietly lying on the couch while reading a book, watching TV, or listening to soft music on a low volume.

, Teething can also cause your puppy to wake up crying or whining during the night. Remedy a teething puppy by placing chew toys in their bed. This way, if pain causes your puppy to awake during the night, they will be able to comfort themselves with chew toys.


Kongs, hard rubber or nylon toys, and thick rope toys are great for soothing a teething puppy’s mouth., If you have tried different techniques, but your puppy still will not sleep, consider taking them to the veterinarian. By consulting your vet, you can rule out any possible health issues that might be preventing your puppy from getting a good night’s rest.


Additionally, some dog breeds sleep more than others; therefore, knowing the activity levels of your puppy’s breed will help you determine how to get them to sleep better.
Ask your vet, ""I have tried various methods to help my puppy sleep at night, however, none of them seem to be working. Could my puppy have a health problem?""
Also ask, ""I want to make sure my puppy is getting the necessary amount of physical and mental activity each day. What are the activity levels of their breed, and how can I meet them?""

Research potential adopters.,
Interview candidates.,
Ask for references.,
Perform a home visit.,
Allow candidates to visit the puppies.",How to Find Good Homes for Your Litter of Puppies2," You should perform a basic background check on interested parties to make sure that they do not have a history of animal abuse, irresponsible breeding, or selling puppies for profit. Ask for a copy of their driver’s license or ID.Verify that they live at that home address, and perform a basic internet search to see if any unsavory details pop up.

, Before you agree to hand over a puppy to a stranger, you should thoroughly investigate them to make sure that they are capable and willing to raise the puppy properly. A good home will be one where the owners provide the dog with enough attention, exercise, food, and medical care. You also want to ascertain that the candidates are absolutely aware and dedicated to the time and effort that raising a puppy requires.You can ask:


What do you want a puppy for? Are you looking to have a family pet or do you want to breed the puppy?
Have you ever owned a dog before? If so, can you tell me about them?
Are you aware of what type of care this dog needs?
What is your job? How many hours a day will the puppy be alone?
Do you live in a house or an apartment? Do you have a fenced-in yard?
Are there children in the home? Are there other pets in the home? If so, how do you plan on introducing them to the puppy?

, Puppies are not an ideal choice for first-time dog owners. To make sure that the adopter is an experienced and loving owner, you should ask for references from their vet. This will inform you how well this person cared for previous pets.


If you have a litter of purebred puppies, you might want to ask adopters if they have a reference from the breeding club. This reference will let you know that they have successfully owned a dog of this breed before and that they are aware of the breed’s specific needs. If they have never owned the breed before but have experience with other dogs, a vet’s referral may still be adequate., Some adopters might lie to you about their address, home, or living conditions. To make sure that the puppy does not end up in a puppy mill, shelter, or otherwise bad home, ask the adopter if they would be willing to let you do a home check. Schedule a time when you can visit.This will allow you to make sure that the address they provided you is accurate. You can also see the size of the home, whether or not there is a yard, and whether the home would be safe for a puppy. A quiet, clean home is ideal for a puppy.
Apartments may be fine for smaller or more inactive breeds of dogs. Larger or energetic dogs may need a bigger home and a fenced-in yard.
Do not do a home visit by yourself. Always bring a friend along when you are visiting a stranger’s house.

, Once you have a few potential adopters who you think might be suitable, you should schedule a time when they can come to visit the puppies. This will let them experience the temperament of the puppy while letting you see how well they handle puppies. It will also give you another chance to ask them questions about their suitability to own a puppy. You should always have another person home when strangers come to visit.If the puppies are old enough, you should let them play with their potential new owners.
This may be a good opportunity to have the candidates sign a contract and finalize their commitment to the puppy.
If something seems wrong about the adopter or if new information pops up that makes you reconsider, do not be afraid to tell them that you will not give the puppy to them. You can say, “After some consideration, I do not think you would be a good candidate for this dog.”"
"
Establish basic requirements for care.,
Establish a return policy.,
Add a spay/neuter clause.,
Have the new owners sign it.",How to Find Good Homes for Your Litter of Puppies3," The contract should spell out the minimum level of care that you expect for the puppy. While you cannot specify every aspect of the puppies care, this can reassure you that the puppy will be treated well. It can also help the new owner understand how to care for the puppy. You can require that:The puppy will be fed an adequate amount of food every day.
The puppy will be disciplined using positive reinforcement and not physical punishment.
The puppy will receive the right amount of exercise for their temperament and breed.
The puppy will have a comfortable, quiet place to sleep.
The puppy will live inside.
The puppy will be microchipped.

, Your contract should stipulate that the buyer may not resell the puppy. This will prevent puppy mills or unscrupulous buyers from selling puppies at a profit. The contract should also state that if the new owner can no longer care for the puppy, you will be informed first. The new owner must offer you the puppy before they take the dog to a shelter.


If you are a responsible breeder, you are obliged to readopt the puppy at any point of their life should the new owner be unable to care for them., To prevent the puppy from ending up in a puppy mill or as a backyard breeder, you should add a statement in the contract stating that the new owner will not breed the puppy. To ensure this, both you and the new owner should agree that the dog will be spayed or neutered before going into their new home. You will then be responsible for spaying or neutering the dog.If someone wants the puppy to breed, they should be able to present a reference or credentials from a breeding club, the American Kennel Club, and/or the United Kennel Club. Without these references, you should not knowingly give away a puppy to be bred.

, Once you have discussed the contract with the potential adopters, you should have them sign it. You may want to get it notarized, just in case. If the adopter does not want to sign it or if they refuse to agree to certain clauses, you may want to find somebody else.

Wait until the puppy is old enough.,
Provide the puppy with all of their necessary shots.,
Provide the new owner with information about the puppy.,
Avoid placing them in a shelter.",How to Find Good Homes for Your Litter of Puppies4," Puppies should not be separated from their mothers before eight weeks of age. Some breeders wait until the puppy is ten weeks old. This will ensure that the puppy can thrive on their own., You cannot guarantee that the new owner will give the puppy their necessary vaccinations and medical treatments. To make sure that the puppy does not fall ill, take the entire litter to the vet to be vaccinated before you give them away.


Between six and eight weeks of age, the puppies should have distemper, measles, parainfluenza, and Bordetella shots.
Between eight and ten weeks of age, they should have shots for distemper, adenovirus (hepatitis), parainfluenza, and parvovirus. Vaccinations for coronavirus, leptospirosis, and Lyme disease are optional but recommended., Each new owner should be given a packet that explains the puppy’s temperament, breed, feeding needs, and a basic outline of a puppy’s development over the first year of life. The new owner should also be given the puppy’s medical records.Puppies can get sick if the brand or type of food they are fed is switched too suddenly. You may want to give the new owner a small bag of the brand of food you have been feeding them., If you cannot place puppies with a good home, you are responsible for raising them. A responsible breeder will not abandon puppies at a shelter. Many puppies are killed within two weeks of being left at a shelter. Continue looking for new homes for the puppies but care for them as though they are your dogs.If you have too many puppies to handle, you might find them temporary foster homes until you can find them a permanent home.

Let your pup explore the backyard.,
Bury a treat.,
Build a kibble trail.,
Buy age appropriate toys.,
Encourage play with other puppies.",How to Exercise Your Puppy1," For puppies under 18 months of age, self-directed play will fulfill your puppy’s exercise needs. In other words, the majority of your puppy’s exercise should be exploring, digging, and free play. Therefore, let your puppy roam around your backyard, or an enclosed grassy area that is safe.While your puppy is exploring, supervise your puppy to ensure that it is safe at all times.
If you don't have a backyard, then take your puppy to a park and let your puppy explore a small section of the park. Supervise your puppy at all times.;
, Burying treats is a great way for your puppy to exercise and hone its tracking instincts. Dig up various soft patches in your backyard. Bury treats and toys in the patches and cover them up. Lead your puppy to the patches and encourage it to dig up the treats and toys., Kibble trails will also keep your puppy busy both mentally and physically. Start with half of the amount of kibble you feed your puppy in a day. Drop the kibble every few inches making a trail as you go along. Start out with straight trails and work your way up to trails with turns.Make sure to put a lot of food along turns since a change of direction is hard to follow.

, Puppies begin teething around three months of age. Therefore, make sure your puppy has a lot of safe and sturdy teething toys, for example, a Kong-type toy or Nylabone toys. In general, opt for hard rubber toys, or toys that have multiple textures that your puppy can explore.Avoid toys that are too small or contain small pieces that can be chewed off and ingested.
Avoid toys that have sharp edges. These toys can harm your puppy's mouth and/or teeth.

, Playing with other puppies is another great way to fulfill your puppy’s exercise, as well as socialization needs. Puppies are ideal playmates for each other because they have similar needs and limits. Invite your friends to bring their puppies over for a much needed play session.At seven weeks of age, you can begin to gradually expose your puppy to a variety of situations, people, and places.
Try not to let your puppy play with larger dogs or puppies. Larger dogs, especially ones that like to play rough, can inadvertently hurt your puppy.
Do not take your puppy to the dog park until seven to 10 days after it has received its full series of puppy vaccinations."

Don’t disturb a sleeping puppy.,
Make sure the litter is in a low-traffic area of the house.,
Keep noise in the house to a minimum during the first few weeks.",How to Get a Litter of Puppies to Sleep2," Puppies need sleep for healthy development. If the puppies are sleeping, you should let them sleep. If you need to clean the box, you can wake them temporarily, but try not to disturb them too often. Also, if you disturb the puppies too much the mother can get touchy and may move her pups., This will help ensure that the puppies are getting the quiet they need. It will also help the mother feel safer about her pups. A kitchen is not an ideal place, but an out-of-the way pantry or laundry room may be better., If you have children, this might mean reminding them that there are sleeping puppies in the house. You’ll want to avoid having large social gatherings or lots of guests during the first few weeks of the puppies’ lives. This will help them sleep soundly and stay healthy."
"
Make sure the mother and litter are in an area that feels safe.,
Provide plenty of padding for the puppies and their mother.,
Make sure the area or box is big enough.",How to Get a Litter of Puppies to Sleep3," Oftentimes, this will be a closed-in area such as a closet or a corner of a bedroom. If a mother has chosen an area that is out of the way and not dangerous (such as near dangerous chemicals, etc.), then it’s best to work around the mother’s choices. If the mother is calm and happy, then her pups are likely to sleep better. And if the mother’s not happy with the place, she’s more likely to move them and that will certainly disrupt their sleep., You’ll want to make sure the materials you use are safe for puppies, as puppies are more susceptible to toxins at an early age. If you use blankets, you may want to use older ones, as the puppies may stain them. If you use padding, make sure to change it every couple of days or so., You’ll want the mother and the puppies to be able to stretch out comfortably in their space. This will help the mother is at ease. You’ll also want to make sure the mother can get out of the box when needed."
"
Watch puppies’ behavior.,
Make sure all puppies are nursing regularly.,
Call the vet if one of the puppies won’t sleep, or doesn’t sleep very much.",How to Get a Litter of Puppies to Sleep4," Normal puppies will curl up in their sleep and twitch. They will also sleep about 90% of the time. Really, if a puppy is perfectly healthy, they should have no trouble sleeping. They will also nurse eagerly and they shouldn’t whine that much. , Regular nursing is a sign of health. The puppies should nurse eagerly. They will do so regularly and without help. If they stop or seem unenthusiastic about nursing, it may be time to call the vet.If a puppy doesn't have a mother, you'll have to feed it by hand. Make sure you warm up the puppy milk replacer (formula for puppies) to around 98-100 degrees before giving it to the puppies. This will mimic the temperature of their mother's milk and help them sleep. You can find puppy milk replacer at you local pet store., Newborn puppies should sleep. If they won’t, it is possible they may have fading puppy syndrome and need to see a vet immediately. Talk to the vet about the appropriate means of transport to the vet, or see if the vet can come to you. The puppy’s immune system is very weak as a newborn, so you won’t want to take any risks in taking the puppy to the vet."

Sign your puppy up for a class.,
Teach your puppy the basic commands.,
Introduce your puppy to the leash.",How to Exercise Your Puppy2," A puppy-training class will teach your puppy basic commands, like sit, come, and stay. It will also teach your puppy basic manners, how to socialize with other people and dogs, and loose-leash walking.These classes are available for puppies that are 10 weeks to five months of age.
You can find training classes at your local pet store.

, Teaching your puppy the basic commands, like sit, stay, and come, is a great mental, as well as physical, exercise. Start by teaching your puppy the sit command.


Sit down next to your puppy. Place a hand on its chest and another hand on top of its rump, i.e., just behind the rear legs near the tail. Say ""sit"" as you apply gentle pressure to the chest and its rear. Guide your puppy into a sitting position. Once it is in the sitting position, give your puppy a treat. Repeat this at least once a day until your puppy understands the sit command., Before you begin walking your puppy, you will need to introduce your puppy to the leash. Let your puppy sniff and see the collar. Reward your puppy with a treat for allowing the collar to be near it. Then, place the collar around your puppy’s neck. Have the collar around its neck for only a few minutes at at ime. Gradually increase the amount of time your puppy wears the collar.
Make sure to reward your puppy with treats for good behavior.

Consult your vet.,
Take your puppy for short, informal walks.,
Save strenuous exercise for later.",How to Exercise Your Puppy3," Always consult your vet regarding your puppy’s exercise needs and the best methods to fulfill these needs, first. The amount and type of exercise your puppy needs depends on its breed and size.


Ask your vet, ""I would like to know what the exercise protocols are for my puppy. When should I begin exercising my puppy, and what exercises do you recommend?""

, Do not take your puppy for long, strenuous walks. Instead, take your puppy for short, informal walks. Allow your puppy time to sniff and explore as you walk. It is recommended that a puppy have no more than five minutes of walking for every month of its age.For example, if your puppy is three months old, then a 15 minute walk is sufficient.
Puppies under three months of age do not need to be walked, especially if they have not been vaccinated.
Stop the walk immediately if you notice signs of over exertion such as stopping, lying down, lagging behind, and/or panting.

, Activities like climbing stairs, long and face paced walks, hiking, playing fetch, jogging or running, and frisbee throwing should be avoided. These activities are strenuous activities that put stress on your puppy’s developing bones and muscles.Stress on your puppy’s bones and muscles at an early age can cause diseases such as hip dysplasia as your puppy gets older.
Tug-of-war type games can harm your puppy's small teeth.

Decide what type of dog is right for you.,
Look for indicators of health.,
Do a temperament test.,
Take your puppy to the nearest vet for check-up, they may find a health issue you missed.,
Be prepared to take the puppy home.,
Train your puppy to match what you want to use him for (a watchdog, a friend, etc).",How to Find and Train a Sheltered Puppy," Research breeds and decide on one or a few that fit your lifestyle.You might decide on making your puppy a family pet, a good friend, a show dog, or a watch dog.


Make sure your landlord allows dogs, if renting.
Anticipate how much time he will need for exercise every day and if you are able to provide it.
Make sure you can afford food, toys, treats, and vet expenses.;
, When you find the puppy you like, before taking it in, ask to examine him/her to see if he/she is sick or injured. If the puppy is sick/injured be prepared to spend your time and money to make the puppy better and see if it is suitable to the surroundings in your house. Specifically check for a constant potbelly, eye discoloration, discharge, general stance, extensive licking one area, or avoidance to putting weight on or being touched in an area., Though these are not 100% reliable (as the puppy's environment helps shape his character), it can provide a good baseline. Before deciding on a puppy it is best to observe the dog to see it's personality and how it acts towards other people, items, animals, noises, and environments. It is also a good idea to see what the dam(mother) and sire(father) are like as your puppy will most likely be very similar in traits.

, See if your puppy needs vaccines or any other treatment. While at the vet you can also get your pet microchipped, which is important for when trying to find him/her when she/he gets lost.

, Before taking the pup home you must have everyday dog essentials ready like a dog bed, food, water/food bowl, dog toys, treats, a dog collar, a dog harness, a kennel, a leash, etc. ..

, This can be achieved through a professional positive reinforcement traineror owner training using resources such as YouTube tutorials or books.

Pull the inner cords out of the paracord about a half inch (1.27cm) and cut them off.,
Flare out (widen) the edges of the circle that you’ve made with the colored paracord covering.,
Melt the other end of each color of paracord with the lighter.,
Using the awl, poke a hole about a quarter inch (1.27cm) from the end of the opened circle of the paracord length in the first color.,
Push the pointed end of one color of paracord through the hole you just made in the opposite color.,
Attach the snaphook.,
Measure the leash by beginning at the snaphook and measuring how long you’d like your leash to be (the example in this tutorial is measured to 4 feet/1.21 meters).,
Begin the cobra weave at the point where you attached the handle core to the leash.,
After you weave completely around the handle, begin weaving (knotting) down the length of the leash core.,
Finish the leash by trimming the paracord down to about a half inch (1.27cm) from the end of the leash.",How to Make a Paracord Dog Leash," Then, pull the colored covering of the paracord to recover the inner cords. Do this on one end of each color.;
, Then melt the edges of the paracord slightly with the lighter, while still maintaining the opening. Be sure to melt all the way around the circle because this will keep the cord strong.

, Pinch together to create a pointed end.

, Make the hole big enough for the second color of paracord to push through. Begin with the smaller awl, then use a larger awl to get the right size. Repeat with the other color of paracord. At this point you should have two colors of paracord that each have one pointed end, and one end with a hole.

, Use the needle nose pliers if you need help pulling it through. Repeat with the opposite ends and pull until both circular ends meet in the middle. You will now have one long piece of paracord.

, Essentially you will be making a double slipknot. First, pull the fused ends through the end of the snaphook. Then, loop it through again. Last, finish the slipknot by threading the rest of the paracord through the loop and pulling tightly to secure. For a smaller dog, one slipknot should be sufficient.

, Hold the spot with your finger, then loop enough paracord to create the core of the leash handle (pictured). This handle is measure to be about 7 inches (17.5cm). The two colors of cord will form the core of the leash. All of the knotting will happen over this core, making the leash strong. Use a twist tie to temporarily secure the handle loop to the leash.

, To do the cobra weave, you will weave (knot) the two colors of paracord over your core. Make a loop with 1 color so that it forms a “D” with the core. The 2nd color will go over the 1st color, under the core and through the “D” so make a knot over the core. Be sure to pull tightly and always begin the knot with the same color to keep your pattern consistent

, Continue pulling tightly until you reach the snaphook.
, Slide down the colored covering of each cord and trim the inner cords as you did in Step 1, then melt the edges and pinch tightly together with the needle nose pliers. Your leash is all finished!

Gather your supplies.,
Measure and cut the cordage into strands.,
Align and secure the strands.,
Separate strands and weave the rightmost strand to the left.,
Repeat this motion to continue braiding.,
Add the collar clip.,
Splice strands into the braided section.,
Splice all the loose strands into the main braid.,
Cut and fuse loose ends in the now-spliced rope.,
Measure and tape the non-clip end.,
Unbraid the strands up to the fastener.,
Create a loop in your cordage.,
Splice strands into the braided rope.,
Remove the fasteners and tighten your spliced strands.,
Continue splicing, then cut and fuse the strands.",How to Make a Braided Rope Dog Leash," This project will yield an average length dog leash, which is about 6 ft (1.8 m). Shorter and longer leashes can be made with the same technique and a longer or shorter starting length of cordage. The following supplies for this project should be available at your local hardware store:Collar clip
Lighter (or hot hobby knife)
Scissors
Small pliers, sturdy tweezers, or forceps
String, durable tape (electrical, duct), or rubber bands
Tape measure (or ruler)
38 ft (11.6 m) of cordage (like nylon or paracord);
, By weaving strands of your cordage into a single braid, you’ll make a stronger leash than a single strand one. Measure and cut your cordage into four equal lengths of 9½ ft (2.9 m).


Fuse the ends of the strands with a lighter or hot hobby knife. Where you have cut the cord, pass the flame of a lighter briefly until the ends melt and fuse.When you cut your cordage, the ends loosen, causing it to unravel. Fusing the ends of cut cords with a lighter or hot hobby knife will prevent unraveling.

, Line up each of your strands of rope so their ends are even. Shortly before one end of the strands, tie a simple knot with string. Alternatively, you can fasten the end firmly with a suitable rubber band or durable tape, like duct or electrical tape. To keep your strands stable while weaving, you may want to firmly tape the fastened end of your strands to a sturdy object, like a work bench.
So long as your strands are evenly aligned, you can forego knotting off one end and instead tie strands to a sturdy object, like a table or desk., Separate the strands into leftmost, middle-left, middle-right, and rightmost. Pass the rightmost strand under the two middle strands and over the leftmost. Take the new rightmost strand and pass it over the middle two and under the leftmost., In the same fashion as the previous step, continue braiding. Take the outermost right strand and alternate between passing it under the middle two and over the leftmost, and over the middle two and under the leftmost. Continue until 7 in (17.8 cm) of strands remain., Slide the strands through the metal loop of your collar clip so the clip is positioned over the point where the braiding transitions to separate strands. Fold the strand end up around the outside of the metal loop toward the braided section to encircle the loop. Fasten the strand end to the main braid just above the metal loop with string, durable tape, or rubber bands.The cordage will form a little loop around the metal loop of the collar clip. Keep the cordage snug so the collar clip isn’t loose.
Feel free to use a plastic collar clip in place of a metal one. The plastic clip, however, will likely degrade faster and require a future replacement., Splicing is the practice of weaving separate strands together.Starting as close to the collar clip as possible, loosen braided strands slightly with your pliers, forceps, or sturdy tweezers. Slide the tool through the gap in the loosened braid. Grip a single strand and pull it through.

, Continue to splice until the loose strands are about 3 in (7.6 cm) long. Spliced strands should alternate their weavings. A strand pulled through will move up the braided section to be pushed through the same strand further up the braiding.


If you’ve decided to use different colored strands to make a more colorful leash, match and splice same colored strands for a uniform appearance., Pull on the loose ends to tighten the braid. Remove the string or rubber bands fastening the now spliced strand end to the main braid directly above the metal loop of the collar clip. Use your scissors to cut the loose ends close to the braiding.


Pass the flame of a lighter or a hot hobby knife over the ends to melt and fuse them closed. Failing to do so could result in your braided leash unraveling or having a frayed appearance., Remove your cordage from the sturdy object it was fastened to while braiding, if necessary. Measure 7 in (17.8 cm) from the non-clip end of the rope. Fasten this point with string and a simple knot, rubber bands, or durable tape., If the braid is difficult to loosen with your fingers, insert a tool into the windings, like a small pair of pliers or a screwdriver. Work the tool back and forth until the braid loosens, or simply use the pliers to pull apart the braided strands.

, Starting at the fastener, measure out 18 in (45.7 cm) of braided cordage. Fasten this point in the same fashion you did the previously, with string, rubber bands, or durable tape. Align the two fasteners so they are directly next to each other., From this point on, you’ll be splicing the loosened strands to the main braiding in the same fashion you did for the collar clip. Weave loose strands back and forth into the main braid after the second fastener.

, Splice the stands into the main braid for several windings apiece. Remove your two fasteners on the cordage and discard them or save them for later. Pull on the loose strands to tighten the braiding. , Splice your loose strands up the main braid until there is perhaps around 3 in (7.6 cm) remaining, or until it becomes difficult to braid due to shortness. Cut the loose ends free with your scissors. Fuse these ends with your lighter or hot hobby knife. Enjoy walking your dog on your new leash."

Consider a halter for dogs that need more control.,
Talk to your veterinarian.,
Discuss a head halter with your dog trainer.,
Talk to a pet store employee.,
Read the manufacturers instructions.,
Place the halter on the dog.,
Attach the leach correctly.,
Expect an adjustment period.Having a halter on will be a whole new experience for your dog.,
Discontinue use of a retractable leash.The biggest danger associated with using a halter is that the dog's neck can be wrenched around and injured by force.,
Avoid jerking corrections.As with a retractable leash, jerking on a head halter can seriously injure a dog's neck.,
Watch for rubbing or discomfort.As with all dog equipment, you need to watch for rubbing and injuries caused by the halter after you use it.,
Remove halter when not in use.",How to Know if a Head Halter Is Right for Your Dog," Head halters are made to be used on dogs that pull too much when being walked. If the dog pulls, its head is pulled down and to the side by the halter, making the dog's forward movement more difficult. With proper use it can be an effective tool for stopping pulling behavior.If your dog's central behavior problem when walking is pulling, then the head halter may work great for correcting that behavior. If your dog is generally out of control, then it may need some general training before the head halter should be used.;
, In addition to limiting excessive and aggressive pulling, a halter can help people with limited mobility to walk even a well behaved dog. Even if a dog only pulls a little bit or once in awhile, it can be difficult for a person with limited mobility to handle. If a halter is put on their dog, however, it can eliminate occasional pulling that can knock them off their balance.This can help elderly people to walk their dogs, in addition to anyone who is generally unstable while walking their dog.

, While the halter is not a muzzle, and cannot totally stop a dog from biting, it can be used to control head movement. This means that the halter can be used to move your dog's head away from someone that it is attempting to nip or bite.


When using a halter like this you need to be careful not to wrench on the dog's neck, as this could cause injury. Instead, pull gently and do not pull so far that your dog's neck is over rotated.

, Discuss whether a head halter would be good to use on your dog. Your veterinarian may have reservations about its use depending on your dog's behavior or health, or the veterinarian may be enthusiastic about it given the potential benefits to your dog's behavior.Not all veterinarians will have a thorough understanding of the pros and cons of using a head halter. Ask ""Do you think a head halter might be good for my dog?"" or ""Do you have any opinions about using a head halter?"" If he or she is willing, allow them to do a little research and to get back to you about what they find out.

, Deciding to use a head halter can have a big impact on your dog's behavior and training level. If your dog is actively being trained by a professional, you should discuss this new equipment with them before using it with your dog.


Your trainer will probably have great instructions and tips for how to use the halter effectively and properly, as well as how it can be incorporated into the dog's training regime.Ask your trainer ""Do you have any tips or suggestions for me about using a head halter?""

, If you decide to use a head halter you may have quite a few to choose from. Feel free to discuss your options with the pet store employees at your local pet store to see which one they would choose and why. Perhaps there is one brand that is most popular and holds up well, and a pet store employee may be able to steer you towards that one.


Ask a store employee ""Have you ever used a head halter on a dog?"" If they say yes, ask ""How did it work for you?""
A pet store employee may also be able to help you pick the right size of halter, as well as helping to fit it correctly on your dog.

, After you purchase a head halter, which are available at most pet stores and online, you should read the directions on it. These instructions should outline how to use the halter and how to put it on and fit it correctly.


If your head halter doesn't come with directions and you are unsure how to put it on your dog, ask a pet store employee for help or take it with you when you take your dog to its veterinarian next time and ask them for help.

, The first thing to do is to open up the clip that holds the halter together. This will be closed again once the halter is on the dog. Then place the solid loop of the halter over the dog's nose. Once that is one, take the straps that have the clip ends and pull them around the dog's neck, right behind the ears.Adjust the tightness carefully. You want the halter to be tight enough to control your dog's movement but not so tight that it injures or makes your dog uncomfortable.
A good rule of thumb is to make sure that you can easily put a few fingers under the halter at the back of the dog's neck and that the dog can easily open and close its mouth. There are adjustment straps that can be moved to make the right fit possible.

, The leash should be attached to the front of the head harness, at the front of the neck under the chin. There should be a ring in this area of the halter for the leash to attach to.Attaching the leash in the correct spot will assure that the halter operates correctly.

, It will need time to adjust to its new situation and to its inability to pull any longer.


Begin by using the head halter for short walks. This will get the dog used to the new feeling. You can even use positive reinforcement techniques, such as giving treats, with the dog to reward good behavior with the harness.

, This danger is increased if you use the halter with a retractable leash.


A retractable leash will allow your dog to get moving rather quickly and then it will be stopped by the end of the line. With a halter, this will aggressively pull the dog's head around and could injure its neck.

, While it is reasonable to give a gentle and slow pull on the leash, any abrupt movement will not allow the dog to protect its neck and head.


The neck halter is best when used for keeping a dog at your side and giving it gentle corrections as you walk.

, Make sure the dog's snout and neck are not rubbed raw after use.


These should not occur if adjusted correctly, so readjust the halter is you notice any problems.

, A halter should only be on your dog when you are getting ready to walk it or it is actively walking. Otherwise, it should be removed for your dog's safety and comfort.While a dog can eat, drink, bark, lick, or bite while wearing the head halter, it shouldn't be worn when not supervised.

Watch the newborn puppies closely.,
Place the newborns on their mother’s nipples.,
Support the newborn puppy’s body.,
Make sure the newborns nurse every few hours.",How to Ensure Passive Immunity in Newborn Puppies1," In general, newborn puppies can easily find their mothers’ nipples and begin nursing.However, some newborns may have more trouble nursing. Because colostrum is vital to a newborn puppy’s survival, and is available for only a short time after birth, each newborn puppy will need to start nursing almost immediately after birth.


Watch each newborn puppy to see which ones are nursing and which ones are not. You will need to help those that aren’t nursing on their own.;
, For a newborn puppy that isn’t nursing on its own, use your hands to gently nudge its body toward a nipple. Place the nipple in the puppy’s mouth. At this point, the puppy should start nursing.Try some other tips for encouraging nursing:Touch the puppy’s cheek to the nipple. The puppy may then turn its face and place its mouth on the nipple.
If the puppy isn’t opening its mouth, gently pry it open with your index finger. Once its mouth is on the nipple, remove your finger from its mouth.
Do not place your fingers on the puppy’s cheeks. If your fingers are on its cheeks, it may try to start sucking on your finger instead of its mother’s nipple.

, Once the newborn is latched on to its mother’s nipple, it will need to use a pushing action to get the colostrum out. It may need your help with this. To help, support the puppy’s body by placing your hands on its belly. You can also place its front paws around the nipple., Up until they’re a few weeks old, puppies need to nurse every few hours. For the newborn puppies that need help with nursing, you may need to place them on their mother’s nipples every few hours for the first 24 hours to ensure they get their colostrum.Newborn puppies may get only a few drops of colostrum each time they nurse. That’s ok! Those few drops will help protect them from disease.Ensuring the newborns nurse every few hours may be exhausting for you. However, it will be worth it if they get enough colostrum to fight off infection.

Determine what the harness will be used for.,
Choose a back clip harness.,
Select a front clip harness.,
Pick a tightening harness.,
Choose a fabric type.,
Look at additional features.",How to Choose the Right Harness for Your Dog1," There are a number of different styles of harnesses available. Not all of them are designed to be used on walks, though this is what most people use harnesses for. There are a number of different styles that can be used for walking, like the front clip, back clip, or tightening harness.Dog mobility harnesses are used to help dogs who have trouble getting around, particularly senior dogs, and distribute the dog’s weight so you can lift them more easily. They are fitted the same as walking harnesses and your vet will have recommendations that are designed for your dog’s individual health needs.Harnesses that are used for sport or training purposes will need to be lighter, so look for harnesses without metal adjustment clips and are made of lightweight materials. You can also find sporting harnesses that allow you to add weight to them, which helps to strengthen your dog and add resistance.
You want the harness to be comfortable for your dog to wear and for you to use.;
, On this harness, the leash attachment ring is located on top of the dog’s back. These harnesses are easy for dogs to get used to since they are comfortable to wear and the leash won’t get tangled in their front legs.Back clip harnesses should only be used with dogs that are calm and trained. They shouldn’t be used with dogs that pull when they’re being walked since the harness won’t redirect this motion. They shouldn’t be used to correct behavioral issues, like aggression towards other dogs, since the harness doesn’t curb bad behaviors like other types do., Front clip harnesses have the leash attachment in the center of the dog’s chest rather than on their back. This way, the harness gives you more control over your dog if they pull when they walk. It also helps to redirect a dog to face the owner, if need be.Front clip harnesses are a good choice if your dog pulls when they walk and you want to correct that behavior. Be aware that the leash can tangle under your dog’s front legs if you give too much slack during your walk.

, There are different variations of tightening harnesses, but they all will tighten and add pressure when your dog pulls. The tightening is uncomfortable for your dog and they’ll lessen their pulling or stop all together. This type of harness is good to use with a determined puller who hasn’t broken this bad habit.Some tightening harnesses can cause pain, which is not what you want. The harness should add a slight pressure that is uncomfortable, so make sure that the harness does not hurt your dog.

, The majority of harnesses are made from nylon or another synthetic fabric, or from padded leather. Nylon harnesses are more easily adjusted and are better if you live in a humid area that has a lot of wet weather. In dry weather, both nylon and leather will do.You can also consider a harness with light padding. This padding makes the harness more comfortable for your dog to wear. Padded harnesses tend to be slightly more expensive, though if you are investing in a quality harness it is worth it.

, If you take your dog out for walks at night, consider a harness that has a reflective trim that will make your dog more visible You can also find a harness with a handle, which is a helpful training tool to help control you r dog. You can also lift your dog by the handle if they are small enough.


The looks of the harness shouldn’t be your first priority but once you’ve identified the proper type of harness that you need, you can choose between different colors and patterns.
You can also find water resistant harnesses that are easier to clean.

Have the mother stay still.,
Do not bathe the mother.,
Hydrate the mother.",How to Ensure Passive Immunity in Newborn Puppies2," The newborn puppies will have a harder time nursing if their mother isn’t staying still enough for them to latch on to her nipples. If the puppies’ mother isn’t staying still, hold her gently and tell her to stay. As the puppies nurse, her body will produce a hormone called prolactin that will help her relax and stay still., Soon after giving birth, a mother dog will lick her nipples to put saliva on them. This saliva will give off a scent that will encourage her newborns to find her nipples and start nursing. Since bathing will remove the saliva, do not bathe the puppies’ mother after she gives birth., A mother dog needs plenty of fresh water to stay hydrated. The better hydrated she is, the better able she will be able to produce colostrum for her newborns. Since she may not want to leave her newborns to get up and get water, place a water bowl close to where she is lying down.Refill the bowl with fresh water regularly.

Use frozen colostrum.,
Collect colostrum from your puppies’ mother.,
Have your vet collect plasma from a healthy dog.,
Give the newborn puppies the plasma.",How to Ensure Passive Immunity in Newborn Puppies3," Frozen colostrum from another mother dog can help ensure your newborn puppies receive passive immunity if they can’t nurse on their own. Work with your vet to freeze colostrum from another mother dog, before your puppies’ mother gives birth.Thaw the frozen colostrum to room temperature before giving it to the newborn puppies that will need it.
Ask your vet how many drops of thawed frozen colostrum to give the newborn puppies, and how often to give the drops.
Realize that frozen colostrum will not protect the newborn puppies from infection as well as fresh colostrum., You can also collect the colostrum yourself.To do this, gently squeeze the skin around the nipples. The colostrum will not be right at the nipple, so you will need to squeeze farther back from the nipple to get the colostrum out.Wash your hands before collecting the colostrum.
Mother dogs often start producing colostrum before birth. You may even see it leaking from the nipples.You could collect and freeze it at this point to prepare for passive immunity problems.
Collect the colostrum into a clean container. Consider asking your vet for clean plastic tubes in which you can collect the colostrum.
If you do not feel comfortable collecting the colostrum yourself, you can use colostrum from other healthy dogs.

, If colostrum is not an option, your puppies will need another way to get passive immunity. You can prepare for this possibility by having your vet collect plasma from a healthy adult dog, or the puppies’ mother, before the puppies are born.Plasma is a blood component that can provide immunity to newborn puppies.
Your vet will freeze the plasma in separate plastic tubes.
Serum, which is another blood component, can also provide immunity.Talk with your vet about collecting serum from a healthy adult dog.

, For the newborn puppies that aren’t nursing well, thaw the plasma to room temperature and give it to them by mouth using a medicine dropper.Place the dropper in the corner of the mouth to get it open.


To prevent the plasma from going into the puppy’s lungs, aim the dropper at an angle inside the mouth, instead of toward the back of the throat.
Your vet may recommend injecting the plasma under the skin instead. Your vet would administer this injection.Extremely sick newborn puppies may need plasma injections directly into their abdomens.Contact your vet as soon as you notice any of the newborn puppies are not nursing well. Your vet will tell you how many drops of plasma to give, and how often to give it, during the puppies’ first 24 hours of life.

Use a measuring tape.,
Measure the broadest part of their chest.,
Measure their neck.,
Weigh your dog.,
Match your measurements to the right size.,
Fit the harness.,
Purchase the harness.",How to Choose the Right Harness for Your Dog2," Most harnesses are sold by the weight of the dog but a measuring tape will give you a more exact measurement. You could take your dog to the pet store and try on different harnesses before buying one, but by measuring your dog at home, you can select the right size at the store without your dog being present.


Enlist the help of a friend or family member to help keep your dog still while you measure them if they won’t sit still.

, For most dogs, this will be behind their shoulder blades. Make sure you wrap the tape around them securely, but not too tight or too loose. This way you can make sure you get an accurate measurement.


Write down the measurement in both inches and centimeters. Different harness brands use different measuring systems so it’s best to have both numbers handy.

, You’ll need to use the measuring tape to measure the thinnest part of your dog’s neck. Again, write down the measurement in both inches and centimeters., Since most dog harnesses use weight to determine sizing, you’ll need to take an accurate measure of your dog’s weight. Some well-trained dogs can sit still on a scale long enough to get an accurate reading, but most will not.The easiest way to weigh your dog is to weigh yourself and then weigh yourself holding your dog. Subtract the latter number from the former and you have your dog’s weight.
You can also go to your veterinarian or groomer and have your dog weighed on their scales that are specifically designed for dogs.

, Now that you have measured and weighed your dog, you can see what harness size they are. On the packaging of harnesses, or in the descriptions online, you will see a range of measurements that correlate to a size. For example, a size small might fit dogs that are 15 to 30 pounds.


Be aware that your dog may fit in different sizes depending on the brand of the harness. So a dog that fits in a size large in Brand A might be an extra-large in Brand B.
If your dog is between sizes, choose the larger size and adjust it to fit your dog.

, The harness should fit your dog snugly, but not too tight. Look for a harness that has 4 to 5 adjustment points so you can adjust the harness to fit your dog perfectly. The harness may be the wrong size or improperly fitted if you see any of these signs:Chafing around the harness area.
Your dog can wriggle free.
The back part of the harness rotates side to side instead of staying put.
Your dog is strongly resisting walking with it on.

, You can find dog harnesses at every pet store, large retailers, and online. Now that you have identified the right type of harness that works for your dog, you can purchase one and beginning using it.

Weigh your puppies daily.,
Pull the largest puppies from the litter.,
Hand-feed the big puppies.,
Place the large puppies in a separate box.",How to Deal with Newborn Puppy Nipple Guarding1," If you have a large litter of puppies, you should weigh each puppy daily. This will help you track their weight gain and make sure that each pup is getting its dietary needs met. This will also help you highlight which puppies are nipple guarding and which puppies are malnourished.For the best results, use an electronic scale designed for weighing small animals.;
, Watch your puppies nurse so that you can get an idea of which puppies are exhibiting guarding behavior. If the mother is producing enough milk, remove the three or four largest puppies after they have nursed. This will give the smaller dogs an opportunity to feed.This will also prevent your bigger puppies from developing alpha tendencies such as resource guarding.

, If the mother is not producing enough milk, you should remove the larger puppies before they nurse and feed hand-feed them twice a day. This will ensure that they get enough to eat and do not diminish the mother’s milk supply for the small puppies. Talk with your veterinarian about getting the proper formula for your puppies.This will also help you curtail resource guarding in your larger puppies.
Once you begin bottle-feeding the larger puppies, you should not allow them to nurse any longer. This will affect the mother’s milk supply and could make the malnourishment of the smaller puppies worse.

, While their smaller siblings eat, leave the larger puppies in a box with a heating pad or a hot water bottle. The big puppies will be content with the warmth. Leave them in the box until the smaller puppies have finished nursing."

Let the little pups nurse after the big ones.,
Massage the mother’s mammary gland and stomach to encourage milk production.,
Rub their face on the nipple.,
Feed them an appetite stimulator.",How to Deal with Newborn Puppy Nipple Guarding2," Although it might seem like a good idea to let the smaller puppies nurse before their bigger siblings, this may actually tire out the little ones before the mother releases her milk. Instead, let the bigger pups nurse first, to release the mother’s milk, and then allow the smaller pups their chance. If the mother is producing enough milk, the bigger puppies will have the stamina to get the mother’s milk released, then you can make sure that the entire litter nurses.If the mother is not producing enough milk, you should skip this step and simply pull the larger puppies before they nurse.

, If the mother is having some difficulty releasing her milk, you can also rub her mammary glands and stomach. This will encourage milk production and make it easier for your smaller puppies to nurse. Be sure to do this before you rub the puppies' faces on the nipple., If a small puppy is struggling to nurse after you remove its larger siblings, it may need a little assistance. Try rubbing its face sideways against its mother’s nipple to get it to attach. This should help stimulate your puppy’s appetite and get it to start nursing., If the small puppy is still having trouble nursing, talk to your veterinarian about an appetite stimulator. This sugary supplement should energize your puppy and get its appetite going. Give the puppy a few drops of the appetite stimulator before nursing to perk its hunger."

Visit your veterinarian.,
Hand-feed the puppy.,
Spay your dog.",How to Deal with Newborn Puppy Nipple Guarding3," If your puppies are still struggling to nurse and gain weight, you should visit your veterinarian. The veterinarian may highlight another issue that is preventing your puppy from nursing properly or gaining weight. They may also recommend supplements and other dietary aids to help your fading puppy., Although you would ideally want to pull the larger puppies, you may also need to remove smaller or fading puppies in order to provide extra nourishment. You should only bottle-feed a puppy if it is too small and weak to nurse or if the litter is so large that there are not enough teats for each pup. Once you begin bottle-feeding any smaller puppies, make sure that you continue you to bottle-feed them. After you remove the puppy, the mother will only produce enough milk to supply the nursing puppies., The best way to prevent future nipple guarding and malnourishment is by spaying your dog. This is particularly important if you have a female dog that has already delivered a litter of puppies and struggled to produce enough milk. If your dog could not produce enough milk to feed its previous litter, make sure that you spay it before it goes into heat again.Unless you are a professional breeder, you should spay your dog before its first heat, which is around 5 to 6 months of age.

Talk to a certified dog training professional.,
Purchase a collar.,
Make sure you know how to properly fit the collar.,
Use for only an hour at a time.,
Use short tugs to correct behavior.,
Do not use a prong collar for a puppy.,
Use a harness or gentle leader for walks.,
Take the collar off when you're not supervising your dog.,
Stop using the collar once your dog no longer needs it.",How to Use a Prong Collar on Dogs," A prong collar is not simply another piece of walking equipment like a harness or a gentle leader. It is a training device. A prong collar should not be used without consulting a professional dog trainer.


A certified dog trainer will likely have experience using a prong collar or choke chain to discipline a dog. If used incorrectly, prong collars can be ineffective or even painful.A prong collar is used as part of a longterm training process that teaches your dog why pulling is not appropriate. It should not be used for walks that occur outside of training time. Casually using the collar for walks does not teach your dog pulling is inappropriate. It only teaches him pulling while wearing the prong collar is inappropriate. Talk to a trainer about how and when to best use the collar.;
, Many people are wary of prong collars due to the potential for pain. However, purchasing the right kind of prong collar lessens the likelihood your dog will experience pain while wearing it.


Quality prong collars are designed to gently pinch the loose skin around the dog's neck, providing negative reinforcement in the event of pulling and misbehaving. A good collar will never puncture your dog's skin.The right size is important. Collars are divided by weight distinction, so know how much your dog weighs before selecting a collar. If you buy a collar labeled ""For 100-120 pounds"" for a 75 pound dog, this is far more likely to cause your dog pain and discomfort than a properly sized collar.Buy a collar from a certified trainer or a certified trainer's website. Prong collars sold at chain stores like Petco are often not as well made and the prongs have sharp rather than rounded edges. This results in puncturing rather than pinching your dog's skin, which can lead to aggression during training sessions.Never buy a prong collar with rubber-tipped prongs. Many people think such an investment is more ethical but rubber can rub against your dog's hair, causing pain. Metal, on the other hand, moves smoothly over a dog's coat., A prong collar must be placed around a dog's neck in a specific manner to be safe and helpful for training purposes.


A prong collar should sit right behind the ears and under the jaw. Placing the collar lower than this will make the collar ineffective.The part of the collar that hooks onto a leash should be facing upward, just behind a dog's ears. Never clip the collar below a dog's jaw or on the side of the neck.The collar should fit snugly as it doesn't move around from the proper place. If the collar is loose, consider removing one of the prongs., A prong collar is a training device and not designed for longterm use. It is not your dog's primary collar and should not be used on casual walks or outings.


Use the collar for no more than one hour and only during designated training sessions. Using the collar any longer could irritate your dog's neck.It is dangerous to use a prong collar as your primary walking collar. Dogs learn by association. If, in the long term, your dog learns to associate pain with pulling he'll also learn to associate negativity with events that cause him to pull. Most friendly dogs pull in response to seeing other people and animals. If a prong collar is used on every walk, your dog will learn to associate people and animals with pain. With time, he'll become timid and even aggressive in the presence of others and might even begin growling and biting., A dog should never be allowed to freely tug on a prong collar. Prong collars are used during training sessions only to briefly correct behaviors.


Use short, firm tugs when your dog pulls or lunges in response to stimuli. Then, release the pressure. Your dog should let up when he feels the pull and it's unlikely you'll need much more than a quick tug.Prong collar mimics other dogs biting. A nip on the back of the neck from another pack member signifies a dog has stepped out of line and needs to behave. Constantly pulling or putting pressure on a dog's neck does not simulate a biting effect but rather causes a constant negative sensation. You do not want your dog to associate walks with pain., Prong collars are designed for larger, untrained dogs in order to teach leash manners. They are usually a last resort for dogs whose pulling problems are not resolved through other means. Puppies are new to walking and should not start off with the most intense level of training collar. This will only succeed in scaring a puppy. Also, prong collars are not safe until at least 5 or 6 months of age and, even then, they are not recommended unless other training methods have been exhausted., As stated, prong collars are used for training. Preferably use them under the supervision of a certified dog trainer. A better option for walking would be harness or gentle leader as they discourage heavy pulling but do so without putting unnecessary pressure on a dog's neck., Prong collars should not stay on a dog's neck like a regular collar.


Prongs can easily catch on objects leading a dog to become ensnared. If they pull to hard, they can choke and pass out. Prong collars can even be fatal if you leave them on without supervising your dog.It's not really necessary to leave a prong collar on when you're not training your dog. Unlike a conventional collar, prong collars do not contain tags or identifying information. They're merely used to train a dog and serve no other purpose., Prong collars are not meant for longterm use. Working with a certified trainer, get your dog to a place where he has learned proper leash manners and no longer pulls. Once your dog has mastered good walking techniques, you no longer need to use the collar.
